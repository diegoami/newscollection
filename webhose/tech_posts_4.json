{"posts": [{"title": "Dropbox Paper gets document previews and some other small updates", "text": "Dropbox continues to tune its products as it tries to tap a bigger audience within larger companies with some updates today to its collaboration tool Paper, including the ability to preview documents before loading them.\nAs a blank slate, Paper is increasingly popular with designers you might talk to in Silicon Valley. It basically turns the process of designing and building a product spec into a living, breathing flow of information online. As such, Dropbox seems to have started to recognize the opportunity of catering to these users as it starts the drip-drip-drip of incremental product updates to suit those popular needs.\nHere’s a quick rundown of what’s getting updated today: users are able to create folders on their mobile devices and move Paper documents into them; they can now delete or archive their Paper documents on their phones; finally, users can now preview Paper documents before opening them. All of these seem to be on the smallish side, but they’re worth noting as Dropbox is a company that touts its simplicity and has to take care not to feature creep a product like Paper.\nDropbox is also giving developers a way to create or edit Paper documents in their own apps, which is a move that will potentially move the product outside of the bounds of the traditional Dropbox experience. But this is also important because it gives third parties which are accustomed to working on these kinds of documents in their own environments a way to do that with Dropbox.\nThat’s a perpetual danger for any company that tries to lean on its brand as a simpler product, especially as the company tries to break into a mainstream enterprise tool that has to cater to dozens of different team requirements. Dropbox’s challenge is building a more generalized, abstract version of the collaboration tools you might find in other massive products.\nIt’s going to need to do just that as the company seems increasingly primed for an IPO. The company is reportedly following all the incremental steps toward going public. It’s inevitably going to be compared to companies like Box or Microsoft, but with an origin story as a consumer product, it has to provide a unique pitch if it looks to become a full-fledged business that’s able to tap both consumer and enterprise demand.", "tags": "paper", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/dropbox-paper-gets-document-previews-and-some-other-small-updates/", "id": "1533753"}, {"title": "Amazon and Microsoft agree their voice assistants will talk (to each other)", "text": "Those betting big on AI making voice the dominant user interface of the future are not betting so big as to believe their respective artificially intelligent voice assistants will be the sole vocal oracle that Internet users want or need.\nAnd so Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos are today announcing a tie-up, which will — at an unspecified point later this year — enable users of the latter’s Alexa voice assistant to ask her to summon Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant to ask it to do stuff, and vice versa.\nHere are the pair’s respective statements on the move:\nAnd here’s how they sum up the win-win benefits they see for their respective users by letting their voice assistants interoperate:\nThe main thing to note here — aside from how clumsy it’s going to be having one voice assistant summon another — is that Cortana and Alexa play in very different spheres; one being productivity and business user focused, and the other being ecommerce/entertainment and consumer focused.\nWhich means there’s little strategic reason for Alexa or Cortana to be overly territorial vis-a-vis each other at this point vs — on the flip side — the extra utility they reckon they can reap by agreeing to integrate their products and expanding the relative capabilities of each.\nSo really this alliance is mostly a commentary on the slender individual utility currently offered by each/any of these heavily hyped voice assistant technologies.\nIn an interview about the tie-up with The New York Times, Bezos envisaged a future where people are turning to different AIs for different areas of expertise — akin to asking one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.\n“I want them to have access to as many of those AIs as possible,” he is quoted as saying.\nBezos also professed himself open to the idea of interoperating with Apple’s Siri and Google’s eponymous voice AI — although he confirmed neither had been approached.\nAnd, to be clear, there seems zero chance of Apple and Google inking on the interoperability line, given they control the two dominant mobile ecosystems and therefore have different strategic ecosystem priorities vs Amazon and Microsoft (the two companies which, let us not forget, lost out in the mobile platform race).\nSo, in sum, if you can’t beat the dominant mobile platforms, you can at least forge wider product integrations to try to offer a more compelling app proposition.", "tags": "cortana,micrsoft", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/amazon-and-microsoft-agree-their-voice-assistants-will-talk-to-each-other/", "id": "1533486"}, {"title": "Apple and Accenture teaming up to help enterprises build advanced mobility tools", "text": "There is a general misconception that Apple is strictly about consumer tools, but the fact is that the company has a big presence in the enterprise just by the sheer number of iPhones and iPads in the business world. It also has some high-profile partnerships with hefty enterprise vendors like IBM, SAP and Cisco. Today, Apple announced that it is building on those relationships with a brand new partnership with Accenture, the global consulting firm.\nThe companies plan to work together to help customers build advanced digital projects on iOS devices. Apple of course brings its iOS expertise to the table. Accenture comes into play because it understands how to connect to legacy backend systems that are lurking inside every large enterprise organization. The company has also long worked with established companies that are trying to become digital operations. Both of these are targets for the new project.\nTen years after the iPhone debuted, there are more in-house iOS programmers and more mobile development projects than ever before, but companies have struggled to take advantage of iOS to build digital tools to truly transform organizations and how they operate, according to Susan Prescott, VP for apps, markets and services at Apple.\n“We’ve seen an increase in development efforts within companies. In fact, in the last three years, the number of in-house iOS developers has doubled,” she said. “So the demand is definitely there, but enterprises still need great partners to reinvent workflows and tap into backend systems.”\nShe adds, “This partnership with Accenture is about taking that further. What’s really exciting is that this isn’t just about optimizing existing apps and business processes — it’s about designing new apps and experiences using new technologies.”\nApple is looking to work directly with Accenture and enterprise customers to help them dig into enterprise data, and find new workflows that they have never considered before. This isn’t unlike what it has been doing (and continues to do) with IBM, but Apple says it’s going to have a seat at the table with Accenture personnel and share their expertise around iOS to help solve unique enterprise problems — and that is a big difference with this project.\nAs for Accenture, Gene Reznick, senior managing director for technology ecosystem and ventures for the firm, says they are looking to capitalize on some specific areas with this partnership including helping to create “engaging user experiences.” They hope to improve how organizations interact with customers in a digital way, something that continues to elude many companies. Secondly, they want to make that experience as meaningful as possible by building connections to relevant back-end systems and surfacing helpful data.\nWhile this could take many forms, they see exploiting the burgeoning area of Internet of Things, where they could build iOS applications to help monitor large industrial machines or other complex operations from an iPad or iPhone. They could supplement this idea by building augmented reality applications with Apple’s AR development toolset, ARKit to help with training or repair assistance right on the iOS device.\nFor starters, the teams will work together in San Francisco, but the hope is that over time, they will expand the project and build additional teams at some subset of the 30 Accenture Studios located throughout the world.", "tags": "partnerships,accenture,ios,apple-inc", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/apple-and-accenture-teaming-up-to-help-enterprises-build-advanced-mobility-tools/", "id": "1532738"}, {"title": "Tests put Galaxy Note 8 at the top of the smartphone display heap", "text": "If you like to keep on top of the latest display tech, you’re probably familiar with Ray Soneira’s exhaustive testing of the screens on the newest smartphones and other devices. His latest target is the Galaxy Note 8, and it turns out Samsung’s excellent phablet sports the best screen they’ve ever seen on a phone.\nIt shouldn’t come as that great of a surprise — OLED screens are the future, of course, and although early models were far from competitive, steady improvements have led to the tech leapfrogging traditional LCDs.\nBut don’t take my word for it. Look at that beautiful signature up top. And more importantly, Soneira’s article concludes:\nOf particular interest were the phone’s multiple calibrated display modes, all of which have as good or better color accuracy than the best screens out there — but have subtle or not-so-subtle differences in how they render an image. There’s also a user-adjustable white balance setting, which photographers and anyone sensitive to color temperature will appreciate.\nThe full rundown of new and improved features is worth reading, so take a few minutes to check out the state of the art.\nAn interesting thing to think about given the surpassing excellence of the Note 8 display is whether others — particularly Apple — can challenge them. If the iPhone is indeed going to go to OLED soon, it likely wouldn’t be able to claim anything but playing catch-up, though Apple has been spinning its catch-up moves pretty well over the last few years. But although its IPS LCDs are counted among the best in the world, it’s going to be a stretch for them to say they’re superior to the competition.\nRight now, however, the main problem is there just aren’t enough of the high-quality OLED units to supply everyone who wants them, let alone Apple. So it’s a bit of a moot point for the present. 2018, however, may be a very interesting one for the display market.", "tags": "smarthph,galaxy-note-8", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/tests-put-galaxy-note-8-at-the-top-of-the-smartphone-display-heap/", "id": "1532442"}, {"title": "Where does Blue Apron go after Amazon wraps up its Whole Foods deal?", "text": "Last week, Amazon said that its massive $13.7 billion deal to acquire Whole Foods is wrapping up on Monday — giving it access to one of the strongest food brands in the United States, as well as hundreds of grocery stores in metropolitan areas.\nThat means it’s going to be easier and easier for people to get access to great ingredients, and there’s been a continued trickle of suggestions that Amazon will be gunning for a massive business that helped Blue Apron go public — a trickle that has since tempered Wall Street’s appetite for that business.\nAll this raises a ton of questions as to what the future of Blue Apron is as Amazon looks primed to bulldoze into its territory in a very Amazon move. But as the specter of Amazon getting into meal-kit delivery looms, let’s review really quickly what Blue Apron has going for it:\n\nStill, Blue Apron’s stock fell quite dramatically again after it released its most-recent quarterly earnings report, even though the business showed some signs of life. It signaled that the company would likely continue to see losses going forward — projecting a net loss between $121 million and $128 million. Investors looking for a kind of performance like the flash of life that it showed earlier even amid a heavy burn rate to acquire customers seem likely to be disappointed in the near term as the company calibrates for a future where Amazon may go after its business.\nWhile Blue Apron requires an aggressive marketing engine — especially as it tries to expand beyond metropolitan areas, which are probably its sweet spot — still seems primed for a product that could grow organically. One example would be that the product seems like a very natural fit for a gift for occasions like weddings, birthdays or the holidays. This seems like obvious low-hanging fruit, where it can turn around and rely on that branding and consumer experience in order to convert those customers to more long-term ones and start the cycle again.\nBlue Apron can again lean on that strong brand that it’s built as one of the big anticipated consumer IPOs for 2017, even if it was a flop. Blue Apron at the beginning of 2018 — if it can last out to the holiday quarter — may end up looking like a much healthier Blue Apron at the middle of 2017.\nTo be sure, Blue Apron’s growth has greatly decelerated (in the same fashion most companies do as they mature), and there really isn’t a lot of data to predict that forward:\n\nOne of Blue Apron’s biggest challenges may end up being Amazon’s Prime business. The company said Prime members will soon see “special savings” when it comes to Whole Foods, which could end up being pretty much anything. Knowing Amazon, it’s likely to run a ton of experiments to figure out how to quickly quash any competitors and then decide how to grow it into a mature, profitable business later.\nIn the end, the drip-drip-drip of aggressive news about a potential Amazon competitor will probably continue to put a lot of pressure on Blue Apron, especially as it still seems to be racking up losses. But the company has shown that it’s willing to re-orient itself following the IPO, including making some changes in the executive ranks and some organizational changes.\nAnd while Amazon even seems to be testing a product in the vein of Stitch Fix, that company has still filed confidentially to go public — and is going to charge forward despite the specter of Amazon. There are still a lot of things going for the company and, if it’s able to lean on what initially made it able to expose that huge business, Blue Apron may have a shot to be a company that continues to exist even if the Amazon behemoth tries to get into its market.", "tags": "blue-apron,whole-foods", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/where-does-blue-apron-go-after-amazon-wraps-up-its-whole-foods-deal/", "id": "1532012"}, {"title": "Essential Phone begins shipping to customers", "text": "The Essential Phone started arriving in the hands of media and reviewers just last week, and as of today it’s now also shipping out to its first customers.

That’s the latest from comScore’s newly released 2017 U.S. Mobile Apps Report, which finds that 57 percent of consumers’ time spent using digital media is now taking place in mobile apps. Of that, 50 percent is occurring in smartphone apps versus only 7 percent for apps on tablets.\nDesktop is trailing further behind, accounting for 34 percent of time spent, while mobile web is another 9 percent.\n\nThe use of mobile apps to engage with digital media is even higher among younger users. comScore found that among those aged 18 to 24 years old, two-thirds of their digital media time is spent using smartphone apps alone. Not surprisingly, that percentage drops steadily the older the user, with just 27 percent of seniors 65 and older spending their digital media time in smartphone apps, for instance.\nBeyond digital media time, the younger millennials – those 18 to 24, that is – are just heavily using apps in general. They spend more than 3 hours per day in apps, compared with 2.6 hours for 25 to 34-year olds and 2.3 hours for 35 to 44-year olds, for example.\n\nIn contrast to these findings about apps’ continued popularity and frequent usage, users aren’t rushing out to try new ones, it seems.\nA majority of users (51%) still don’t download any apps in a month, says comScore.\n\nOf those who download one or more apps on average in a month (49%), 13 percent download just one app, 11 percent download 2 apps, 8 percent download 3 apps, 5 percent download 4 apps, 7 percent download 5 to 7 apps, and 5 percent download 8 or more.\nAgain, it’s millennials (18-34) who are driving much of the interest in new app downloads, the report also finds. 70 percent say they’re always looking for new apps to try, and they’re willing to pay. 1 in 5 downloads an average of one paid app per month, and nearly half make five or more in-app purchases per year.\n\nOther age groups show little interest in new apps, with only 37 percent of those 35 to 54 having interest in new and interesting apps, for example.\nThe majority (66%) buys zero paid apps per month, and 58% makes zero in-app purchases per year. What’s worse, they’re also often deleting the apps they already have on their devices.\nWhile 57 percent of millennials say they download new apps more often than they delete old ones, only 30 percent of those aged 35 to 54 can say the same.\nPeople say they remove apps because they’re just not using them, their interest has waned, their phone needed decluttering, or because they need more storage space.\nThis isn’t the first report to find that most users aren’t downloading new apps. comScore spotted this trend back in 2014; it came up again last year in a report released in September.\nThat this hasn’t changed over time is telling. It points to a sort of saturation point for apps, in terms of everyday use. Facebook and Google, which have 8 apps out of the top 10, are enough for most people.\nToday, the majority of app users access 20 or fewer apps per month, and their number one most-used app accounts for half of all their time spent using apps. Their top 10 most-used apps account for nearly all the time they spend in apps. That leaves little room for newcomers.\nEven breakout hits like Snapchat aren’t finding traction on older users’ phones, it appears. The apps is #3 among 18- to 24-year-olds and #6 among 25- to 34-year-olds, but doesn’t make the top 8 for any user over the age of 34.\nThe data almost makes it seem like there’s not much point in trying to build new apps for anyone but millennials, as they’re the only group showing serious interest in downloading more, a willingness to pay, and the ability to adopt a new app at scale.\nThe report also looks more deeply into other habits of this younger demographic, even noting odd tidbits like how they’ll delete apps with bad logos, how they tend to organize apps into folders, and how they position apps on their device for easy access with their thumb, among other things.\nThe full report is available from comScore’s website here.", "tags": "trends,mobile,apps,comscore", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/majority-of-u-s-consumers-still-download-zero-apps-per-month-says-comscore/", "id": "1531583"}, {"title": "Wattpad moves into video with personal storytelling app, Raccoon", "text": "Wattpad, the social publishing platform behind apps for sharing original stories and chat fiction, is today venturing into video with the launch of a new app called Raccoon. Unlike its predecessors, Raccoon will focus on non-fiction video-based storytelling, with the goal of connecting people who want to create and watch stories that either entertain or inspire.\nWhile Raccoon still fits within Wattpad’s broader mission of building modern-day storytelling products for web and mobile, the app feels like a more social experience. Instead of reading stories from authors whose real identities are often hidden behind handles, watching a Raccoon video is more like tuning into a YouTube vlog. The storyteller is right there on the screen, sharing something personal with you.\nAt launch, you can favorite stories by tapping a heart, or post them outside the app by clicking the share button, but Raccoon (perhaps smartly) doesn’t offer a commenting feature at this time.\n\nIf you want to participate in the community by posting your own video, you can click the plus sign at the bottom of the app to start recording. For those who aren’t sure what to talk about, there’s also an “I need inspiration” button that offers a story prompt.\nEach week, there are new story challenges in the form of prompts. For example, this week, Raccoon is prompting users to share their travel stories. If the weekly challenge isn’t of interest, you can swipe left for more ideas, like “what’s unique about your family?,” “share a memorable childhood experience,” “share your biggest Tinder-fail,” “share a funny story that happened at work,” etc.\n\nThese stories are tagged, so you can find more of the same while browsing the app.\nWhile recording, you can see when your video hits the 60-second mark – a subtle reminder that Raccoon wants videos that are only a minute or two long.\nThe app was developed out of Wattpad’s internal incubator, Wattpad Labs, which is also where its newer chat fiction app Tap got off the ground. Today, that app is the #7 app in the Books category on the App Store, just a couple of spots behind Wattpad itself. It has since grown to include over 300,000 stories. Meanwhile, Wattpad’s monthly audience is now 60 million.\nHowever, both Wattpad apps on the App Store are trailing two other top chat fiction apps, Hooked and Yarn.\n“Wattpad’s vision is to entertain and connect the world through stories, and as part of this we are constantly looking for innovative ways to evolve the storytelling process,” explains company co-founder Ivan Yuen about Wattpad’s move into video. “We know that video will play an important role in the future of storytelling and wanted to create a place where storytellers can authentically connect with audiences around shared experiences,” he adds.\nThe new app is designed to appeal to those aged 18 to 35. This age group, Yuen says, is already accustomed to the Snapchat’s and Musical.ly’s short, vertical video format, but are craving “more substance and meaningful connections with people,” he believes.\nRaccoon has been in testing in Canada ahead of today’s launch.

That’s just one of the innovative features of new photo-sharing social network Polygram. Using facial detection, Polygram gives you analytics about the emotional reactions people have to the photos you post.\nPolygram also has augmented reality makeup that lets you look more attractive instead of just silly like with masks in other apps. Plus, it’s developed a smart method of preventing screenshots where you can cover your photos like a fogged-up window, and people may only wipe clean a portion of the screen at a time.\nAfter raising $2.1 million in seed funding, today Polygram launches its iOS app with dreams of usurping Instagram and Snapchat.\n\nIt will be a tough uphill climb, especially if the social giants copy Polygram’s emotion detection and other cool features. But co-founder Faryar Ghazanfari thinks it can grow by attracting users who want to A/B test their social media with Polygram’s facial analytics to pick what to post elsewhere.\n“Influencers and content creators are the oxygen in this ecosystem,” Ghazanfari tells me. “We have white glove service for influencers, with full-time employees that just create custom features for them.” If the app can deliver enough utility and views, he thinks people might start purposefully sharing on Polygram too.\nI met Ghazanfari at TechCrunch’s annual summer August Capital party. He asked about a story I wrote about Facebook acquiring a company called FacioMetrics that had researched letting you Like photos by smiling, then claimed his fledgling startup Polygram had actually built that. The demo was impressive.\nWith just a minimal 20 milliseconds of lag, Polygram shows a wireframe mirror of your face that recognizes a wide variety of emotions corresponding to different emoji. It relies on an artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to detect how your face moves and map it to a specific emotion. As I smiled, frowned and raised my eyebrows, Polygram accurately surfaced the related emoji.\n\nThis tech is the basis of Polygram’s Instagram-ish social network. When sent a private message, you can respond with a face-triggered emoji reaction. And when you post a photo, you’ll see the emotional response tallies of your audience, though without names attached so you can’t get mad at a friend for looking grossed-out by your selfie. You also can see exactly where around the world your viewers are, and get audience breakdowns by demographic if you only care how a certain gender feels about your post.\nSome extra features include the ability to post permanent or ephemeral photos and videos, with the option to make a disappearing image everlasting after you post it. There are the typical Snapchat-style face filters, but there also are more subtle ones designed to beautify you like Meitu instead of making you puke rainbows or look like a puppy.\nPerhaps the savviest feature, and the one I almost hope Snapchat or Instagram copies, is Polygram’s “wipe-to-reveal.” It lets you choose to protect your private messages from screenshots.\nWhen delivered, your friend will see a blurry image as if was behind a condensation-covered window. By wiping a finger over the photo, they clear the fog and are shown what’s underneath. But the fog quickly reappears, so only a swath of the photo is visible at a time. With enough wiping, you’ll see and remember the whole image piece by piece, but if you try to screenshot or take a photo with a second camera, only the currently visible section will be recorded. Plus, you’ll be alerted if they screenshot it, and get sent a copy of what they captured.\nStarting a new social network from scratch is incredibly difficult. People have already made their connections on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. They loathe the chore of rebuilding this graph, posing a stiff challenge for Polygram.\nGhazanfari hopes to overcome this by recruiting influencers who’ll bring their own audiences with them. He says it’s already signed up a bunch who’ve been helping it refine Polygram’s features, and it wants to give them personal attention that Snapchat has notoriously denied to social media stars. “And in terms of monetization, we put these guys ahead of ourselves,” Ghazanfari declares.\nBut Polygram will have to sign up plenty of users to watch these web celebs, since they’ll only invest time in a platform that grows their fan base. Even with all its snazzy features, that may prove very tough, especially without much funding for traditional marketing.\nStill, if Polygram’s app fails to gain mass traction, I’d bet its slick interface ideas will live on, whether it’s copied or acquired by the social juggernauts.", "tags": "selfie-masks", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/polygram/", "id": "1531440"}, {"title": "In iOS 11, Safari will strip out Google AMP links for shared stories", "text": "Anyone haunted by annoying link cruft will be relieved to hear that iOS 11 will transform Google AMP links back into their original forms when sharing a story from Safari.

That financing round values the company at $1.5 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.\nThat wouldn’t just give VIPKID unicorn status — it also exposes a huge amount of demand there is in China and other countries as a tool to learn English from English speakers. VIPKID had raised $100 million in financing in August last year and already seemed to have quite a bit of momentum at the time. This financing round was led by Sequoia Capital, including a strategic investment from Tencent.\nVIPKID is a play that taps into the growing need for training in English in China. While that’s the sweet spot for VIPKID right now, a service like this has natural applications in other countries as well. But at the moment, China is such a big market that it can already support a company with a $1.5 billion valuation that started in 2013. It’s become one of the largest resources of English tutoring for children and has attracted venture interest from basically all directions.\nIf you haven’t heard of VIPKID out in our little Silicon Valley bubble, it’s probably for the reason above: it’s huge outside of the U.S. The company said that it has more than 20,000 teachers delivering lessons to 200,000 paying students from 32 countries. It also said it had monthly revenue of $60 million in July this year and is projecting annual revenue of $750 million. Including this round, VIPKID has raised $350 million in venture financing.\nVIPKID fills an interesting niche that helps English speakers — whether teachers or other professions — put in a bit of time to make a little extra money on the side. It’s a unique twist on the education model, putting it closer to an Uber model. There are other spins on online foreign language education like Duolingo, which raised $25 million at a $750 million valuation in July this year, but it seems like VIPKID has tapped into some kind of use case at the right time to get the attention of investors.\nVIPKID founder Cindy Mi’s longtime focus on teaching English basically morphed into a platform that’s tapped into growing demand amid an increasingly global economic environment.

Further, the team expects to be able to use this system inside of robotics where a softer, squishier connector is needed.\n“Combining big data and artificial intelligence technologies, the wireless biosensors can be developed into an entire medical system which allows portable access to collection, storage, and analysis of health signals and information,” said Jang. “We will continue further studies to develop electronic skins which can support interactive telemedicine and treatment systems for patients in blind areas for medical services such as rural houses in mountain village.”", "tags": "robot", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/new-wearable-tracker-can-transmit-vital-signs-from-a-soft-tiny-package/", "id": "1529834"}, {"title": "So, when will your device actually get Android Oreo?", "text": "Google officially just took the wraps off of Android Oreo, but there are still some questions left to be answered — most notably, precisely when each device will be getting the latest version of the mobile operating system. Due to Android’s openness and a variety of different factors on the manufacturing side, it’s not an easy question to answer, but we’ll break it down best we can. \nFirst the good news: If your device was enrolled in the Android Beta Program, you’ll be getting your hands on the final version of the software “soon,” according to Google. Exactly what that means remains to be seen, but rest assured that you’ll be one of of the first people outside of Google to take advantage of picture-in-picture, notification dots and the like. \nNo big surprise, Google handsets will be the first non-beta phones to get the update. The Pixel, Nexus 5X and 6P are at the top of the list, alongside Pixel C tablet and ASUS’s Nexus Player set-top box, which will be receiving the upgrade in spite of being discontinued late last year. \nBeyond that, the answer differs greatly from company to company. In most cases, the latest flagship is a no-brainer for an upgrade, and there may even be a handful of devices announced at IFA in a few weeks that will ship with the update out of the box. We’ve reached out to the manufacturers to find out what to expect. \nBlackBerry: A spokesperson for TCL/BlackBerry told us, “I can confirm that BlackBerry KEYone will get the upgrade.” No date listed. \nHTC: Similarly, a spokesperson confirmed that the U11 will indeed be getting Oreo eventually, though, “We haven’t announced timing yet. More info to come in the future.”\nLG: The company is certainly bullish about the new operating system, tweeting out an Oreo/eclipse teaser ahead of the event. Compatibility seems like a no-brainer for the forthcoming V30, along with recent flagships, though the company has yet to confirm\nMotorola: Motorola is similarly committed to bringing Oreo to its flagships, but sounds even more cautious with regards to timing. “Once Android O is fully released,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch, “we will begin working on the new code for our devices – as always, we know upgrades are about getting it right and making sure the phone performance remains the best it can be.”\nOnePlus: The company has already semi-officially announced that the new OS will arrive on the 3 and 3T this year— presumably the OnePlus 5 will be getting it around then, as well. \nSamsung: As always, Samsung does things on its own schedule — though it seems pretty likely that the big flagships, including the S8 and the forthcoming Note 8, will get it. Perhaps we’ll hear more on the latter at this week’s Unpacked event. \nSony: The company has yet to issue an official statement with regards to when its Xperia line will be getting the upgrade, but the Xperia X, XZ and XA seem like likely first candidates.\nWe’ll be updating this story as more manufacturers respond to our request.", "tags": "android-oreo,android-o", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/so-when-will-your-device-actually-get-android-oreo/", "id": "1529254"}, {"title": "Android Oreo vs iOS 11: What’s different and what’s the same?", "text": "Google just announced Android Oreo and it packs a handful of new features. Some are at the system level and speed up the system and extend the battery life, while others are features that will change the way users interact with their phone.\nA lot of these features should be familiar to iPhone and iPad owners. Normally Apple is the one accused of copying Android, but for Android Oreo, Google lifted a handful of features straight from iOS, while a couple of new functions are hitting Android before iOS.\n\nGoogle cribbed iOS for Android’s new notification scheme. In Android Oreo there will be a little dot in the top-right corner of the app’s icon to represent a notification. This has been a staple in iOS since the first iPhone and third-party Android launchers have long featured the scheme, too.\nGoogle even copied how users interact with the notifications, too. A long press on an icon with a notification badge reveals a pop-up menu that presents the user with several tasks — just like an iOS 3D Touch interaction.\nIn the end, it’s a win to the user that Google copied this system. These dots have survived numerous iOS revisions for a reason: they work.\n \nBoth Android Oreo and iOS 11 are getting new emojis because emojis are the future of humanity. And Google completely redesigned their take on emojis for Android Oreo. Gone are the blobs and traditional, round emojis have returned.\nGoogle’s new emojis follow Apple’s move to increase the detail found on the little faces. Yet according to a preview by Apple’s Tim Cook, iOS is about to get emojis that are even more detailed.\nThis tweet by Apple’s CEO shows emojis with a crazy level of detail. Apple has yet to say when the new characters will hit iOS, but it’s logical to expect them in the general release of iOS 11 and High Sierra.\nAndroid has supported copy and paste functions from the first release and has often led iOS’s implementation of the user interaction. It’s a critical function, yet the small screen size of phones often means copy and pasting is a clumsy affair. Android Oreo now makes it even easier to copy text and perform an action.\nCalled Smart Text Selection, when a user highlights, say an address, a link to Maps will be displayed next to the standard actions of copy, cut and paste. If a series of digits that looks like a phone number is highlighted, the phone app will be displayed.\nThis is sort of like how data detectors work in iOS, but Google’s feature looks to be more comprehensive, and it’s powered by Google’s AI for smarter identification.\nApple added picture-in-picture to the iPad in iOS 9 and Android is now gaining the capability, too. But with Android Oreo, phones can get in on the PiP action, too, which is something missing from the iPhone.\nAndroid Oreo’s PiP mode works as expected. It allows users to minimize a video and let it float on top of the screen while other tasks are performed behind it. This video window can be moved around the screen to best position it.\nRight now iOS limits this process to the iPad, though that could change in the future.\nAndroid Oreo finally brings the ability to have apps auto-fill user information like user names, passwords and addresses. Password manager apps have long performed some of these functions, but through convoluted means. Apps can now implement the Autofill API so the interaction should be much more seamless.\niOS kind of has a similar function, but it’s mostly reserved for a few apps, like Amazon’s, and it’s not nearly as omnipresent as it is in Safari on the web.", "tags": "oreo,android-oreo", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/android-o-vs-ios-11-whats-different-and-whats-the-same/", "id": "1529008"}, {"title": "Sony’s RX0 is a tiny camera with big ideas", "text": "Sony just announced a new camera called the RX0, but breaking from the trend of lower number = fancier camera, this one is a tiny device that combines an action-cam form factor with some traditional imaging prowess.

But it lacks a zoom and many of the other useful features of a pocket camera like the RX100. So you’re not going to be walking around taking snapshots with this thing.\nIt seems that the RX0 is being put forth as a sort of modular system for videographers who need the ruggedness and versatility of a GoPro but want a bit more control and fidelity. B cameras on set and outside (depending on the image quality), shooting from multiple angles (multiple RX0s can sync together), super slow-mo footage (it goes up to 960 FPS), and so on.\nWhile its $700 price tag might be a bit much for people who just want a camera to attach to their bike or surfboard, there are plenty of people who would opt for the RX0 instead of a GoPro.\nIt’s an odd little device, no doubt, but the more I think about it, the more I feel I’d prefer it for non-traditional duties.

You can connect to the Theta V from your smartphone using the companion app, either via Bluetooth LE for remote control, or via Wi-Fi for when you also want to transfer over photos and videos to your phone.\nAnother new feature unique to the Theta V is software plug-in support, which means Ricoh can add features to the camera over time. The first feature to take advantage of the plug-in system is a remote playback function, which allows mirrored playback from the camera directly to compatible connected TVs and other smart streaming devices.\nSpacial audio capture is also a pretty cool thing to add directly in the camera itself, which isn’t found on many of the Theta V’s more modern competitors.

So while the quality of Libratone’s audio is more premium than Amazon’s Echo speaker hardware, its existing microphones (previously used to support a conference call functionality) aren’t as tuned for this use-case — ergo there will be more friction between you and Alexa’s ‘lazy web’ answers to your voice commands.\n(Or more privacy safeguards between you and Amazon’s data-harvesting AI, depending on your perspective.)\nRival speaker maker Sonos had already been expected to unveil its own voice play on October 4. And according to an FCC filing, Sonos intends to introduce support for multiple voice assistants to existing speaker hardware.\nBut Libratone’s opening gambit here is to start with just Amazon’s Alexa as its chosen partner for ‘smartifying’ its premium hardware.\nAsked why it’s adding Alexa Libratone’s president, Mike Culver, told TechCrunch it had noticed some customers already using their Zipps with Amazon’s entry level Echo Dot device — so seeking to control their Zipp via Alexa voice commands sent to the ever-listening Dot.\n“We started investigating additional integrations that would make sense based on the consumer demand — for the Amazon Alexa capabilities, but available in a much better quality sounding speaker, which is why they’re purchasing Zipp and Zipp Mini and pairing it with the Echo Dot,” he said. “That was the stimulus.”\n“Then when we looked at the bigger picture we fundamentally believe that one of the key interfaces, from a usability standpoint for our speakers, should evolve to include voice. It’s a natural way to interact with our speakers and with music. And we believe the speaker also serves as a natural integration point to the smart home.\n“So both of these led us to integrate with Amazon,” he added.\nWhat happens if a customer does not want their speaker to be turned into an Amazon-enabled listening outpost? Culver said that while the user does not have a choice to decline the firmware update, they would need to take additional steps to actually enable and activate Alexa. And thus could choose not to.\n“After the Libratone Zipp or Zipp Mini speaker have the firmware update for Amazon Voice Services, the user will need to use the Libratone App to enable and configure it,” he confirmed. “The Libratone App will include a step that will take you to the Alexa App (and require you to download it if you do not already have it), where you will register the Zipp/Mini speaker for use with Amazon Voice Services.  Afterward, you will be passed back to the Libratone App for final confirmation.” \nCulver also noted that as part of the Alexa App registration a user would have to accept Amazon’s privacy policy, since they will be using Amazon’s voice services. Though, again, Zipp owners not wanting to agree to their personal data being processed by the ecommerce giant can do so by avoiding registering for the Alexa app.\n“All of our updates require the customer to authorize the update to the speaker… And once they update — and we’re always doing updates so eventually all the speakers will have this capability — they still have to configure it for it to start working,” added Culver, further emphasizing that even users who do configure Alexa still have to manually touch a button on the top of the speaker and say the word “Alexa” to summon the AI.\nTherefore, he said, Libratone will not be updating its own privacy policy ahead of this impending update as it does not believe it needs to.\n“That’s the difference between farfield microphones, that are just continuously listening, vs the way we’ve implemented it — which is based on the use-case that the customer has to intentionally want to do this. They have to touch the bird [logo on the button on top of the speaker] and at the same time give the Alexa voice command,” he added.\n“We are planning to add the possibility to disable [the Alexa integration] from within the Libratone App if customers wish to do so,” he also noted.\nCulver would not comment on whether Libratone is planning to launch any new speaker models in future with the Alexa AI baked in from the get-go plus microphone hardware that is always listening.\n“This is what we think is a really good first step,” he added. “And we’re always studying voice as a user interface — and I think all the questions that you’re asking are the same ones that we’re continually asking ourselves… so we’ll see how this [space] evolves both in implementation as well as with other competing voice services in the future.”\nIn another integration twist, Amazon and Microsoft yesterday announced a forthcoming tie-up will enable users of Alexa to summon Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant, and vice versa. So, in future, it may end up that enabling one voice assistant means being able to get in touch with any of them — at least, that’s Jeff Bezos’ prediction.\nIn the meanwhile, Libratone owners enabling the Alexa integration can certainly look forward to being able to ask the AI to summon Cortana too — if they really want to use their speaker to update their calendar or check something in Outlook.\nFor now it looks like the immediate future of voice interfaces will be voice assistants nested within voice assistants — in an attempt to make the technology more useful. Let’s just hope all these various vocal summons don’t result in cacophonous confusion of AI assistance.\nWhat’s the collective noun for a group of voice AIs?

Before launching Pium, Kihm and Hwang worked on the invention team of a Seoul-based accelerator, helping early-stage startups develop their IP portfolios. While doing research, the two determined that olfaction, or the sense of smell, is set to become the subject of “the next big UX technology,” Kihm told TechCrunch in an email.\n“The U.S. home fragrance market is about $6 billion, but still customers just rely on their personal preferences and advertisements to pick a product. Many options are on the market, but people still don’t know how to choose one,” he said.\nScented candles often contain potentially harmful ingredients like benzene, but essential oils can also be confusing to use. Pium’s software analyzes data to understand what associations people attach to different aromas and make personalized recommendations. Its diffuser uses pods pre-filled with essential oil blends. Kihm says this not only give Pium a source of continuous revenue after selling the diffuser, but is also more convenient for its customers because they don’t have to mix oils themselves or clean their Piums.\nJust as importantly, pods also let Pium have more control over user experience. Pium’s system selects different scents to release based on the time of day (for example, it can diffuse lavender-based scents at night before switching to something more invigorating in the morning) and detects its users’ locations so it can turn on automatically before they arrive home.\nIn the future, Pium also plans to offer a subscription service that automatically ships new blends to customers when their pods start running low. The diffusers are currently available for pre-order and are being tested at Bodyfriend HQ, a cafe and lounge in Seoul.", "tags": "fragrance,diffuser,pium", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/pium/", "id": "1534234"}, {"title": "Andy Rubin describes the taste of crow after Essential spills customer data", "text": "Launching a product and company from scratch is hard, as fresh-faced entrepreneurs and Kickstarter successes often learn to their chagrin.

But a robot from Swiss roboticists does the opposite: its little muscles tense when the air in them is removed. It’s cool — but it also looks kind of gross.\nI mean, come on:\nEach little section has several muscles, each of which can be contracted to different degrees to twist that section and exert force in some direction. All in one direction and the bot bends over; do it rhythmically and it can walk, or at any rate wriggle along. Or the vacuum could be let out in a suction cup, allowing the bot to attach securely to a wall, as  you see up top.\nIt was developed by Jamie Paik and Matt Robertson at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), who describe it in a paper published in the new journal Science Robotics.\nAnd although other robot-like devices have used vacuum for various purposes — we had one on stage that used vacuum to safely grip fragile items — the researchers claim this is the first bot that works entirely by vacuum. The contractive action created by the vacuum isn’t just unique, it’s practical, Paik told me in an email.\n“Compared to expanding actuators, contraction is more similar to the function of biological muscle,” she said. “Without going in to more precise and detailed mimicry, this might be functionally enough an advantage in terms of applications; to mimic real muscles in cases when you’d like to work with/augment/assist body joints (as in wearable devices), and not introduce other modes of forces or motion that might impede natural function.”\nIt’s also totally modular, so if you want fingers or an arm made out of them, that works, and a huge, horrible snake of them is an option too. (I’d prefer you didn’t.)\n“The full range of geometry and performance possible is still under investigation, but many other shapes have been tested in our lab, and the general idea is still open to many more,” wrote Paik. “Ultimately, this modular kit would be a household staple tool to automate objects or execute simple but diverse tasks (holding a nail while hammering, cleaning a refrigerator overnight, looking for lost objects around the house). Or it would be building blocks for an active wearable robots that can assist/give feedback to the user.”\nCurrently that testing is all manual — you have to assemble each piece and test it by hand — but the team is working on automated tools that could virtually assemble and test different configurations.\nThe downside of this technique is that, because vacuum pumps aren’t exactly lightweight or portable, the robot must remain tethered to one.\n“Pneumatic pumps have not been optimized for portability, since they are usually used in fixed settings,” Paik explained. “Hopefully these will improve as quickly as quadrotor technology has.”\nIt must be said that it’s not quite as sexy as a drone you can fly in your backyard, but if Paik and Robertson’s ideas pan out, this could be a precursor to a technology as ubiquitous as those drones.", "tags": "soft-robotics,epfl,robots", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/this-vacuum-activated-modular-robot-is-equally-nasty-and-neat/", "id": "1533380"}, {"title": "Google Assistant coming soon to more speakers, appliances and other devices", "text": "Google is hoping to catch up with Alexa’s reach by putting its Assistant on a wide range of third-party hardware.

According to the report, Apple is ditching the button to make room for a larger screen in one version of the next iPhone. Instead of a home button, users will perform actions using on-screen gesture controls involving a sort of dock of icons.\nIf true this would be the biggest change in iPhone design since the launch of the device in 2007.\nThe home button has been a staple in iPhone design since the beginning. It’s used to wake a device, return to the app grid, and, more recently, for Touch ID fingerprint recognition. All those tasks would be performed differently if removed. However, the Bloomberg report carefully states only the high-end version of the upcoming iPhone is losing the home button, which jibes with other rumors from the past few months.\nInstead of pressing a home button, users would interact with a thin software bar that can be moved around for different actions. Drag it to the middle of the screen to open the phone, or if in an app, activate the multitasking menu. Users can change apps or go back to the home screen, Bloomberg says. And it shouldn’t end there. If this report is true, Apple likely has cooked up all sorts of logical interactions for this software bar.\nApple has been foreshadowing the removal of the home button for some time. For the iPhone 7, it replaced the button with a non-moving version that simulated a click through with tactile response. The iPad also recently gained an app menu reminiscent of OS X’s dock. Bloomberg uses this as an illustration of the upcoming iPhone changes.\nThis is just part of what’s set to be a radical redesign of the next iPhone. Other rumors state the iPhone could mute notifications when you’re looking at it, include face scanning technology that works even when the phone is on the table, and include a screen that fills the frame of the phone except for a little notch that houses sensors, cameras, and earpiece.\nIt’s rumored that Apple is preparing to launch three versions of the next iPhone. It’s unlikely all versions will lose the home button for several reasons. The iPhone is Apple’s best-selling device and the removal of the home button is likely to be met with controversy. There’s no reason to rock the boat for everyone. Plus, the high-end version of the next iPhone will likely have much slimmer margins than an upgraded iPhone 7. Apple has long used incremental updates combined with bi-yearly design changes to keep margins healthy and it’s unlikely that will change.

But it’s with an easy conscience that I recommend Lomography’s new instant film camera; I backed the company’s last one, the Automat, and it’s been fantastic. This one looks similarly fun, and shoots in a larger format.\nThe Square has a funky folding-bellows design, which gives it a sort of Polaroid SX-70 vibe. It’s a good thing it folds, too, because otherwise the camera would be even more of a beast. The Automat focused on compactness, but it could do that because it shot on Instax Mini; I’ve grown to love the little ones but I can’t say I’d mind a little extra space to work with either. Moving up to the larger Instax Square means the camera has to be bigger in a few ways.\nNevertheless it’s a clever way to do it, this bellows system, which by the way Lomo assures potential buyers is made of a very tough rubber that won’t wear out or tear. The build quality on my Automat is great (much better than Lomo’s Diana F+ and instant back I have from a couple years back) so I’ll trust them on this.\nThese little instant cameras are super fun and everyone who sees them wants one — I say this from experience — but they’ll be satisfied with an instant photo of themselves doing something dumb. They always are.\nAnd if you’re worried about operating a film camera, don’t be — once you get a basic sense of the zone focusing (basically near, medium and far) you’re ready to shoot. There are advanced features like multiple and remote exposure, but 99 percent of my shots are just basic snaps. The photos themselves have that somehow endearing muted look, though unmixed primaries do pop.\nThere’s only one real caveat, which is that Instax Square is disproportionately expensive compared with Mini. A single cartridge holding 10 shots costs $14 on Amazon, while a twin pack (20 shots total) of Mini costs a little less than that, or even less if you just go in for a big pack of them. Not to mention Mini is available in many stores, while Square will be harder to find. So be ready to shell out a bit for the film and stock up when it’s on sale.\nThey’ve already doubled their goal so there’s no chance they don’t ship.

The company has been around since 2007, originally founded by Pat Phelan (who then went on to found an identity management company called Trustev, acquired by TransUnion).\nIt made a name for itself originally as a “virtual” mobile network provider that provided a solution for mobile users to make calls when travelling that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. (We also highlighted it back in the day at our first-ever Battlefield-style pitch event.)\nIn more recent years, though, roaming is something that regulators, carriers and app makers have worked on fixing for mobile consumers. In some regions you have roaming price caps; in others people buy “travel” packages ahead of their journeys; in other cases users simply opt to make calls via apps that bypass carrier call charges altogether.\nAnd so Cubic has shifted its focus to other “hardware”, like cars, that have their own sets of hurdles when it comes to global connectivity.\nAs Napier describes it, typically when automakers manufacture connected cars, they have to arrange network agreements with carriers in each country where those cars are rolled out into the market. Each deal comes with its own SIM (similar to phones), and its own associated labor, time and operational cost.\nCubic’s proposal is to solve that with a software-based solution using an eSIM (working with Valid, another strategic investor) that is pre-loaded into the car at the point of manufacture.\nThen, when the car is sold into one country or another, the car automatically links up to a local network to run its connected car services. That local network link-up is also part of Cubic’s offering: to date, it has mobile voice and data deals with 30 mobile operators covering over 180 countries.\n“We are pleased to strengthen our partnership by participating in this latest funding round, said Dr. Peter Steiner, managing director Audi Electronics Venture GmbH, in a statement. “By utilizing Cubic’s technology we are able to offer seamless Audi connect services to our customers in many countries all over the world without roaming costs and volume limitation.”\nThe company has been working with Audi — which is part of the Volkswagen Group, one of the biggest car makers in the world that also owns brands like Porsche, SEAT and Skoda — for some time already, and Napier said it is on track to have its tech in some 1 million cars.\n“Our ‘connected intelligence’ platform  has been growing between 23 percent to 25 percent every 55 days this year,” he said. “Our software has updated over 500,000 cars this year via OTA (over the Air) and we will hit over 1 million cars this year live.” In terms of active users, he said Cubic sees 600,000 unique automotive customers on its platform per month.\nOther OEMs that Cubic works with point to how it is also positioning itself in the larger IoT trend. They include HP, Lenovo, Panasonic, Rakuten and Woolworth’s.

But the end result is that employees could be presented with a confusing set of plans to pick from without a whole lot of guidance.\nThere’s where Lumity comes in. The startup looks to provide employers with tools that optimize health care costs and simplifies the approach to picking a healthcare plan for their employees. The end product is a screen with around four boxes that an employee can choose a health care plan, which makes sense as companies reach into the hundreds or thousands of employees and the process of signing on gets more and more complex. Lumity said today it raised $19 million in a financing round led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson to help build out efforts to attract customers, which already include Lyft and GoFundMe.\n“We take on primary employee support,” Lumity co-founder Tariq Hilaly said. “We deal with all employee questions, we deal with all the enrollment technology, and deal with all the data analytics. We put in place a set of plans that are better for the employees, and essentially reduce the cost of plans without compromising the benefits quality through using things like prescription data.”\nOne example is prescription data, which Lumity customers can voluntarily submit in order to help plan out their best health care plans. At first, Hilaly and the team weren’t 100% sure that employees would want to opt-in and share that data. But around 90% of the employees on the platform have actually opted into the service, which has given Lumity more data to chew on as it continues to refine its algorithms.\n\n“Data obviously has a flywheel attached to it,” Hilaly said. “The more you get, the better the models, and then the better the outcomes. We’re taking the benefits problem and applying both a technology and a service component. It involves interfacing with lots of different systems. I think that, certainly as the complexity and the breadth of what we do have expanded, the moat around it has expanded.”\nThe company last raised financing in September 2015, and since then, it’s continued to gather more data on its customer base. That’s a requirement for companies that look to predictive analytics to help manage risk and determine the best health care plans, especially in the face of a lot of potential competition from regional brokers that have a lot of experience and expertise. Lumity has to ensure that virtuous cycle — get more data, create a better experience, and then use that experience to convert new customers — continues if it’s going to stay alive.\nLumity’s pitch is that the company won’t necessarily lock you into a single platform. That’s part of the reason why Hilaly says companies would pick it over a product like Zenefits, which given that it targets the benefits space would likely be one of its strongest competitors. Zenefits, however, targets multiple different employment areas for companies — which makes sense for smaller companies but not necessarily as they grow into larger ones.\n“They’ve taken those three things, put them in a bundle, and probably for companies under 100 employees that might make sense,” Hilaly said. “In our market, it starts at around 100 and then goes up, people are less concerned about that all-in-one. They have different needs and systems. They might want ADP for payroll, for example. As they get larger, some may want to use Workday. We don’t focus on trying to build an all-in-one, we don’t focus on trying to lock you into our platform. We focus exclusively on benefits, that’s where you spend the most money.”", "tags": "health-care,benefits,lumity", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/lumity-raises-19m-to-simplify-employee-health-care-choices/", "id": "1530453"}, {"title": "Forward Networks nets $16M to help prevent network outages", "text": "As IP networks continue to grow and become ever more complex, and people become ever more dependent on them staying up all the time, a startup that is building software tools to help administrators keep networks running has landed a round of funding.\nForward Networks — a startup that only emerged from stealth last November and has built a platform aimed at service providers and enterprises to analyse their networks, identify problems that cause network outages and start fixing them — has picked up $16 million.\nCo-founded by four Stanford PhD’s who had done on other groundbreaking work in networking technologies, including pioneering efforts in software-defined networking (SDN), Forward Networks will use the funding to hire more engineers and expand its product features, said David Erickson, one of those four co-founders who is also the startup’s CEO (the other three co-founders are Nikhil Handigol, Brandon Heller and Peyman Kazemian).\nIts latest release, as it happens, is also being launched today in beta: Forward Essentials, a freemium product that lets network operators quickly access network state (the first step in identifying and repairing faults). It’s also adding support for VMware vSphere virtual networking on ESXi hosts to its list of supported networks.\nThis Series B round was led by DFJ, with participation from previous investors Andreessen Horowitz and A.Capital Ventures (the early stage fund that Ronny Conway left A16Z to create).\nMany of us remember the days of Twitter that were punctuated by the “fail whale” whenever the network went down. Today, Twitter’s network is a lot more robust, but that issue underscores a persistent problem in the digital world: network outages happen, and the reasons why are growing by the day.\n“David and his team have built a truly game-changing platform” said Andreas Stavropoulos, partner at DFJ, in a statement. “Modern enterprise networks are larger, more diverse and more fragile than ever before. Forward has taken a critical and significant step forward in how organizations manage their networks.”\nAt the same time, our reliance on networks continuing to stay up has grown massively: in business environments we need networks to be up to do any work at all, and in more consumer environments, we now use digital networks to run services in our house, to communicate and more.\nThe issue is that within the networking industry, most of products used to maintain networks are decades old and out of date.\n“In the last 20 years, the rate of complexity in network size, the number of protocols, the vendors [whose kit is in the network], and how all of those layer have all been increasing at nearly an exponential rate,” noted Erickson in an interview. “But the dollars into the operations space to continue to manage these has been nearly nonexistent. There has been a big pinch.”\nA lot of the responsibility for having everything work smoothly and avoiding outages falls to network operations teams, who take in tickets and issue fixes. They often use their own tools and legacy services like traceroutes to identify where traffic is going and where it’s coming from. But this process can be slow, and expensive, and not comprehensive enough. “The metric we use at Forward to figure out how effective we are is ‘how much time and money can we save everyone in the operations and security teams in their jobs?” Erickson said. “How many outages have there been and can we reduce the mean time to repair, or prevent them altogether?”\nThe idea behind what Forward Networks does is reminiscent of the application of big data that we are seeing in other parts of the tech world, this time applied specifically to networks: it identifies the myriad protocols, nodes, and systems that have been woven together in one complex network; it then creates maps of those networks, and builds behavioral models for how they work.\n“We then automate a huge amount of the work that goes into information collection and analysis, using mathematical algorithms that we built while still at Stanford,” Erickson said.\nAs you would expect, the company is not able to reveal a full list of its customers, but it notes a couple of biggies that point to what kinds of businesses are using it: DXC, the HP Enterprise and CSC merged IT services leviathan; and Telstra, the Australian incumbent telco.\nForward Networks is working in a fairly new area of the networking world — Erickson acknowledged to me when I asked about it that it can be a hard sell to some companies as a result, since it’s presenting a new product and solution that network operators have essentially been making do without for decades at this point.\nBut nonetheless, it’s an important area, and as a mark of how it may be heating up, there is another startup emerging that is a close competitor. Veriflow, also founded by university networking PhD’s, last year also announced its own raise of $11 million from an equally impressive set of backers: Menlo Ventures and NEA.\nStill, the investors in Forward believe that they’re betting on a strong horse, and that the field in any case is still wide open, with large enterprises, on average, experiencing at least five outages per month at a cost of $740,000 for each outage, according to Bill Krause, who is a board partner at Andreessen Horowitz.\n“We are very pleased to witness Forward Networks’ accomplishments. Three years ago we invested in the company because of the strength of the team, the differentiating technology, and the long-term vision of the company,” said Krause in a statment. “The company’s execution, vision and intense commitment to its customers is further proof that this was a smart investment.”\n“I am delighted to be part of the continued success of Forward Networks”, said Ronny Conway, founder and general partner at A.Capital, in a statement. “We saw the company’s potential and believed in their vision at an early stage. I am excited to see the next phase of the company’s growth that this new round of funding will accelerate”.\nToday’s Series B brings the total funding for Forward Networks to $27 million.

Mipsology, an FPGA-obsessed startup, has been working closely with Amazon to make the technology accessible over Amazon Web Services and other platforms.\nIf the last few decades were about creating generalized CPUs to handle a broad array of processes, the last few months have been about building custom chips that excel at specific tasks. A solid chunk of these efforts have gone toward dedicated chips for machine learning.\nThe most notable effort by far has been Google’s Tensor Processing Unit. The chips are optimized around TensorFlow, and early benchmarking completed has been very promising. That said, most major tech companies have side projects around the future of computing — quantum chips, FPGAs, etc. And when there’s interest from tech giants, startups are willing to make a game of it — Rigetti, Mythic and Wave to name a few.\nNo word on when Brainwave will be available for Microsoft Azure customers. As of now the system works with Google’s popular TensorFlow and Microsoft’s own CNTK. The company is setting ambitious expectations for deep learning performance using the technology, so there will undoubtedly be plenty more benchmarking news in the coming months.", "tags": "technology,computing", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/microsoft-brainwave-aims-to-accelerate-deep-learning-with-fpgas/", "id": "1529847"}, {"title": "Salesforce slides past its $10B annual run rate target", "text": "Earlier this year it looked as though Salesforce was starting to position itself as a company that would hit $10 billion in annual revenue run rate later this year — and, if all seems well, it looks like it may hit that target.\nSalesforce reported its second-quarter earnings today, saying it brought in $2.56 billion in revenue on earnings of 33 cents per share.

The new Chrome Enterprise subscription, which will cost $50 per device and year, is essentially a rebrand of Chrome Device Management, but with a number of additional capabilities. Even though the name would make you think this is about the Chrome browser, this program is actually all about Chrome OS. For Chrome users in the enterprise, Google already offers the Chrome Enterprise Bundle for IT, after all.\nFor enterprises, the main highlight here is that Chrome Enterprise is fully compatible with their existing on-premise Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure. Google senior director of product management for Android and Chrome for Business and Education Rajen Sheth told me that this has long been a stumbling block for many enterprises that were looking at adopting Chrome OS devices. With this update, enterprise users will be able to use their existing credentials to log into their Chrome OS devices and access their Google Cloud services — and IT admins will be able to manage their access to these devices and services.\nIt’s worth noting that Chrome OS admins could already enable other services that use the SAML standard to enable single sign-on for Chrome devices.\nIn addition, businesses also will now be able to manage their Chrome OS devices from the same enterprise mobility management solutions they already use, starting with VMware’s AirWatch. Support for similar services will launch in the future.\nWith this new licence, IT admins also will be able to set up a managed enterprise app store for their users. This feature is currently in beta and focuses on Chrome OS’s ability to run Android apps, which is currently available on many of the most popular Chrome devices in the enterprise.\nOther benefits of the Chrome Enterprise subscription include 24/7 enterprise support, managed OS updates and printer management (you may laugh about this last one, but that’s something that still matters in many offices).\nIt’s no secret that Google is working hard to get more enterprises to adopt its various cloud-based services. Chromebooks have already found a lucrative niche in verticals like retail and education. To expand its market share, though, features like this new integration with AirWatch were sorely needed.", "tags": "enterprise,chrome", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/google-launches-chrome-enterprise-for-businesses-that-want-to-use-chrome-os/", "id": "1529646"}, {"title": "Snap is in talks to buy Chinese selfie drone maker Zero Zero Robotics for $150M-$200M", "text": "It looks like Snap is enlisting outside help to advance its expansion into new hardware projects. The U.S. company is in talks with China-based drone maker Zero Zero Robotics over an acquisition, according to a source with knowledge of discussions.\nThe deal, which was first reported by The Information, is in the range of $150 million-$200 million, the source told TechCrunch. That price would represent quite an outlay, but Snap previously paid upwards of $250 million for social map company Zenly which is its most expensive acquisition to date. (Although Snap hasn’t confirmed its price for Zenly.)\nNeither Snap nor Zero Zero Robotics had returned our requests for comment at the time of writing.\nZero Zero Robotics is best known for its Hover Camera drone, which is designed for taking aerial selfies and was on display at our TechCrunch China event in Shanghai last year. The device launched to the public in October, it is sold exclusively by Apple for $500 via both its online and physical retail stores.\nWhen we first began to hear rumors that Zero Zero Robotics had been acquired by a “major U.S. company” earlier this summer, it was easy to assume that it had followed the fate of other drone companies in struggling to build a sustainable business and was seeking a soft landing. Most prominently, Lily, a Kickstarter success story, was forced to shutter earlier this year due to financial issues.\nSnap does have a track record in shopping for bargains among defunct drone companies. The fact that Lily had held unsuccessful acquisition talks with Snap as an alternative to closing and that Snap reportedly did acquire drone firm Ctrl Me Robotics, which was about to shut down, played into that theory. While increased competition from drone pioneer DJI, which announced its own take on Hover Camera, the $499 Spark drone, may well have put some heat on the Hover Camera.\nHowever, these negotiations are not driven by failure. Not only is Snap in talks to pay a lot more than the $25 million which Zero Zero Robotics has raised from investors to date, but, according to The Information, the Chinese company actually approached Snap over a potential investment — and that turned to a prospective acquisition.\nFor Snap, the deal makes sense as it looks to push its hardware business on from its Spectacles product. While another, more advanced iteration of the wearable camera glasses that could include augmented reality technology is currently under development, as TechCrunch recently reported, Snap has shown a desire to get into drones as part of its broadening focus on being a camera company.\nSnap once looked into developing its own drones in house, according to a New York Times report, but in the end it looks to have opted to lean on specialists outside of the company.\nSnap is under pressure from Wall Street to show growth, which could explain why it is prepared to pay a large sum to get a product that is already in the market.

The service is set to launch before the end of this year.\nLine has offered taxis in its homeland for two years, but it said that this new service is part of an expansion of Line’s year-old on-demand services platform, ‘Line Man,’ which currently spans food delivery, messenger/postal services, and more. Line is Thailand’s dominant chat app — the country is one of Line’s four largest markets in terms of users — and that’s undoubtedly why it is expanding into car bookings there before any other part of Southeast Asia.\nUber is under pressure to catch up with Grab across the region, and upstart Go-Jek in Indonesia, so a potentially popular new addition like Line isn’t exactly good news.\nLine Thailand said its new service was “developed in compliance with the Department of Land and Transport (DLT)’s regulations and Thai laws” — the legal status of Uber and Grab is somewhat grey in Thailand — which means that the service will work with licensed taxis. It has roped in the Bangkok Taxi Co-operative Network, which claims 60 percent of Bangkok’s 100,000 taxis as members.\n\nFor Line, this marks another move to diversify its business and widen its appeal to users. The company went public in a $1.1 billion US-Japan IPO last year, and most of its revenue is derived from its advertising business and in-app purchases within its social gaming apps.

We are trying to get a more specific number.\nFour-year-old Taxify is headquartered in Estonia — three of its founders are ex-Skype — and today it operates in 18 countries, including Hungary, Romania, South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya. While much of its business has been in emerging markets, the company is planning for an expansion to London later this year. Taxify claims 2.5 million users and its services span private cars and licensed taxis, which puts it squarely into the ‘Uber Rival’ box.\nThat’s a cause that Didi knows well — and is prone to putting money towards helping.\nAside from buying Uber China’s business to consolidate its dominant position at home, Didi has expanded its network with a series of global expansion partnerships. In addition to high-profile investments in Lyft, India’s Ola and Grab in Southeast Asia — the latter of which just landed $2 billion from Didi and SoftBank — it is in South America via a $100 million investment in Brazil’s 99.\nNow we can add Europe to that list because, interestingly, Didi hadn’t backed an Uber rival in the region until this news.\nDidi CEO Cheng Wei said that the investment, which includes a strategic partnership, will help link up transport services in Asia with those in Europe and Africa. Didi, which claims 400 million users across a variety of services in China, said it will help Taxify to grow its presence in its regions — where it claims to be second to Uber — and to develop smarter products.\nThe alliance will certainly be a boost since, unlike most others in the subsidization-heavy ride-hailing space, Taxify has raised a relative modest €2 million ($2.4 million) from investors to date.

In an era of uncertainty around the way traditional financial regulators will deal with the burst in alternative funding via ICOs, Singapore’s central bank’s move to tokenized its currency was seen as a positive validation by many in the crypto industry.\nIndeed, some consider Singapore to be an ‘ICO Haven’ — a Wired story in March stated that local regulators “do not consider this kind of digital token to be a security.”\nWell, that’s not quite true, it turns out. Today the MAS, Monetary Authority of Singapore, published a note to inform that it will regulate some (but seemingly not all) ICOs.\nThe takeaway from the six point bulletin is that MAS will regulate an ICO offering if it looks like a product that falls into Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act, i.e. if it behaves like a stock or any other security. MAS will also regulate exchanges and other services that enable post-ICO coin trading, the note said.\nIt all sounds simple enough, but the judge of what constitutes a ‘security’ is down to the regulator itself, and at this point it isn’t clear exactly what the considerations are.\nThe most pertinent piece of advice from MAS is an obvious one. Any company or individual considering an ICO that involves Singapore should “seek independent legal advice to ensure they comply with all applicable laws, and consult MAS where appropriate.”\nBeyond running an ICO for a business that is located in Singapore, MAS could also take interest in ICOs that accept money from buyers who are Singaporean or those who are based in the country.\nSo, far from doom and gloom, Singapore’s financial regulator has come out with an acknowledgement of the rise of ICOs in its domain and, by saying it will regulate certain offerings, it has eased some uncertainties around the legal status of this fast-growing fundraising option. Now we’ll have to wait to see which, or indeed whether any, upcoming ICOs fall into its securities basket and how they are dealt with.\nAlready the MAS disclosure has been welcomed by one industry body, ACCESS, which is comprised of representatives from Singapore’s cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.\n“ACCESS welcomes today’s statement from MAS. They recognize the wide variety of digital tokens available and that not all fall under the remit of the SFA. We appreciate their clarification and reiteration of their position on virtual currencies,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nMAS previously issued advice on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, which is used for ICOs, but it released this new note in response to the way crypto has evolved into a mechanism for raising funding.\n“MAS’ position of not regulating virtual currencies is similar to that of most jurisdictions.

But plenty of startup founders are still in the experimental phase of figuring out whether — or maybe how much  — machine learning can improve an existing app category.\nThe label that will probably end up being prefixed here is ‘smart’. Here’s one example: FitGenie, an iOS app whose ex-Georgia Tech co-founders bill it as a “smart calorie counter” — on account of applying machine learning algorithms to simplify nutrition planning for people wanting to achieve a certain weight or fitness goal.\n“Our self-adjusting diet algorithm is based on a model we created that maps and forecasts the progress of an individual user and makes intelligent weekly adjustments based on the data we gather,” says co-founder Keith Osayande, explaining how it’s applying AI to calorie counting.\n“This model is based on both [original co-founders’] our combined experiences as nutrition coaches and the most current scientific evidence we have available. Rather than just create a simple calorie calculator, we also process all of your data and take all aspects of dieting into account including, body composition, adherence, weight change rate trends, hunger, fatigue, and a handful of other metrics.”\n“The key thing to note is that we are not just gathering this data. Our algorithm is constantly assessing how these data points trend with each other and making informed adjustments,” he adds.\nNow it’s worth emphasizing that FitGenie’s app is still at an early stage, with the bootstrapping team starting work on their idea in fall 2015, when they were still students at Georgia Tech, and touting an impending 3.0 update — coming in the next “one to two months” — that aims to improve the polish and usability of their freemium offering.\nLast year the team took in $20,000 in funding from the Georgia Tech Create-X Startup Summer Program, and they now have some 21,000 users, a year after launch — generating early revenue from those choosing to pay the subscription to access premium features.\n“Currently… we’re focusing on the nutritional aspect of people’s journey into fitness,” says Osayande. “So it’s mainly focused on helping people lose weight, gain muscle mass or kind of maintain their current body with whatever physical activities that they’re doing.”\nThough he also notes there are obvious opportunities to integrate with fitness trackers down to line to automatically pull in relevant fitness data (vs asking people to manually input physical activity as the app currently does).\nFitGenie is aiming to stand out in a crowded space through “simplicity and automation”, says Osayande. So really its idea is that AI will be able to help users adhere to a diet and stay on track with their fitness goals by acting as a de facto pocket nutrition coach.\n“A lot of the [existing calorie counting] apps, they take in your data and they just give you graphs or pictures to look at — but they don’t do anything with your data,” he argues. “And that put a lot of strain on the user to actually have to understand their data and make adjustments on their own. But most people don’t have the training to do that and quite frankly don’t have the time or energy to put the effort in to learn that stuff — so we wanted to pretty much do all that for people.”\n“The top counters in the market are cluttered, ad-heavy, and difficult to use,” he continues. “Our algorithms emulate the major functions of a personal nutritionist to eliminate much of this guesswork, thus making dieting simpler and less time consuming.\n“So [users] can just enter their data, they don’t have to understand it, they don’t have to really know what they’re entering — just put what you’re eating, put your weight and then FitGenie does all the number crunching for you.”\nUsers of FitGenie do need to do some leg work, however — including inputting their current weight (ideally weekly), and logging the foods they’re eating and any activity they undertake (ideally doing so at least twice per week, says Osayande; more being better).\nThe app then generates custom daily nutrition targets, based on whatever a user’s desired fitness goal is — such as losing weight, building lean muscle and so on.\n“All of that is done by an [AI] model that we created in-house based off of [co-founder and chief adviser] Eric Helms’ research and then testing the algorithm when we were at Georgia Tech when we were at the barbell club,” he adds.\nThe paid version of the app include additional features, such as meal planning — with FitGenie currently drawing on a database of five million foods to generate its suggestions.\nHere it’s applying a genetic algorithm to “create an optimal meal plan that meets the user’s nutrition targets as well as their [dietary] preferences”, as Osayande put it.\nAlthough he also concedes that, currently, the app’s food database skews towards the co-founders own nutritional expertise — which means its assumption is users are meat eaters. So the team has a fair bit of work to do building out the database to ensure the meal planning feature can support users who are vegan or vegetarian, for instance, or who are trying to stick to a specific meat-eating diet such as paleo.\nAnother feature of the app aims to simplify sticking to a nutrition plan by keeping track of particular foodstuffs users have to hand, via a virtual in-app pantry, with the algorithm then adjusting its meal suggestions to take account of what they do or don’t have in the cupboard.\nAt this (still early) stage it’s fair to say there’s a lot more potential than perfect execution here — even as the team works on the touted polish coming down the pipe with v3.0.\nOne area where it can spectacularly fail to alleviate nutrition-related tedium right now is in its approach to food logging — with an over-reliance on scanning barcodes to log what you’re eating.\nSo while that might work fine if you’re always eating US pre-packaged meals and foodstuffs, anyone who falls outside that — say people who prefer to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients, or users outside the US — will find they have to manually create food items in the app, including inputting exact levels of nutrients (grams of protein, carbs, fat etc).\nThis gets very tedious very fast, with apparently no ability to search and select basic foodstuffs from a database to add their nutrient info. (Though there is at least a ‘quick add’ option which lets you create a food and just add a handful of the core nutrients vs the extensive list you have to fill in if you select to ‘create food’).\nFinding a way to improve or automate food logging would make for a much more compelling proposition. And indeed Osayande says the team is working on some ideas using either smartphone photos and even potentially Apple’s ARKit to automate this in a future version.\n“That’s still a little ways out and we’re still developing to see if we can either take pictures or scan people’s food to measure it that way — but we just got our hands on ARKit so we’re looking into that to see if that’s a possibility,” he adds.\nIn terms of rivals, existing players in the calorie counting space include apps like MyFitnessPal, Lifesum, LoseIt and Noom but Osayande names the closest competitor as another AI-applying automatic meal planner — called Eat This Much.\n“They also do meal plan recommendations through artificial intelligence but their web interface is better than their mobile app interface and they’re more of just a meal planner for a day — while ours is weekly, and they don’t really have an effective calorie counting aspect in their app,” he adds.", "tags": "ai,meal-planning,artificial-intelligence", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/fitgenie-is-applying-ai-to-automate-nutrition-planning/", "id": "1532917"}, {"title": "Tinder Gold, which lets you see who has liked you, launches today in U.S.", "text": "As Rafiki once said, “It is time.”\nTinder Gold, the dating app’s new premium subscription tier (which includes a feature that lets you see who’s already liked you without any swiping) is finally rolling out to the U.S.\nTinder Gold and Likes You were originally tested in Argentina, Australia, Canada and Mexico at the end of June. Today, however, the the feature rolls out to all Tinder users across the globe.\nOne of Tinder’s greatest obstacles has always been balancing the game of Tinder with the utility of Tinder. Those who were actually looking for a romantic endeavor were often inundated with matches that were simply swiping for the sake of swiping. In fact, before Likes You, the only way Tinder users had access to everyone that liked them was to swipe right on everyone.\nTinder’s Right Swipe Limiter worked well to curb that, but Likes You is a great way to make some cash on the back’s of users’ insatiable curiosity.\nThe company says that more than 1.6 billion swipes go down on Tinder each day around the world.\n“Some users have a lot of time to spend swiping and connecting with new people, but we’ve found that others want to maximize the time they’re able to spend on the app, and Likes You gives those users a way to swipe, match, and start chatting seamlessly,” said Tinder Chief Product Officer Brian Norgard. “Tinder Gold provides subscribers with the fun and engaging swiping experience they love about Tinder, coupled with the efficiency and control of being able to see who’s swiped right on them first.”\nTinder Gold includes many of the Tinder Plus features, such as Passport, Rewind, Unlimited Likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and other profile controls. And you can’t forget Likes You.\nTinder Gold pricing is still being tested, but the current price is $4.99/month.

The site started as something called The Stoner’s Cookbook before it was acquired and rebranded by Gray in 2015. Since then, the company has grown to 200 million video views per month, reaching 5.3 million unique viewers, according to Tubular Labs.\nAnd while Herb currently looks like a digital media business, Gray said, “We don’t see ourselves as just a website. We were always setting out to build a technology platform.”\nEventually, he wants Herb to become a site that you can visit for “everything cannabis-related,” including buying weed from local businesses and getting it delivered to your home in just a few minutes.\nGray compared the company to Uber and Airbnb, both in the sense that they’re an intermediary between consumers and service providers, and because they’ve had to fight some big legal battles along the way. He said Herb will respect local laws around cannabis sales, but at the same time, “I think these laws are changing — it’s about time. And as they change, Herb wants to be right there.”\nTo be clear, Herb is still a ways off from launching a marketplace business, but Gray said the site is adding new features that bring it closer to that goal, like creating detailed profiles of local dispensaries.\n“There’s a very real stigma that exists around cannabis today and our viewpoint on things here at Herb is that yesterday’s social stigmas become tomorrow’s social norms,” he added. “We’re trying to present the best face that we can for this industry and bring cannabis into the mainstream.”", "tags": "cannabis,marijuana,lerer-hippeau-ventures", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/herb-seed-funding/", "id": "1532661"}, {"title": "Michael Jordan funds mercenary dev hub Gigster’s $20M enterprise pivot", "text": "Gigster is shifting from letting anyone outsource full-stack app development to building next-gen tech projects for big companies. If an enterprise needs machine learning and vision, data visualization, blockchain, React or Swift work done and doesn’t want to hire full-time employees, Gigster assembles a squad of freelancers and guarantees the work at a fixed price.\nWith software eating everything, talent in high demand and tech rock stars seeking flexible schedules, Gigster is at the intersection of several massive trends. That’s why Redpoint is leading Gigster’s $20 million Series B joined by previous investor Andreessen Horowitz, and basketball legend Michael Jordan making one of his first tech investments. That brings the Gigster rocketship to $32.5 million in total funding just two years after launch.\n“Since the invention of computers, new technologies have made programming languages exponentially higher level,” Gigster co-founder Roger Dickey tells me. “These shifts, combined with the ‘future of work’ accelerants such as freelancing and AI, have changed software engineering dramatically and will continue to do so.”\n\nWhen Gigster raised its 2016 Series A, it had just three enterprise clients. Since then it’s scaled up to more than 40, with project size up 10X and revenue up 3.5X to the double-digit millions per year. That’s because enterprises can afford to shell out the big bucks for high-quality development. When budgets are tight with small-to-medium sized businesses, “we’re able to do a good job for the client, but not always as good as the client wants. It’s a bit of a mismatch,” co-founder Roger Dickey explains. “With enterprises, our satisfaction has been off the charts.” Revenue is up 2.5X year-over-year.\nGigster works with more than 1,000 top-of-the-line freelancers sourced from Stanford, MIT, Facebook and Google. They can earn bonuses through the Gigster Fund that pays freelancers part of the returns if projects it invests in successfully exit.\nGigster claims to have 93 percent client satisfaction, with 94 percent of projects within budget and 96 percent of milestones hit on schedule. Clients include Pepsi, Wyndam Hotels and MasterCard, as well as eBay, Square and OpenTable. They could struggle to recruit, or let Gigster take care of it. The startup plans to triple in size by hiring 120 more employees with the new funding.\n\nAt its core, Gigster is fusing teams of freelancers with advanced project management tools and artificial intelligence to ensure gigs get done on time and on budget. That’s a rarity in the tech world, where the joke is that you should double any estimate you’re given about how long it will take to design and code something.\nThe frustration of finding gifted but reliable freelancers is what led Dickey to found Gigster. After building hit social game Dope Wars, selling it to Zynga where it was turned into Mafia Wars and working there a few years, he wanted to experiment with some new projects. He started Gigster with co-founder Debo Olaosebikan to make it easy for anyone to pay to get software designed, coded and delivered. It competes with traditional hiring and freelance marketplaces like Toptal, where clients have to manage projects themselves, with Gigster emphasizing its turn-key service.\n\nTo fuel the enterprise pivot, Gigster raised the $20 million Series B from Redpoint, Andreessen and Jordan, as well as Y Combinator, Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Marc Benioff and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo. Dickey wouldn’t disclose the valuation but said “it was a substantial up round and we’re very pleased with the outcome.” Does Air Jordan bring any special skills to the cap table? Nope. “He was my childhood hero. It’s just fun to have him on the cap table,” Dickey laughs. “He didn’t put a ton into the round. We thought it’d be cool to have someone involved that we really look up to.”\nGigster already has luminary operators behind it, and chose Redpoint to lead the round because it’s a software-as-a-service expert. “We’re thinking of moving towards a SaaS model,” Dickey reveals. “It’s not going to happen immediately after the B round, but on top of selling [freelance development] services, we may sell some SaaS-based products as well.” He was cagey about what exactly those products would be, but they’d likely let enterprises use some of Gigster’s internal scoping and efficiency tools on their in-house projects.\n“There’s a new model in consulting, combining freelance talent with automation tools. That’s the reason Gigster exists,” Dickey tells me. “I think now is the right time to start this company as there’s structured data on work. Companies are leaving data in Asana, Trello, Slack . . . they’re leaving digital footprints. Our platform sucks out that structured data.”\n\nFor example, Gigster has mapped out 1,000 past projects to build a calculator that automatically processes time and budget proposals for potential clients. Its “Supervisor” tool knows how code check-ins and communication between engineers and the project manager should ramp up as a deadline approaches. “If you don’t see those actions happening, there’s a 91 percent chance you’re going to miss the milestone date,” Dickey says, which lets Gigster know when to step in to nudge freelancers or make changes.\nThese tools and more like its Team Builder, PM Assistant and Code Librarian could be invaluable to companies working on lots of projects, and give Gigster a SaaS-subscription revenue stream where it doesn’t have to pay out a big chunk to its freelancer teams. With all its new cash, Gigster can pay to build more SaaS tools, buy sales people to hock them and its freelancing service and add more fulfillment staff to the 15-person team that ensures gigs get done within the guaranteed schedule and budget.\nNot every company will be able to adapt to the software revolution on their own. And with advanced technologies like AI, blockchain and new mobile frameworks becoming more essential amidst a talent shortage, enterprises will need help.

These include Freightos, the well-funded freight marketplace and freight-forwarding quote price comparison site, and, more recently, Shipamax, which is trying to drag bulk shipping into the digital age.\nNow we can add BunkerEx to the list, a newly funded startup out of London that is building an online marketplace to change the way shipping companies buy fuel, or ‘bunkers,’ to use the correct industry term. In what is being described as a “pre-seed” round, the company has raised £400,000 from early-stage investor Seedcamp, and the taxpayer-funded London Co-Investment Fund, along with a number of unnamed angel investors.\n“I’ve been in the oil and shipping industry for nearly ten years now, most recently working four years at the largest bunker trader in the world,” BunkerEx co-founder and CEO Ishaan Hemnani tells TechCrunch. “That’s really where I learnt the ropes of this opaque industry and saw first-hand how a lack of transparency was significantly costing shipping companies”.\nTo put into context how opaque the buying and selling of bunkers is, Hemnani says that currently most shipping companies go to brokers to buy fuel for their ships in the same way you might use a mortgage or insurance broker, but with a key difference: the bunker market is entirely unregulated.\nThe result is that “brokers don’t choose vendors objectively but instead based on their own relationships,” meaning that although brokers should be acting in the interest of buyers (i.e. the shipping companies), they often give them a higher price in order to increase commissions.\n“Shipping companies never see the conversations between their broker and the supplier, and this ultimately costs them,” he says.\nTo address this, BunkerEx operates an online marketplace that matches supply and demand in a more direct way, bypassing traditional bunker brokers, even if in some says it also resembles one itself (the startup’s website even uses the tagline “The world’s most transparent bunker broker”).\nExplains Hemnani: “We’ve built a marketplace where buyers post their request on the site, and based on several parameters, such as the port, dates and fuel type, we show them a full list of our verified suppliers. They can then send the request to all suppliers in one click, who get invited into a live auction to openly compete for the deal. It’s like Alibaba for bunker fuel!”.\nAll offers are then transmitted in real-time, and once the buyer sees an offer they like, they accept it and the auction for that request ends. Noteworthy, suppliers are kept anonymous to each other and buyers can also give a counter price to all suppliers at once as leverage on a first to accept wins basis.\n“Besides the monetary benefits, there’s also a huge amount of time saved as a buyer can reach out to a large number of suppliers and fix a deal in minutes,” adds the BunkerEx CEO. “Traditionally this is all done over instant messenger (such as Skype Chat, although it used to be Yahoo! Messenger) so there is a lot of back-and-forth on different chat windows. We estimate that our platform saves a buyer an average of 40 minutes per deal”.\nMeanwhile, I’m told that a total of 400 million tonnes of fuel is delivered to ships every year, so BunkerEx is going after a potentially huge market. Repeat business shouldn’t be an issue either, with shippers typically needing to refuel vessels several times per week.\nAnd despite going up against traditional bunker brokers, Hemnani explains that BunkerEx hasn’t ditched an important element of what they offer, which is ensuring the quality and reliability of fuel suppliers. “Ultimately fuel is pumped onto a ship and a lot can go wrong with the delivery, so we still employ experts who are on call for our clients 24/7 to deal with any issues. That way we offer shipping companies all the benefits of using a broker, without having to pay the price for it,” he says.\nTo that end, BunkerEx says it charges a fixed commission to the supplier but doesn’t charge the buyer anything. Furthermore, that commission is said to be 80 per cent less than the fee a traditional bunker broker takes, with these savings returned back to the buyer. “Keep in mind that fuel makes up approximately 70 per cent of the cost of a voyage, so there’s a large incentive to reduce these costs,” adds Hemnani.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunkerex/", "id": "1532184"}, {"title": "Bunch wants to be ‘Google Analytics for company culture’", "text": "Bunch, a newly-launched startup operating out of Berlin, is aiming to be something akin to a “Google Analytics for company culture”. It offers a SaaS to let companies and company teams quantify internal company culture, and then use this data as the basis to screen job candidates to help ensure that they will also be a good fit.\nSpecifically, by mapping company culture data against that provided by a job applicant, the idea, Bunch founder and CEO Darja Gutnick tells me, is to be able to highlight any potential cultural fit issues that can be teased out during a subsequent interview. The software itself is based on the “organizational culture diagnosis” model developed by Charles O’Reilly from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.\nGutnick says that during her time as a researcher and consultant for “high-growth startups”, she realized that a strong company culture is at the core of every successful team. However, creating the right company culture starts with hiring the right people, but it is a challenge for many companies to figure out who really is a fit for their team. Evaluating candidates based on a CV and numerous rounds of interviews alone just doesn’t cut it.\nThe way Bunch works is as follows: A company signs to the Saas and its teams take a 5-minute culture assessment, based on the O’Reilly model. Then, using the data provided, Bunch creates a culture profile for the company and each of its teams, mapped onto 6 key dimensions: Results-orientation, Adaptability, Collaborative, Detail-orientation, Principles and Customer-orientation. Every new applicant is tasked with taking an automated culture quiz that Bunch checks against the team and company profile.\nUsing the resulting Bunch report, which details the candidate’s “behavioral tendencies” as well their potential fit with the company, the premise is that hiring managers can make more informed decisions but also use any conflicts as a jumping off point during a subsequent interview to really drill down into how well they integrate or what cultural value they could in fact add.\nFor example, someone very detailed oriented and rigid might not seem a fit for a fast-moving super early startup, but actually, within a particular team and by being aware of and talking through the potential conflict at interview, it could be the exact attribute a team needs. Or so the thinking goes.\nPut differently, Gutnick frames it as shifting the focus away from a candidate’s professional past and towards his/her present state of mind, team fit and work attitudes that impact present and future performance.\n“Team diversity in background, education and demographics is helpful and necessary, but when it comes to beliefs and attitudes, alignment is a key success factor resulting in 5x more annual revenue as opposed to companies that are not aligned. By measuring cultural alignment utilising multiple machine learning components, Bunch provides a solution that helps companies select candidates that fit the team, shape their culture early on when hiring and drive its success,” she says.", "tags": "google-analytics", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunch-ai/", "id": "1532350"}, {"title": "Western Digital acquires cloud services company Upthere", "text": "Western Digital has today announced that it purchased Upthere for an undisclosed amount.

It curates podcasts by subject matter for age ranges from three to 15 years old and packages them in a kid-friendly interface. Leela Kids gives caretakers peace of mind that whatever their charges are listening to is age-appropriate and reasonably edifying. In fact, it recently hit the top spot in the Taiwanese App Store’s kids category after parents started downloading it as an English-learning tool.\nNow also available for Android, Leela Kids was developed by Santa Clara, California-based Leela Labs, which launched last year to find better ways to find and listen to podcasts. Its main app, Leela, now hosts about four million episodes from across 30,000 podcasts, while Leela Kids currently hosts about 5,000 episodes from roughly 80 podcasts.\nLeela Labs founder and CEO Sandeep Jain said he became interested in podcasts after someone suggested an episode of A16Z while he was researching online marketplaces.\n“What struck me most was that despite living in the technology hub of the world, my information consumption resources had been limited to Google Search and certain print publications only,” Jain said in an email. “I had no idea that podcasts offered such amazing and relevant content and that I could consume this content while driving, at home, etc.”\nJain surveyed a group of tech-savvy friends and found that only two people out of 20 listened to podcasts.\n“I quickly found out why—technology to access them is horribly broken,” he said.\nDiscovering podcasts is a cumbersome process that involves figuring out the right keywords to search, subscribing to shows and then scrolling through a menu to find individual episodes to download. While Apple is trying to make podcast discovery easier, the current method is annoying enough to put off casual listeners and nearly impossible for younger kids to navigate.\nAfter realizing that even the grown-up version of Leela’s podcast player was hard for his four-year-old son to use, Jain decided to create a kids version. Leela Kids uses both tech and human curation to figure out which shows are best suited to specific ages, since that information usually isn’t included in a podcast’s RSS feed.\nParents might be incredulous that listening to audio content is enough to keep their kids engrossed when the wonders of Netflix, YouTube and Snapchat are just a click away on the same device. Jain says toddlers love listening to stories on the app, however, and that he has even managed to reduce his son’s screen time by playing podcasts during car trips and dinner. The startup plans to make Leela Kids compatible with smart speakers so older toddlers can operate the app themselves.\nParents of older kids, meanwhile, have told Jain that their offspring enjoy Leela Kids because it gives them a new way to discover content besides what they already read or watch.\n“Parents and even kids are liking the ‘visual detox’ effect of Leela Kids,” he said.\nThe Leela team did not anticipate that Leela Kids app would be used as a language learning tool until a Taiwanese news site recommended it.

The idea, co-founder and CEO Aditya Prakash says, is to flip the existing model where educational games often do a poor job of mimicking popular non-educational gaming titles. Thus, instead of gamifying existing learning content as it moves into the digital domain, Skidos wants to make it easier to put the learning content into casual gaming.\n“After launching our first in-house educational game in 2014, I quickly realised that making fun, high quality games was very time consuming and expensive,” he explains. “However at the same time, we had strong evidence that 5-12 year old kids really found the game engaging and useful to practice math. We used this evidence to pivot towards developing our proprietary SDK which can convert popular mobile games into fun educational games”.\nThe Skidos SDK, which is initially focusing on maths, soft launched at the Nordic Game conference in May 2016 where, Prakash says, the startup got a “phenomenal response” from game developers. The first version of the SDK was then given a more formal launch that August and since then Skidos has partnered with 10 international game studios and has launched 9 converted games on the App Stores.\n“If a pupil plays one of Skidos’ games for ten weeks or more, their accuracy level in math questions will, on average, go up by four percent besides increasing the time spent on practicing skills,” claims the Skidos founder.\nBut exactly how does the SDK let developers convert a casual game into a bona fide learning app?\nIn terms of the actual learning content, it has been designed as a replacement for worksheets and is mapped to popular maths curriculums. Specifically, once the game developer integrates the SDK, the learning content gets triggered at specific events when the child needs to advance in the game or win the virtual currency or special power up of the game — see the video embedded below.\nFrom a technical perspective, it’s offered as a Unity package file which has its own Graphical User Interface (GUI) and libraries which communicate with the Skidos servers.\nFor example, Prakash argues that a game like Super Mario can teach children mathematical concepts of speed, distance, time, costs, height etc because they engage with these concepts in the game. “We have created many such concepts around mathematics along with other standard mathematics curriculum inside the SDK,” he says.\n“There are companies who have tried to develop their own fun learning games but have failed to build a scalable business model,” adds Prakash. “At the same time, kids in the age group of 6-13 years are gamified since birth and spend an average of 2 hours daily playing casual games. We want to create learning opportunities for them during this time without compromising on gameplay or fun”.\nTo further that mission, Skidos has raised $750,000 in new funding.

It’s the company’s first foray in the States.\nPronto, the service that crashed and burned here over the last two years, used dedicated docks in various ostensibly high-traffic areas. This inconvenient model is one of several reasons it ended up shuttering in May — after being bailed out by the city last year, no less.\nThe new services follow the much better model of letting users pick up and drop off bikes anywhere. It’s already hugely popular in China, where Ofo recently raised $700 million to expand operations. Its rival, Mobike, had just raised $600 million — the latest, in both cases, of several rounds in the hundreds of millions.\nBike sharing, and indeed cycling in general, has never been quite as commonplace in the U.S., especially in Seattle, which, despite having a healthy outdoors culture, is simply not suited for casual biking. That said, it’s still a dense, growing and tech-savvy city that won’t dismiss this type of service out of hand. Car-sharing platforms like ReachNow and Car2Go have been embraced wholeheartedly.\nThe city just issued two permits for bike-share programs last month, one for San Francisco’s Spin and one for San Mateo’s LimeBike, and both now have wheels on the streets. I’ve noticed the orange (Spin) and green (LimeBike) bikes everywhere, and people are indeed using them.\nOfo will be the third to join in, and aims to have a thousand bikes in the city by the end of the month. Like the others, you’ll rent one by scanning the QR code on its back. A buck gets you an hour, although all the companies are exploring other models for frequent users.\nCurbed, which is keeping close tabs on the industry, got details on the actual bikes ahead of the official Thursday launch. They’ll have three gears, baskets up front and be more lightweight than those from rivals. That should help with Seattle’s many hills, and airless tires will prevent flats on our treacherous, pothole-filled streets. No helmets, though, which for casual riders are probably a good idea given how crowded our main thoroughfares are and how inattentive most drivers here are. Have I mentioned how unfriendly Seattle is to bikers?\nAll the bike-share companies are currently flouting Seattle’s helmet law, but it’s unlikely cops are going to give you a ticket unless you’re doing something really dumb. Yield to pedestrians, please!\nOf course, like Spin and LimeBike, there will be significant “rebalancing,” i.e. trucks carrying bikes up from the bottoms of hills and snatching them from the boonies. One feature I’d like to see is the idea of putting bounties on bikes near you that need to be moved to better locations. Why send a truck when you can pay someone nearby a quarter to roll it along a few blocks?\nWe’ll see how the current platforms pan out over the remainder of summer, but the true test will be fall. And winter. And spring. It rains a lot here and ridership will drop like a rock.", "tags": "mobike,seattle,bike-sharing,ofo", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/ofo-comes-to-the-us-joining-the-bike-share-fray-in-seattle/", "id": "1527677"}, {"title": "Apple could guide you around your city using augmented reality", "text": "ARKit is one of the biggest changes in iOS 11.

But some code tells you to tilt your phone in front of your face when you’re using walking directions.\nIn addition to that, it looks like the Maps app is going to use your phone cameras. That’s a lot of smoke for a feature that could ship with the iPhone 8. And when there’s smoke, Apple hides it:\nYou might remember Google’s Project Tango. Among other things, Google promised to use augmented reality to provide turn-by-turn directions inside museums, malls and more.\nApple already announced that it plans to add detailed maps of airports and malls in iOS 11. iOS 11 and the next iPhone are shipping in September. So I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple talked about some feature that lets you walk around an airport to find the nearest coffee shop using augmented reality.

It also has to refine its visual search product as more and more companies offer similar products, like Google (ironically also called Lens, the same name as Pinterest’s camera search product). As the company becomes increasingly focused on mobile and discovery centered around photos, users will start expecting the kinds of behaviors that exist on other services (like Instagram) to exist on Pinterest.\nOne of Pinterest’s core directives is to push people closer and closer toward a moment of inspiration where they act on some kind of idea they discover on Pinterest. That can include buying a product, downloading an app or even changing things in their closet based on something they see on Pinterest. If Pinterest is able to do that, it can go to advertisers and explain that it has a different kind of user behavior that they won’t find on Facebook or Snap — and get them to start spending a lot of money on Pinterest.\nZooming in on a photo to get a better look at something seems like a good feature for digging through cluttered photos in order to identify a product. Pinterest is giving users a way to take photos in order to search for products, but those kinds of amateur photos might not have the right products in focus. That might be especially true for rooms in homes and could hold true even for professional photos.\n\nThat might also help Pinterest fend off apps picking off certain use cases that the company has traditionally owned. Houzz, for example, is trying to become a go-to place for interior design and products you would buy for your home. That’s catapulted Houzz into a startup with a $4 billion valuation.\nPinterest is also making a small tweak to make the option to search visually on a Pin easier to find. All these kinds of tweaks may seem somewhat small. But the sum of these incremental changes may help Pinterest continue to show advertisers that it’s a company that deserves a big chunk of their ad budgets typically reserved for Google and Facebook. Pinterest recently raised capital at a $12.3 billion valuation, and if it’s going to justify that valuation it has to turn into a critical spend for marketers.", "tags": "pinterest,image-recognition", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/pinterest-users-can-now-pinch-to-zoom-on-photos-in-the-app/", "id": "1527585"}, {"title": "45 million people send birthday wishes on Facebook each day", "text": "Roughly 1 in 30 Facebook users tells someone Happy Birthday each day, showing Facebook’s first major emergent behavior is still going strong. Now Facebook is equipping the 45 million people sending birthday wishes each day with some new features.\nNow instead of just posting a soulless “HBD” or “Happy Birthday!” on someone’s wall with no personal message, photo, memory, or anything that makes it feel sincere, you can post one of Facebook’s auto-generated, personalized birthday videos. Similar to the ones it shows on your friendversary with different people, the birthday video will show photos of you and the birthday boy/girl with stylized transitions.\nThese videos could make it just as easy to send something that shows you and a friend’s unique journey through life together as it does to send a generic string of text. That could make sending birthday wishes feel more authentic and valuable, and less like a boring chore. Facebook launched birthday message recap videos last year to aggregate text wall posts from all your friends into something more visual, but now each friend can send a happy birthday video.\n\nAnd now when it’s your birthday, you can easily dedicate it to a charity. Two weeks before your birthday, you’ll get a prompt to choose from one of 750,000 eligible non-profits vetted by Facebook. Friends will get a notification about your fundraiser, and be able to donate on your behalf as a birthday gift.\nFacebook launched the donate button in 2013, and last year let people easily set up personal fundraisers. Facebook has received some flack for charging a 6.9% + $0.30 fee, but that covers processing, security, fraud, and vetting to ensure people are giving to real charities. Facebook has told me this is not a revenue generator, and in fact its fees are lower than what other donation platforms like GoFundMe charge.\n\nLast year Facebook said 100 million birthday wishes per day total. Birthday fundraisers could let people leverage the social obligation some users feel about sending birthday wishes, and turn that sentiment into actual good. It’s nice to see Facebook realize it’s created the “HBD” behavioral norm that wasn’t necessarily delivering much positive outcome or emotional resonance, and turn it into something more beneficial and nostalgia-inducing.", "tags": "facebook-birthday", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/facebook-birthday-video-fundraiser/", "id": "1527509"}, {"title": "Facebook and Instagram get redesigns for readability", "text": "Taking inspiration from line drawings, Reddit and Messenger, Facebook is overhauling the design of the News Feed to make it more legible, clickable and commentable. Specifically, Facebook now makes it much clearer where threads start and end in comments. Meanwhile, Instagram today got a little redesign itself with comment reels now being threaded so you can have sub-conversations in public.\n\nFacebook periodically updates its design, typically stripping out unnecessary “chrome,” or user interface framing, to create a sleeker, more readable look. There’s more and more white space on Facebook, which could be intended to reduce eye fatigue during long browsing sessions and let your friends’ content pop off the screen more vividly.\nFacebook’s design team writes “we did not want to just ‘fiddle at the edges’, but rather make something that billions of people use every day less frustrating.”\nBoth the Facebook and Instagram changes will roll out to all iOS and Android users over the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nFacebook is adopting the Messenger bubble style for comments. This will make threading more obvious, but also encourage the rapid-fire conversations people typically have in private messages. Facebook has been trying to make comments feel more alive recently with fast-moving conversations becoming their own chat windows.\n\nFacebook has made its navigation and feedback buttons bigger and easier to recognize with a new unfilled line drawing style. The News Feed, Video, Marketplace, Like, Comment and Share buttons now all feature this look. Meanwhile, Facebook is swapping the classic globe notifications icon for a more standard alerts bell. These could all be less distracting to the eye so you focus on Facebook’s content, not its chrome.\n\nOther redesigns for legibility include higher contrast text that’s easier to see and circular profile photos that take up less space and feel more human. Link previews are now a little bigger, too, which could get more people clicking and sending referral traffic to other sites. However, Facebook says today’s changes shouldn’t impact the reach or traffic of Pages. The URL domain is now more prominent, appearing above the link’s headline, which could reduce the likelihood that users click fake/hoax sites that mimic popular news publisher URLs.\n\nFacebook wants to make sure you don’t get lost several layers deep beyond the feed. Now you’ll see a more obvious header with a bigger black back button when you dive into a post from the News Feed. Facebook also says you’ll be able to “See where a link will take you before clicking on it,” though it already had link previews, blurbs and URLs, so we’ve asked for clarification here.\n\nAs Facebook and Instagram restyle themselves to boost usage, a question arises about design ethics. Is building a better mousetrap beneficial to society? Facebook and Instagram certainly allow communities and friend groups to grow their bonds, but when does fruitful exchange and sentimental entertainment give way to mindless scrolling?\nAs former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris discusses in his TED talk, over-optimization for engagement on social networks has created apps that are addictive to the point of being destructive.\n\nOver the years I’ve repeatedly asked Facebook’s top executives like CPO Chris Cox and VP of News Feed Adam Mosseri about whether the company is doing research into how to prevent or minimize internet addiction that can stem from Facebook’s ad-driven business model, and I’ve never gotten a direct answer that indicates they think it’s a priority.\nThey do care about their users’ experience, with Cox telling me “We’re getting to a size where it’s worth really taking a careful look at what are all the things that we can do to make social media the most positive force for good possible.” But you can always have too much of a good thing.\nThe execs tell me Facebook wants to make sure all your time spent on its apps is “meaningful”. Yet at some point when people are sitting in the dark alone refreshing the feed over and over, it could be worth surfacing Internet addiction and mental health tips, or encouraging them to connect directly with a friend via messaging.\nPerhaps one day our apps will be redesigned not just to soak up more attention, but to warn us when we’re neglecting everything else.", "tags": "facebook-messenger", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-instagram-comments/", "id": "1527216"}, {"title": "Facebook adds eBay’s Daily Deals to its Marketplace on mobile", "text": "Facebook is again getting into the daily deals space, this time in collaboration with eBay. The company has launched a new feature within its Marketplace section on its mobile app, where a selection of inventory from eBay’s Daily Deals program is now available. The deals can be shopped directly in Facebook’s app, but checkout takes place on eBay’s website through an in-app browser.\nThe new addition expands the focus for Marketplace, Facebook’s answer to Craigslist. This section today is prominently positioned in Facebook’s mobile app, occupying the central spot on the bottom bar on iOS (or top bar on Android), in between the Video and Notifications icons.\n\nLaunched publicly last fall, the idea has been to aggregate the “for sale” postings from the social network’s various “buy and sell” groups, allowing for an easier, more centralized way to search and shop for items from local sellers. You can also list your own items for sale, and chat with buyers or sellers via Marketplace’s integration with Messenger.\nTo date, however, it has been a peer-to-peer marketplace, not a source for deals from third-party websites, like eBay.\nThat has now changed, as some users will see a new “Daily Deals” section when clicking into Marketplace.\n\n \nThe deals will emphasize those products in the Consumer Electronics, Fashion, and Home & Garden categories.\nAt the top of the page, there’s a countdown that indicates how long the deals will be available. Each item also displays the percentage off. But to see the actual sale price, you have to click into the deal itself.\nThere will be around 100 new items posted to this section daily, we understand. Deals can be shared with others via SMS or Messenger, which will link to the deal via eBay’s ShopBot app.\nFacebook characterizes this as a test.\n“We’re conducting a test to determine if people are interested in shopping for discounted products when they visit Marketplace,” said Facebook Product Manager, Akash Anand, in a statement shared with TechCrunch.\nThe Daily Deals feature is currently available to a small percentage of people in the U.S. as of earlier this month, and is displaying on both the Android and iOS Facebook mobile apps.\n\nWhile eBay is the current source for these deals, Facebook’s arrangement with eBay is not exclusive. That means if this proves to be a popular feature, Facebook could expand Daily Deals to include those from other third parties as well.\nFor the time being, transaction revenue is not being shared between eBay and Facebook. Instead, users who click on a deal will be linked over to the eBay website within the Facebook app, where they can view more product details, and complete their purchase.\nDaily deals is an area Facebook explored years ago, during Groupon’s heyday. The idea back then was to connect users to deals for area restaurants, shops, group activities, and more, from local businesses. But these days, businesses that want to reach customers on Facebook set up their own Pages, and run ads. Plus, the can entice users with Facebook Offers, which can also be run as ads.\nThe new Daily Deals section, on the other hand, gives Facebook more of a “real” shopping feature – a way to browse products from eBay’s trusted sellers, then buy right in the Facebook app.\n\nThough a different angle on daily deals than before, it’s not the first time Facebook has dabbled with enabling commerce on its site. Most notably, the current “Shops” feature (originally called the “Shopping” feed) pulls in product listings from Facebook Pages, then lets you checkout from the seller’s own website, while still in Facebook.\nFacebook has not publicly announced the Daily Deals feature, as it remains a test. It’s not clear when or if the feature may become more broadly available, but we understand it’s not connected with the European Marketplace expansion news announced yesterday.\nEbay also confirmed the test of Daily Deals on Facebook.\n“At eBay, we are always looking to broaden our reach and surface inventory through new channels,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently running a test with a small subset of people on Facebook in the U.S. who can browse eBay’s Daily Deals on Facebook Marketplace.”", "tags": "e-commerce,facebook-marketplace,ebay", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/facebook-adds-ebays-daily-deals-to-its-marketplace-on-mobile/", "id": "1527155"}, {"title": "Facebook boosts snubbed Stories Camera with Live, GIF & text sharing", "text": "Despite the tepid reception for Facebook Stories, the social network is doubling down on its full-screen Camera feature.

Combining the Camera’s augmented reality face filters with Live could make people more comfortable broadcasting since they won’t have to show their real face.\nFacebook had already offered colored backgrounds for status updates through the traditional composer. It tested a GIF creator in Camera last month. And Facebook tested Live via Camera earlier this month, after allowing users to go Live from the News Feed composer since 2016. But now Facebook is officially rolling out these features to all iOS and Android users.\nFacebook globally launched Camera and 24-hour ephemeral Stories in March, declaring war on Snapchat directly after fighting by proxy via Instagram since last year.\nBut while Snapchat clones Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status have both surpassed the original to hit 250 million daily users, Facebook hasn’t given updates on how many people use its Camera and Stories. Critics in the West, where Snapchat and Instagram are popular, have dubbed Facebook Camera “redundant.” Some ask why we need multiple Facebook-owned properties to share the same Stories. Others find the Story bubbles atop the feed obtrusive, especially when people seem to be pouring very little content into the distribution channel. Right now only four of my friends have a Story posted.\nBut between Facebook’s launch of the augmented reality Camera Effects Platform in April and today’s addition of new features, Facebook seems hell-bent on making its Camera popular.

It was as a game developer that he said he first became frustrated with existing push notification tools — so Hiptic built its own system, which eventually became the company’s main focus.\nOneSignal is announcing today that it has raised $7 million in Series A.\nThe company also says it’s become “the most widely used push notification delivery platform on the internet today,” pointing to data from BuiltWith and AppFigures Explorer to show that its technology is used by more websites and apps than more established, better-funded competitors.\nOne of the reasons for OneSignal’s popularity is that it comes at the right price — it’s free for customers if they’re willing to share their interest and transaction data with large brands and advertisers, who can then use that data for better targeting. From a privacy perspective, Deglin said it’s similar to sharing user data with an ad network.\nThe “vast majority” of the more than 220,000 developers who use OneSignal are on the free version, Deglin added. He also argued that focusing on the free tier forced OneSignal to make the product easy to integrate and use: “The platform is open to so many people that we can’t count on having the resources to educate them on how to use every piece of the product.”\nOn the product side, OneSignal allows developers to run automated campaigns to re-engage users, with features like message localization, personalization and scheduling. Next up, Deglin said he wants to add support for other messaging channels — in fact, OneSignal has already integrated with Alexa notifications.\nThe new funding was led by SignalFire, with the firm’s co-founder and managing partner Ilya Kirnos joining OneSignal’s board of directors.\n“We started SignalFire to find companies like OneSignal that have huge traction and passionate customers,” Kirnos said in the announcement. “As soon as we discovered OneSignal, we knew we had to invest — they have the team, vision, and traction that few companies their size ever do.”\nOneSignal has now raised a total of $9.5 million.

The obvious comparison is Google Voice, but Barry Saik, GoDaddy’s senior vice president and general manager of telephony, said SmartLine is different because “the other products in our category are not as singularly focused on that small business owner.”\nSo there are some distinctions that may look relatively subtle, but which Saik said are important to GoDaddy customers, like showing both the caller ID (assuming they’re in your contacts) and the fact that a call is coming from SmartLine (so that you know it’s business-related) on the same screen.\n\nOther features include the ability to fully configure SmartLine from the mobile app (without visiting a website), to set business hours (so that calls outside of those hours go directly to voicemail) and to receive voicemail transcriptions.\nSaik also pointed out that the SmartLine app brings all your interactions with someone  — both voice and text — together in one window.\nAnd there are plans for more features, like vanity numbers, toll-free numbers and sharing a single phone number between multiple employees’ cell phones.\nA SmartLine with unlimited calling and texting costs $9.99 per month.

It can then lace together the different angles while keeping the song playing smoothly so you can choose where to watch from and see more than 10 seconds of footage in a row. You can see a demo recorded by TechCrunch below:\nhttps://youtu.be/xQkapLhuGV0\nSnap tested out Crowd Surf last night at pop singer Lorde’s performance at San Francisco’s Outside Lands music festival. When she played her hit “Green Light” and everyone thrusted their phones in the air, Snapchat combined the clips. You can watch the Crowd Surf in the Snapchat “Featured” section below your friends’ recent Stories, and tap to see a new angle whenever the flipping phone Crowd Surf icon is lit up.\nThe result is remarkably fun to watch. You can hop from the center of the crowd to the front row to the side stage to get an immersive look at what it was like to see the concert in person. In fact, I did see the show in person, but Crowd Surf lets me watch how everyone else was enjoying the same moment.\nSeveral now-defunct startups like Vyclone and CrowdSync have tried to build whole apps around the Crowd Surf idea, but most failed because they weren’t getting enough content submissions. Bolting the feature onto an already wildly popular app should prove more successful for Snapchat. The company pioneered the crowdsourced Our Story three years ago at the EDC music fest, and now it’s back pushing the bar higher.\nWhich begs the question…how long until Instagram Stories copies this? Both Snap and Instagram are in a heated war for users, with Snap inventing new features and Facebook’s giant Instagram team quickly cloning them to the detriment of Snap’s growth.\nEach wants to encourage users to submit their posts for public display. Snap lets you syndicate your post to Our Stories before you share it, which then appear in curated Our Stories, search results, and the new Snap Map. Instagram Story Search pulls together posts tagged with locations and hashtags for dedicated Stories about different places and topics.\nWe’ve asked Snapchat for more details on how Crowd Surf works. The company says it’s based on in-house AI technology and will roll out slowly to more events. Mashable spotted it this morning. Snapchat previously offered Story Explorer that let you check out similar Snaps to one you enjoyed during a Live Story by analyzing location and time, but not audio.\nCrowd Surf is set to be available at more public events in the future including concerts and speeches, but will require tons of people shooting and submitting Snaps from the same moment. That could limit it to huge events like music festivals, though perhaps it could work for parades, sports events, or political rallies too. And the mere existence of the feature could attract more submissions.\nIf people think their Snaps could get chosen for Crowd Surfs and get extra viewers, they might be more likely to shoot and share on Snapchat when they’re watching a concert.", "tags": "snapchat-clone", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/snapchat-crowd-surf/", "id": "1526828"}, {"title": "Facebook is rolling out a Trending News section on mobile, now with its own link", "text": "Facebook is rolling out a “Trending News” section on mobile that includes its own link in the app’s main navigation. This follows the company’s earlier announcement this spring of a redesign for Trending Topics, an increasingly important part of Facebook’s social network, where it tracks the news stories that are buzzing across its service. That redesign is now rolling out to users on iPhone and Android devices in the U.S., while the added navigational link to Trending News became available on iPhone over the past few weeks, and is in testing on Android, Facebook tells us.\n\nIn case you missed Facebook’s announcement in May, the Trending Topics section was redesigned with a focus on making it easier to see how other publications are covering a topic, in addition to what friends and public figures are saying about the matter.\nWhen you click into a Trending Topic following the update, Facebook explained you will see a carousel of stories from other publications that you swipe through horizontally.\n\nThe publications linked to in this section are determined by engagement around both the article and publisher in general on Facebook, as well as what other articles are linking to it.\nThis card-style carousel look-and-feel was inspired in part by Facebook Paper, the company’s long since shuttered standalone news reading app.\nThis carousel is still in the process of rolling out across the U.S.\nHowever, one aspect to Trending’s makeover that wasn’t really touched on during Facebook’s earlier announcement was how Facebook was toying with a redesigned list of news stories that focused on headlines, not just “trending topics.”\nThe original look for Facebook’s Trending Topics – which you pull up with a tap into the app’s search box – is a simple list of topics and the beginning of a lede that’s usually cut off. These appear below your own recent Facebook searches in the app.\nHowever, if you access the new Trending News link that’s just popped up in Facebook’s navigation menu, you’ll see an entirely different sort of Trending section.\n\nAbove: Old Trending on left vs New Trending on right\nInstead of a “topic” (often just a word, person or place, like “China” or “Donald Trump”) and squiggly arrow icon, the news stories here include a headline, a photo, the name of a major media outlet that’s reporting it, and how many other sources are available on the topic.\nFor example, next to the headline, it might say: “Reuters and 100+ other sources.”\nPlus, by adding the photo next to each item, there’s more room for expanded information – that is, a full headline and sourcing.\nThe new section also gives stories a rank (#1, #2, #3,…etc.)\nFacebook’s prior announcement in May didn’t specifically detail how this Trending News section looked different from Trending Topics.\nFrankly, it’s all a bit confusing, because Trending Topics and Trending News don’t seem to be tied directly together at this point. For example, you could have the link to Trending News in your app’s main navigation, but still not have the new look for Trending Topics, which includes the carousel redesign.\nHowever, in that same post, we did get a little peek at Trending News – but it was referenced as being a part of a “small test.”\n\nTrending integration in News Feed still a “small test”\nFacebook said then it was testing adding the top three Trending News stories to users’ News Feeds. In a screenshot of this, you were able see this list of stories with photos that were ranked by numbers, as well as stories identified by headlines instead of just “topics.”\nThis integration of a “mini” Trending News section into News Feed is not broadly available. That remains a “small test,” we understand.\nBut the addition of the Trending News link to Facebook’s navigation is already live on iPhone, and being trialed on Android.\nOf course, any changes Facebook makes to Trending are sure to met with a lot of scrutiny.

That means more people around the world will gain the ability to search the web by voice as well as type via voice using Google’s keyboard app, Gboard.\nThe company says with the update, it’s adding 30 languages and locales around the world, bringing the total supported to 119. The update includes 8 more Indian languages, as well as Swahili and Amharic, two of Africa’s largest languages.\nThe new speech recognition will be initially supported in Gboard for Android and Voice Search. U.S. English speakers, meanwhile, can now use voice dictation to express themselves using emojis, too. (e.g. you can just say “winky face emoji” instead of hunting for it.)\nThe new languages are also available today in the Cloud Speech API, which already supported 89 languages, and is used in a number of third-party voice and video applications, like transcription services, speech analytics applications, IVR applications, and more.\nIn time, the new languages will be added to other Google products, including the Google Translate app.\n\nHowever, the more critical part of this news is what this means for those in emerging markets – regions that are often ignored when it comes to being among the first to gain access to new technology advances from tech giants.\nBut with mobile, that’s changed. Tech companies are now aiming to establish footholds in these regions, as the next large swath of internet users come online.\nIn India, especially, Google’s move to expand speech recognition tech could have a significant impact. The country is estimated to have some 420 million mobile internet users as of this June, making India one of the biggest markets in the world for companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to address.\nGoogle’s expansion with voice technology also comes shortly after a piece in The Wall Street Journal detailed how tech companies are rethinking their products for the developing world – in particular, how the next billion mobile users will heavily take advantage of technologies like video and voice. Google, for example, told The WSJ, that it’s been seeing “a new kind of internet user” – a group that’s “very different from the first billion” in terms of how they access the web.\nTo develop speech recognition capabilities for these new languages, Google combined human labor with its machine learning technology.\nThe company says that it works with native speakers to collect speech samples by asking them to read common phrases. This, in turn, helped to train Google’s machine learning models to better understand the sounds and words of the new languages to improve their accuracy when they were exposed to more examples over time.\nThe full list of new languages includes the following:", "tags": "machine-learning,speech-recognition,voice", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/googles-voice-typing-tech-adds-support-for-30-more-languages-reaching-further-into-africa-india/", "id": "1526593"}, {"title": "Snap sold fewer than 42K Spectacles, down 35% in Q2", "text": "Snap’s Spectacles sunglasses may prove to be more of a fad than a must-have device.

That’s compared to $8.3 million in Other revenue in Q1, or fewer than 64,000 pairs, meaning Spectacles sales have declined roughly 35 percent.\nSnap recently began selling Spectacles on Amazon and in other companies’ retail stores, like Harrod’s, but those sales won’t show up til Q3 earnings. Snap did start selling Spectacles online and through its Snapbot vending machines in Europe for the first time back in June. That means the 41,500 number may have been propped up by this expansion, and sales in the U.S. may have slipped further.\n\nSnap may either need a radically different, AR-equipped version 2 of Spectacles to reinvigorate interest, or it may need to look to other cameras to sell. It recently acquired Zero Robotics, a Chinese maker of the Hover selfie drone, for between $150 million and $200 million. Sources told TechCrunch today that the deal is complete.

The stumbling music streaming community site had to suddenly lay off 40 percent of its staff last month. Now it’s asking investors for $169.5 million at a pre-money enterprise valuation of just $150 million, according to Axios‘ reliable business editor Dan Primack. That’s a steep drop from the $700 million valuation of its previous rounds.\nIf SoundCloud doesn’t get the funding, CEO Alexander Ljung reportedly told investors that SoundCloud won’t be able “to continue as a going concern.” That could force SoundCloud to sell even though Ljung has stubbornly fought to keep the dying startup independent. If it can’t find funding or a buyer, SoundCloud could vaporize, destroying its massive archive of user-uploaded music, podcasts and other sounds.\nInvestors would be forgiven their distrust since SoundCloud has burned over $230 million in funding plus $70 million in debt with little monetization progress to show for it.\n[Update: At least this new funding deal would bring in new management. Recode reports that former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor would replace SoundCloud CEO Alex Ljung if investors do provide the funding.]\n\nLast month we detailed the many, MANY problems with SoundCloud. Employees told us the company is “a shitshow,” with a lack of product direction, talent leaving and employees secretly using Spotify.\nRather than focus on its unique value proposition of being the “YouTube for Audio” with demos, DJ sets and remixes available nowhere else, SoundCloud chased dreams of grandeur as it tried to evolve into a Spotify competitor. But after taking years to negotiate deals with the major record labels, the extremely late $9.99 SoundCloud Go+ subscription service flopped. Meanwhile, it had burned credibility with core users like DJs by removing their music over dubious copyright claims while trying to suck up to the labels.\nSoundCloud lavishly spent money on offices around the world while its CEO galavanted at music festivals like a rock star. SoundCloud recklessly wasted money, hiring people up until the moment it announced they’d be immediately let go as part of the 173 layoffs it announced last month. Now staff morale is in the toilet, the user experience is a mess, the subscription models are unappealing, competitors are growing rapidly and musicians are fleeing to other upload platforms.\nThat’s why it seems crazy for investors to fund a $170 million Series F to keep a sinking ship afloat a little longer unless SoundCloud is willing to swallow its pride and get acquired for whatever it can get.\nThe new investors would be Raine Group and Temasek, plus existing backers Union Square Ventures, Doughty Hanson and Atlantic Technology. They’d at least get preferred stock that’s paid out upon exit before previous investors. But how are they to know they won’t get diluted too when SoundCloud runs out of money again? The new deal would reportedly reduce the liquidity preference of the previous Series E investors by over 40 percent.\nWe reached out to SoundCloud PR and its CEO for comment or clarity on the do-or-die fundraise, but didn’t hear back.\nInvestors’ best bet is to fund a small bridge round just big enough for SoundCloud to shop itself around and find a buyer. Perhaps Google would buy it to align the YouTube of Audio with the YouTube of YouTube. Or Amazon could step in and try to do for musicians what it did for book authors by creating a convenient aggregated marketplace, though acquiring Pandora might better mesh with Amazon’s mainstream demographic.\nSoundCloud has proven it can’t manage itself. It’s too damaged, too in debt and too far behind to thrive independently without a miracle turnaround. No matter what, the whole service is on shaky footing, so musicians may want to archive their audio and start promoting their presence somewhere safer.", "tags": "alex-ljung,soundcloud", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/soundcloud-shut-down-possible/", "id": "1525623"}, {"title": "Blue Apron is having a really bad day", "text": "Things are not going so well for Blue Apron this morning after reporting its second-quarter earnings (its first earnings report ever), and the stock is crashing as a result of it.\nThe company’s stock is down more than 14 percent on the earnings report, which came in pretty mixed compared to what Wall Street wanted. Blue Apron is looking to pull back on its marketing spend as it tries to get its burn under control, which resulted in a drop in its number of customers. The company was able to squeeze out a small profit in a past life, but since then it began to aggressively spend on marketing as it sought to acquire customers.\nThe problem quickly became getting those customers to stick around and keep buying meals. This time around, the company was able to improve the health of its customer base as they are spending more money and buying slightly more meals, but it still has to show that it can grow that base even as it starts to pull back on marketing. The company reported a loss of 47 cents per share on revenue of $238.1 million, while Wall Street was looking for a loss of 30 cents per share on $235.8 million.\nChart time:\n\nSo, better than expected revenue but with a widening loss even, as it pares back its marketing expense. The company gave off some negative signals about its next quarter, forecasting a loss between $121 million and $128 million in the second half, according to Business Insider. These comments were likely made on the earnings call, which we’re reviewing right now. But those kinds of negative signals are going to punish a freshly-IPO’d company, especially amid a period of wild uncertainty with the decline of Snap and possible fading appetite for new IPOs.\nIf Blue Apron sees some turbulence heading into the back half of the year, the persistent threat of Amazon definitely isn’t going to help. Information is slowly dripping out that Amazon is gunning for the meal-kit delivery space, which has crushed the stock over time. The company went public at $10 per share, but has since collapsed and lost nearly half its value.\nStill, the IPOs will continue to come.

Plus, Snapchat could use some brand juice, and Pokémon and Pikachu have proven to offer that for a lot of other platforms, including any of Nintendo’s hardware consoles and even AR via Pokémon Go.\nSnapchat’s Pikachu filter is a limited run option, so if you want to capture yourself looking like Ash’s best pal you’d better get on it.

After pricing its IPO at $17 and then reaching highs of $27, the company has fallen to less than half that. After losing 14 percent of its value in a single day’s trading, Snap closed Friday at $11.83.\nThe growing social media company revealed on Thursday that it has 173 million daily active users, up more than 20 percent since last year. But that wasn’t enough to impress Wall Street, which was expecting more than 175 million users.\nAnalyst expectations are always built into the stock price and missing them will cause shares to plummet. And Snap not only missed on user growth, but revenue and losses, as well. \nThe company brought in $181.7 million in revenue, a 153 percent increase from last year, but investors were expecting more than $186 million. But losses also increased substantially, $115.9 million for last year’s quarter versus $443.1 million for this year.\nThe success of Instagram Stories is one of the main reasons that investors are skeptical of Snap. Instagram copied its short-form video feature last year and has seen tremendous success. The Stories feature already has 250 million daily users, over 75 million more than Snap.\nSnap also recently found out that it won’t be in the S&P 500, which is a significant blow because a lot of investors buy that index.

CEO Alex Ljung will step aside though remain chairman as former Vimeo CEO Kerry Trainor replaces him. Mike Weissman will become COO as SoundCloud co-founder and CTO Eric Wahlforss stays as chief product officer. New York investment bank Raine Group and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek have stepped in to lead the new Series F funding round of $169.5 million.\nSoundCloud laid off 40 percent of its staff last month, with 173 employees departing in an effort to cut costs. The company only had enough runway left to last into Q4, and today's investor decision was viewed as a do-or-die moment for the company. Now it will have the opportunity to try to right the ship, or sail into an established port via acquisition.\nSoundCloud declined to share the valuation or quantity of the new funding round. Yesterday, Axios reported the company was raising $169.5 million at a $150 million pre-money valuation. That's a steep decline in value from the $700 million it was valued at in previous funding rounds. The new Series F round supposedly gives Raine and Temasek liquidation preferences that override all previous investors, and the Series E investors are getting their preferences reduced by 40 percent. They're surely not happy about that, but it's better than their investment vaporizing.\nRaine will get two board seats for bailing out SoundCloud, with partner and former music industry attorney Fred Davis, and the vice president who leads music investments, Joe Puthenveetil, taking those seats.\nWhile abdicating the CEO role probably wasn't exactly what Ljung had hoped for, at least he gets to stay on with the company as chairman of the board. \"This financing means SoundCloud remains strong, independent and here to stay,\" he wrote.\n\n\nSoundCloud says its total revenue is now at a $100 million annual run-rate. If it can keep costs low and grow that number, it may eventually get to break even and no longer need infusions of investor capital.\nTechCrunch broke news about the magnitude of the SoundCloud crisis last month. Sources from the company told us the layoffs had been planned for months, but SoundCloud still recklessly hired employees up until the last minute, with some being let go within weeks of starting. Employees told TechCrunch that the company was \"a shitshow\" with inconsistent product direction and dwindling cash. Ljung was seen as reluctant to be honest with the team, and unfocused as he partied around the world like a rock star.\nOur report led to a flurry of follow-on coverage, prompting fans and artists to speak up in favor of the service. The rally was reminiscent of the love shown to Vine after Twitter announced it would shut down. Popular musician Chance The Rapper tried to get involved to save the company. He, like many other indie hip-hop artists, made their name on the platform as part of a genre that came to be called \"SoundCloud Rap.\" In the end, SoundCloud was saved when Vine wasn't.\nFor now, music and other audio saved on SoundCloud is safe. But the company will need to find a way to make its subscription tiers more appealing and scale up its advertising despite having much less staff to drive the changes. If it can't, SoundCloud could be back begging for cash in a year.\nThe new management should provide some additional confidence. I've interviewed both Ljung and Wahlforss in the past, and neither had answers to the big questions facing SoundCloud about its product direction, business model and the spurious copyright takedowns that have eroded its trust with musicians.\nTrainor may be able to institute some more discipline at the startup. He was the CEO of Vimeo from 2012 to 2016, and has poached his former COO there to help run SoundCloud. They helped Vimeo fend off bigger rivals like YouTube by doubling down on what was special about the service: a focus on high-quality artful film rather than amateur viral videos. That experience makes Trainor a great fit to lead SoundCloud, which is fending off bigger rivals like Spotify and Apple Music.\nSoundCloud's best bet isn't to battle them directly, but double down on the user-uploaded indie music scene, including garage demos, DJ sets, unofficial remixes and miscellaneous audio you can't find elsewhere. Whether it stays independent long term or tries to seduce an acquirer, SoundCloud will benefit from spotlighting its unique community of creators and hardcore listeners.", "tags": "soundcloud,streaming-music", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/soundcloud-saved/", "id": "1526192"}, {"title": "Discord steals gamers from Skype with video chat and screensharing", "text": "Discord wants to destroy its biggest, best-funded competitor in the battle to be the communications layer for gaming. It wants to be the home for gamer clans strategizing and trash-talking with each other. After out-gunning its gaming-specific competitors like TeamSpeak, Mumble and Ventrilo with a secret $50 million fundraise earlier this year, Discord is setting its sights on Skype.\nToday Discord expands beyond text and voice with the launch of video chat and screensharing. Now friends can watch each other play their favorite games while talking face-to-face. These features could further addict Discord’s 45 million users, 9 million of whom use its web, desktop and mobile apps each day.\n\n“This is the most requested feature on Discord probably a year running,” says CMO Eros Resmini. “A lot of infrastructure had to be built up for this launch,” he warns, though, since the video features run at a remarkably smooth and crisp 720p at 30 frames per second. Skype runs at half that FPS. My briefing with the company was held over its new video chat, and it looked much better than what’s standard.\nThat’s why only 5 percent of users will get video today, and it will only work with groups of up to 10 people. Embodying Discord’s playful style, the company explains that “It’s possible that we’ll need to completely turn off video calls during this test. If you find the feature is missing all of a sudden, we suggest you lay on the floor and stare at the ceiling until it’s fixed.”\nIf the video launch goes smoothly, Discord could snatch gamers from its competitors that either lack video entirely, or do screensharing poorly like Skype, as they weren’t built for conveying rapid-fire action with sharp graphics. One big thing that’s lacking is sound from screenshares, which Discord will need to figure out.\nVideo chat could be a stepping stone for Discord to start competing with massive one-to-many broadcasting channels like YouTube and Twitch.\n\nDiscord was originally a game developer itself, making the critically acclaimed but publicly ignored mobile battle arena Fates Forever. “We couldn’t figure out how to get over the hump on the monetization side,” Resmini says. So in late 2014, it started tinkering with other ideas.\nCTO Stan Vishnevskiy had been dreaming of a tool like Discord. “I played MMORPG [Massively multiplayer online role-playing games] 15 hours per day,” he told me, and was dissatisfied with TeamSpeak and Mumble. Those required IP addresses that could be attacked by trolls, rented servers and clumsy apps. “Can we make a 10X project? Low-friction usage, no renting servers, beautiful design we took from mobile.”\nDiscord launched in May 2016 and has been a rocket ship ever since. It’s now raised a total of $79 million, including the $50 million round led by Index Ventures in January 2017. The 70-employee startup now handles 200 million messages per day and up to 4 million concurrent users as groups chat about World of Warcraft, OverWatch, League of Legends and Clash Royale.\nThe startup earns money from $5/month subscriptions to its Nitro tier, which gives users cosmetic upgrades and a few bells and whistles. “Discord has made the promise to our user base of keeping the core Discord experience free,” says Resmini. But the company is considering launching in-app purchases to enhance the new video features and earn some extra cash.\n\nThe company insists that the majority of its users are gamers chatting with small groups of friends, where someone calling someone else a colorful, profanity-laced name is more a joke than a harassment issue. But there are some larger public servers for entire sub-Reddits where people discuss topics beyond games, and Discord has unfortunately found itself used by hate groups to coordinate trolling and harassment.\n“We focus on giving people tools and controls so they never get in a situation that they’re with a stranger that’s doing something you don’t think is OK,” says Resmini. “You can block folks, you can leave places, you can remain in a private space.” The team also relies on users to report abuse to its team trained to quickly banish harassment, doxing and other problems.\nSome startups, like subscription crowdfunding platform Patreon, have taken a relatively permissive approach to dealing with hate-mongers, and decline to comment on incendiary topics like Gamergate. That’s why it was encouraging to hear Discord speak candidly about its disapproval of the alt-right and sexism in the gaming business.\n“Their ideologies aren’t welcome,” Resmini declares. “We don’t like people that act that way, people that harass people. We’re on the side of gaming that’s a positive community. That’s an inclusive community.”\n\nStill, Discord won’t proactively jump in unless there are abuse reports. “We don’t read people’s private servers. We believe in privacy at Discord. The censorship thing is something we’ve stayed away from. We think it’s a very slippery slope,” Resmini admits. But once hatred surfaces, it’s comfortable dealing out lifetime bans and deletions of servers.\nIf Discord ever wants to become a mainstream communication tool for gaming culture that’s grown increasingly popular worldwide, it has to keep things clean and friendly, even if that means friends laughing while they swear at each other. “Some of the happiest times of my life have come from gaming,” Vishnevskiy concludes. “And things that make me happy, I want to bring to others.”", "tags": "teamspeak,video-games,discord", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/discord-video/", "id": "1525626"}, {"title": "Facebook launches Watch tab of original video shows", "text": "Facebook has a new home for original video content produced exclusively for it by partners, who will earn 55 percent of ad break revenue while Facebook keeps 45 percent. The “Watch” tab and several dozen original shows will start rolling out  to a small group of U.S. users tomorrow on mobile, desktop and Facebook’s TV apps.\nBy hosting original programming, Facebook could boost ad revenue and give people a reason to frequently return to the News Feed for content they can’t get anywhere else.\nWatch features personalized recommendations of live and recorded shows to watch, plus categories like “Most Talked About,” “What’s Making People Laugh” and “Shows Your Friends Are Watching.” Publishers can also share their shows to the News Feed to help people discover them. A Watchlist feature lets you subscribe to updates on new episodes of your favorite shows. Fans can connect with each other and creators through a new feature that links shows to Groups.\n\nFacebook says it plans to roll out access to Watch to more users and more content creators soon, starting with the rest of the U.S. before expanding internationally. Users with access will see a TV-shaped Watch button in the bottom navigation bar of Facebook’s main app that opens the new video hub.\nFacebook admits that “we’ve also funded some shows” as examples, but notes that these are only a small percentage of all the available shows. “We want any publisher/creator who is interested to be able to create a show in the future,” a Facebook spokesperson tells me. “So there will be hundreds of shows at launch, and we’ll hopefully scale to thousands.”\nBusiness Insider reported some leaked details about the redesign earlier today, but pegged the launch of original programming as starting August 28th, when the shows actually will begin to roll out tomorrow.\nFacebook’s shows will run the gamut from live event coverage to reality TV to scripted programs.  “More and more people are coming to Facebook in order to watch video” Facebook’s director of video product Daniel Danker tells me. “When they come with that in mind, we want to make a place for them where they can find that video, connect with the creators and publishers they love, and know they won’t miss out if there’s a new episode from one of those creators.”\nHere’s a list of some of the original programming that will be available on Watch:\nWhat’s clearly absent is the type of longer-form scripted dramas and comedies people are used to watching on television. Instead, there are plenty of mini-documentaries, reality shows, and sports coverage.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg writes that “We believe it’s possible to rethink a lot of experiences through the lens of building community — including watching video. Watching a show doesn’t have to be passive . . . You’ll be able to chat and connect with people during an episode, and join groups with people who like the same shows afterwards to build community.”\nWhen you open Watch, you’ll be able to scroll through a long list of categories of shows to view. Alternatively, you can either swipe over or arrive from a notification about a new episode to view the Watchlist of all the lastest shows released by creators you follow. Once you’ve opened an episode you’ll see all the details about it, with one tab for joining a live comment reel with other viewers, and an “Up Next” tab displaying what you’ll view after the current episode if you prefer a glazed-eyes lean-back experience.\nThere’s no specific content restrictions on swearing or violence beyond Facebook’s existing community standards, but Facebook will monitor for shows that get flagged.\nPublishers can choose to insert ad breaks if they want to earn money off their shows, though the guidelines on where and how long they can be are still being finalized. If publishers want to give away their content, they don’t have to show ads. Another option is to do product placed or branded content, in which case the creator has to tag the sponsor paying them for transparency. Shows will have their own dedicated Facebook Pages, and creators can set up special show Groups where fans can ask questions and geek out together.\nBeyond the Watch tab, you can also discover shows through the News Feed if a publisher you follow posts an episode or friends are talking about it. That gives Facebook the opportunity to artificially boost the presence of shows in News Feed to build a bigger audience for the new content initiative.\nFacebook first launched its dedicated video tab in April 2016, but it only hosted the more generic News Feed videos people were already seeing from Pages and friends. Now Facebook is in the business of funding original content, initially through direct payments, though it seeks to switch entirely to a revenue-share model in the future to make its original programming effort sustainable.\nFacebook’s competitors like YouTube and Snapchat have already experimented with creating original video content. YouTube Red funds several original series, giving bigger production budgets to some of its biggest stars. Snapchat has tried making its own shows in-house, but now focuses on signing deals with partners like TV studios to get fresh, vertical video content into its Discover section.\nFacebook’s benefit is that Watch is cross-platform, allowing people to view videos from all their devices, while also being a daily destination for 1.32 billion users. It’s already become a powerhouse in serendipitous video discovery via the News Feed, and Watch will surely provide enough suggestions to get people hooked on shows they weren’t expecting.\nBut through premium original programming, Facebook is also trying to become a home for deliberate video consumption where people come to view a specific show. While there are already plenty of reasons to visit Facebook, original shows give people a reason to spend longer staring at their screens. If it can drive enough viewers to these shows thanks to its 2 billion total users, Facebook could offer significant revenue-share payouts, attracting better and better content creators.\nFacebook’s been trying to eat the whole internet for years now.

For example, some spammers try to fool Facebook’s review team and tech by showing any of its staffers’ IP addresses a benign landing page for links or ads, while everyone else sees diet pill scams or porn that violate Facebook’s community standards and ad policies.\nSo today, Facebook is cracking down on cloaking. Facebook ads product director Rob Leathern tells me now when it discovers a site using cloaking, “We’ll deactivate their ad counts, we’ll kick them off, we’ll get rid of their Pages.” Facebook will use both humans and expanded artificial intelligence systems to root out cloakers. However, it’s not publicly disclosing the signals it uses to identify cloaking so it doesn’t tip-off the spammers.\nInnocent businesses should see no impact. “There’s no legitimate use case for cloaking,” Leathern says. “If we find it, it doesn’t really matter who that actor is. They’re usually bad actors and spammers by definition. So the line is if anyone does this in any way, shape, or form, we want them off the platform.” Here, Facebook is merely seeking out cloaking, rather than passing judgement on site content.\nThe change comes as part of a multi-pronged attack on hoaxes, clickbait, spam and low-quality sites following criticism that Facebook didn’t prevent fake news from influencing the 2016 presidential election. By cutting off traffic to spam sites, Facebook can choke out the financial lifeblood of bad actors spreading misinformation for profit or political motives.\nAccording to a recent study of 4 million posts by more than 450 Facebook Pages spreading hyperpartisan political news, BuzzFeed concluded that “Publishers are obsessed with Facebook’s algorithm changes and with avoiding getting caught up in the social network’s stepped-up initiative to reduce clickbait and misinformation in the News Feed.”\nCloaking isn’t just a Facebook problem, though. That’s why it plans to work with other tech companies to share strategies for defeating cloakers. Facebook tells me it’s early days in these conversations with the industry about how to address this more collectively. But if it shares the fingerprints of cloakers the way it does to thwart uploads of terrorist content or child pornography, Facebook could use experience from its massive scale to inoculate fellow fixtures of the internet.", "tags": "facebook-news-feed,spam,facebook-fake-news", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/facebook-cloaking/", "id": "1525108"}, {"title": "This app quickly mutes 100 crowdsourced topics from your Twitter timeline", "text": "If you’re sick of politics, sport and general world news then you’re probably best off avoiding social media altogether.\nBut if you want to have your cake and eat it, there is another option to prevent unwanted items filling up your precious timeline on Twitter. Try Mute, a way to quickly mute 100 words from Twitter as chosen by the wisdom of people on the internet — aka crowdsourced.\nTwitter has long supported muting words, but Mute makes it easy to really get into the feature. Its Mute.life website lists 100 keywords that have been added and then voted on by visitors to form a ranked list. By installing a bookmark in your (Google Chrome) browser, Mute can be used to automatically add those top 100 words into your muted word list for Twitter.\nTo get started, visit Mute.life and follow the instructions on the left-side of the screen. You can mute individual words, but the process behind that is pretty cumbersome since it involves copy-paste and manual entry. A better approach may be uploading the full 100 and then removing those you words that you don’t want to mute. Consider Mute the starting point.\nI took Mute — which was created by nomadic developer Pieter Levels — for a spin and it worked as advised. Within a few minutes I had 100 muted words set up.\nThe only problem was the crowd — the main selling point — since many of the words I had muted weren’t topics that I wanted to banish from my timeline altogether.\n\nThat said, I’m not really the target audience here. I can’t remember muting any/many keywords over the years. But, if you’re someone who is looking to make use of Twitter’s mute feature, then this service gives you a jump start at doing that.\nLevels said on Product Hunt that he is working to bring Mute to Facebook — that’s certainly a feature that would appeal to more people, so we’ll stay tuned on that.\nUpdate: Facebook muting is now supported too — full details on the website here.", "tags": "mute,pieter-levels", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/mute-twitter/", "id": "1525011"}, {"title": "Facebook says it’s removing accidental clicks from its ad network", "text": "Advertisers on Facebook’s Audience Network will no longer have to worry that they’re paying for users who accidentally clicked on their ads.\nI’m betting we’ve all had moments where we were scrolling or swiping or clicking through a website/mobile app and we ended up clicking on an ad without really meaning to. (Those moments probably outnumber the times I’ve intentionally clicked on an ad.)\nSo Product Marketing Manager Brett Vogel said Facebook won’t be charging for those clicks in its Audience Network (where Facebook runs ads in other apps), and those clicks won’t be included in the metrics shared with advertisers and publishers.\nFacebook is sorting out unintentional clicks by discounting instances where a user bounces back after two seconds or less. After all, if you clicked on an ad and then immediately clicked back, you probably didn’t care about the ad.\nStill, Vogel said the two-second threshold is a “starting point” that Facebook can adjust if necessary.\nPublishers may worry that this change could hurt their bottom line, but Vogel said the “vast majority” will not be affected, because their ads aren’t driving a significant number of unintentional clicks. He added that Facebook is making the change for the good of the ecosystem.\n“Unintentional clicks end up delivering really poor experiences for people and advertisers,” he said. “It’s not a good path for publishers to build sustainable businesses.”\nIn addition, Facebook is also announcing that it’s making new ad metrics available (it’s been making a broader push around this).\nThose metrics including gross impressions, a number that combines billable impressions with non-billable impressions — advertisers aren’t paying for things like non-human traffic, but some of them have still asked to see the numbers.

We store our memories in Instagram and Facebook, revisit our years-old micro-thoughts on Twitter, track our health with apps like Clue and FitBit, and the list goes on and on. Swarm, with the launch of version 5.0, wants to be the best at telling you about where you’ve been in the real world.\nThat starts with a brand new home page, simplifying the app considerably. The old Swarm launched you into a page with five tabs at the bottom and two tabs at the top, offering the ability to look at your own check-ins as well as the check-ins of your friends.\nNow, the home screen has just three tabs: Me, Check-in, and My Friends.\n“Historically, our biggest challenge has been to make things simpler as opposed to more complex,” said Foursquare cofounder and Executive Chairman Dennis Crowley. “It’s very easy to continue adding features, but we challenged ourselves to remove 70 percent of the complexity from the app so that users can understand it right away.”\nSwarm 5.0 launches directly into the Profile (Me) tab, with an interactive map at the top showing you exactly where you’ve been. At a glance, I can see that I’ve been to 671 places across 77 categories, making up a total of 1,277 check-ins.\nBelow the map, you’ll find your own timeline of events, including who was there with you and how many coins you received. More importantly, however, the profile page offers a fantastic search tool. Users can search by friends they checked in with, city, category, or even the type of restaurant.\nThis should make it easier for users to remember where they’ve been no matter how much time has passed.\nAt the top of the Profile page is your profile picture. Clicking into it will take the user to their personal insight page, letting users check on their mayorships, their top categories, sticker progress, photos, and friends.\nSpeaking of, the Friends feed is also somewhat simplified, integrating the old “Games” tab into the friend timeline to show where you stand on the leaderboard. And, as expected, users can follow along chronologically with their friends check-ins from this page, which is also searchable.\nNotifications on friend requests and incoming direct messages can also be found on the top right of the Friends page.\nThe check-in screen is the most familiar in the new Swarm 5.0. The app automatically decides where you are instead of sending you into a search page, with easy options to change location quickly.\nAll the same accoutrements, like stickers, text, friend-tagging and photos, are all available in their usual spots. However, alongside the Twitter and Facebook share buttons, Swarm has now added an Off-The-Grid button for folks who want to check-in without broadcasting their location to their friends.\n“We were seeing a lot of people ask ‘what the heck is this thing?’,” said Crowley. “Super users stuck with the app but we were losing a lot of new users in the meantime. This version of the app is designed so users can really understand the story behind it and hopefully fall in love with it.”\nSwarm has seemingly come full circle from its origins within the old Foursquare, letting users log their locations in a searchable fashion. After ditching mayorships and leaderboards in the first iteration of Swarm, those things are now alive and well. After trying and failing to introduce a social utility that lets friends meet up in the real world, the core of Foursquare check-ins has remained.\nIn short: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.", "tags": "dennis-crowley,swarm", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/swarm-kills-the-clutter-focuses-on-logging-location/", "id": "1524566"}, {"title": "Facebook shuts down its Snapchat competitor Lifestage and its standalone Groups app", "text": "Facebook is paring down its collection of standalone apps. The company’s experimental “teens-only” app Lifestage, designed to counteract Snapchat’s threat, has been pulled from the App Store. Its disappearance was first spotted by Business Insider, and Facebook confirmed its removal. However, Lifestage isn’t the only Facebook app that’s being killed off as of late – the company is also closing down its Groups app, first launched in 2014 to help users better discover, search and connect with their various Facebook Groups.\nIn its announcement about the Groups’ app’s closure, Facebook said it believed the team could do more for the community by working on improvements to Groups within the main Facebook app.\nIt seems that’s been the case for some time, however. The Facebook Groups app had grown to be very buggy in recent months, often to the point of becoming unusable. And it didn’t look like Facebook had any interest in fixing those glitches, much less continuing to roll out improvements to the Groups app overall.\n\nGroups, I’d argue, ultimately failed because it didn’t address the problem with using Groups on Facebook at all. There was no News Feed in the app where you could browse just Group posts without Page updates and status updates from friends mixed in; there was no universal search across your Groups; and there was no way to organize Groups into collections for easier access, among other oversights.\nThe app itself has already been removed from the App Store, and will stop functioning for existing users on September 1st, Facebook says.\nWhile Facebook Groups is still a key focus for the social network going forward – if not as its own, separate mobile experience – it’s not as surprising that Facebook shutting down Lifestage.\nThat app, by design, targeted a limited user base – only those 21 or younger could even sign up. Launched last year by then 19-year old product designer Michael Sayman, Lifestage put a heavy emphasis on video and on getting to know your friends through a Q&A type experience.\nBut Facebook no longer needs a direct counterpoint to Snapchat. It has Instagram. In April, Instagram’s Stories feature hit 200 million users, surpassing Snapchat’s user base of 161 million. As of this month, Instagram Stories has 250 million daily users compared to Snapchat’s 166 million.\nThe company has blatantly ripped off some of Snapchat’s best features, like its augmented reality and selfie filters. Its ability to clone Snapchat’s features is speeding up, TechCrunch’s Josh Constine also recently noted. Though it took nearly three years to launch its version of Stories, Instagram was able to copy the “create your stickers” feature in four months.\nThat leaves little need to continue to focus on an app like Lifestage, which never became an App Store success. At the beginning of August, it was ranked #1,392 on the iOS’s free charts in the U.S., and unranked on Google Play.\nThis is not the first time Facebook has cleaned house of under-performing apps. A couple of years ago, it closed down its internal incubator Creative Labs, along with several of its apps, including photo-sharing app Slingshot, anonymous chat app Rooms, and collaborative video app Riff.", "tags": "groups,mobile,lifestage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/facebook-shuts-down-its-snapchat-competitor-lifestage-and-its-standalone-groups-app/", "id": "1524635"}, {"title": "MojiLaLa, the sticker marketplace, lands $1.5M seed round from Great Oaks, betaworks", "text": "The launch of iOS 10 and its iMessage Store has launched emojis and stickers into mainstream communication.

MojiLaLa does all the heavy lifting for artists for free, letting them focus on their artwork instead of their business development.\nMojiLaLa lists these sticker packs within iOS on behalf of the artists, and splits revenue 50/50. Loberg says that, eventually, the company plans to expand artist revenues to an 80 percent share once the visual communication revolution is in full swing.\nAlongside listing sticker packs for artists, MojiLaLa also has its own app (MojiLaLa Unlimited) that lets users subscribe to get complete access to over 25,000 stickers. Users pay $1.99/month to get access to these stickers, and artists who opt-in to list on MojiLaLa unlimited get an extra level of visibility for their work.\nAs we advance closer to mainstream AR/VR experiences, a relationship with artists become incredibly important.

Called Trips, the app uses an Instagram-like design populated with beautiful images of far away places.\nMuch like Lonely Planet’s website, the idea behind Trips is to offer travelers an easy way to share their experiences and discover new areas of the world — this time on their smartphones.\nHowever, Instagram already has a healthy amount of travel enthusiasts uploading photos of fantastic places for viewers to check out on a daily basis. National Geographic, a personal favorite, is one of the most popular on the platform, with a following of nearly 80 million. Lonely Planet, by comparison, has about 1.4 million followers on the platform.\nLike Instagram, you can “heart,” share and follow profiles on Trips, as well. But Lonely Planet’s Daniel Houghton says the intention is not to compete with the social media giant, but to complement it.\nLonely Planet is an O.G. travel site and has its own loyal niche of travel enthusiasts. Perhaps an app focusing precisely on their passion will be well received.\nTrips is Lonely Planet’s second app. The online destinations site launched its first app Guides last year, which provides “tips and advice from on-the-ground experts.” More than one million people have since downloaded Guides. Lonely Planet hopes Trips will be met with the same success.\nSo why not just roll Trips features into Guides and make one app? Houghton tells TechCrunch Guides is more of a tool, whereas Trips is geared for sharing content.\nThe app is pretty easy to use; just download, select profiles that suit your interest and scroll through the feed. From there you can pick from a number of the populated stories, many of which will come with maps, photos and some information on tours and things you might want to check out. I was personally checking out Rainbow Mountain in Peru posted about a day ago while scrolling through the app.\nYou also can hit the discover icon at the bottom of the app, to the right of the home icon, to search for categories like “Adventure” or “Wildlife and Nature.” From there it will lead you to a feed similar to the home feed but with certain trips in mind.\nIt’s pretty easy to publish your own trips, as well. Like Instagram, you just hit the plus-sign icon at the bottom of the screen. The app will require access to your phone camera and then you’ll be able to add your photos. The app will automatically populate a map of the area and allow you to add content and more info about your trip from there.\nThe one thing I would say Trips lacks is a search tool. It’s fine to scroll through the places the app provides in the feed, but it’s difficult to look up specific places you are thinking of visiting. If you are like me, you’ll want the ability to look up a place before planning your trip to see what others have to say about it and look at the photos they took.\nFor those interested in checking it out yourself, Trips is now available for free on iOS and will be available on Android later this year.", "tags": "ios-apps,travel,lonely-planet", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/lonely-planet-launches-an-instagram-like-trips-app/", "id": "1524370"}, {"title": "N26 now has 500,000 customers for its bank of the future", "text": "Fintech startup N26 is getting more and more customers.

This was, after all, how the co-founders originally came up with the idea for the Prisma app — having seen a style transfer effect working (slowly) on a desktop computer and realized how much potential it would have if it could be made to work in near real-time on mobile.\n“The first plan is ready to go solution when you have an idea and want to implement, for example, style transfer or object recognition or something like face masks… or Snapchat lenses,” says CEO and co-founder Alexey Moiseenkov, fleshing out what’s coming from Prisma Labs. “If you need this ability we can offer you a ready to go SDK that you can implement in your app.”\nCo-founder Aram Airapetyan gives an example of how their AI-powered image segmentation technology could also be used to allow users of Skype — for example —  to push a button to change or blank out the background during a video call. (Meaning this wouldn’t have to happen, for example.)\nThe wave of augmented reality apps that are coming down the smartphone pipe, driven by more powerful hardware and active encouragement from mobile platforms, could also help generate demand for Prisma’s effects, reckons Moiseenkov, as they can offer object tracking as well as face tracking via APIs or an SDK.\n“The second part [of the b2b offering] is we feel that in a lot of companies developers are struggling with porting technologies to mobile,” he continues. “And we feel that we can offer them our own solution that we use internally — internally we have… a platform that can help us to experiment with our research and producing a lot of demo apps for internal usage and choosing the right one.”\nThey say they’ve been testing the developer tools with “some very big companies” — but won’t name any names as yet.\n“We want to explore the CV [computer vision] area and help companies also produce a greater user experience with AI — helping people to communicate easier, to solve their tasks,” adds Moiseenkov.\n“We feel that AI can help a lot of companies to improve the user experience a lot. The camera, working with images, filtering, de-noising, a lot of different stuff can happen — and that’s cool. I feel it can improve the overall quality of apps in App Store and Google Play.”\nPrisma’s consumer app shot to painterly popularity last summer, offering smartphone users the ability to transform a standard smartphone photo by quickly and easily applying different graphical styles — to create, for example, a pastiche of a particular artwork or graphical effect.\nThe app achieved its effects not by applying filters to the photo but by utilizing neural networks and deep learning to process the original photo in the chosen style — generating a new image that combined both input sources.\nBy December last year, Prisma had racked up around 70 million downloads and earned itself a bunch of app store accolades. But it also attracted the attention of platform giants like Facebook who quickly rolled out style transfer features of their own — helping to cap the app’s momentum.\nThe team then experimented with adding social elements to the style transfer tool, to see if they could turn Prisma into a social platform in its own right — although, given how dominated the consumer social/messaging space is, by giants like Facebook and WeChat, that always looked like a forlorn hope.\nBranching into b2b looks a more solid strategic step for Prisma, positioning the team to offer developers an accelerated route for burnishing the feature-set/UX of their own apps, and selling these b2b services with the help of demonstrable AI-powered visual effects expertise.\nSo although Prisma is shifting its monetization strategy (likely a usage-based SDK for the visual effects; and maybe a licensing model for the platform, it says), its consumer apps aren’t going away. Indeed, they now double as both testing ground and showcase for what its tech can do for other developers.\n“Since the start of this year we were thinking about exploring our opportunities in terms of how to earn money in an efficient way, and we decided to go where we can help companies with computer vision or AI — in terms of more consumer-oriented applications,” Moiseenkov tells TechCrunch.\n“We focus on effects; video effects on a mobile camera… We feel this is a really rich area for a company like ours. And also we feel that with our apps in the market we can experiment a lot with different technologies and this pairing can do a lot for us in terms of earning money.”\n“We have a very strong R&D team,” adds Airapetyan. “We have lots of guys who are researching and investigating what we can do in terms of different technologies and AI-based products so we’ve been working on these technologies for a while.”\nThe team launched a second consumer app in July: a sticker-maker called Sticky that uses AI algorithms to perform quick cut-outs of selfies so they can be easily repurposed as colorful stickers.\nAcross both apps they say they’re getting between 5M to 10M MAUs [monthly active users] and ~500,000 DAUs [daily active users] at this point — with Airapetyan describing their user base as “very stable”.\nPrisma’s own team is around 25-strong, split between offices in the Bay Area and Moscow. Though they say they’re also eyeing setting up a base in China — seeing “huge” potential to sell AI-related services in such a large and visually engaged app ecosystem.\nThe team has previously raised seed funding, although it has never disclosed how much. According to Crunchbase investors in its seed include Gagarin Capital Partners, Haxus and Nikolai Oreshkin. (Notably Haxus was also an investor in Fabby, a computer vision app recently acquired by Google.)\nMoiseenkov says Prisma hasn’t raised any funding since the end of last year, and is not currently looking to raise — they want to see how their b2b play plays out first, he adds.\nOn the competition front for b2b CV/AI tools, he points to a couple of big companies in Asia offering similar services already — such as Face++.  He also name checks Clarifai as another competitor offering image recognition, as well as Google’s image processing APIs — though he claims Google isn’t offering developers a lot of choice vs the plan for Prisma Labs.\n“We are working on a very, very wide-range of AI-based technologies,” adds Airapetyan.", "tags": "visual-effects,style-transfer,ai,prisma", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/19/prisma-shifts-focus-to-b2b-with-an-api-for-ai-powered-mobile-effects/", "id": "1528433"}, {"title": "Coup launches new electric scooter service in Paris and faces off with Cityscoot", "text": "Coup is launching its second city for its electronic scooter-sharing service.

And/or pull consumers away from Huawei’s flagships handsets — or indeed the swathe of Chinese OEMs surging up the smartphone market share ranks.\nWith the Nokia 8, HMD is putting its flagship focus on content creators wanting to livestream video for their social feeds.\nCompetition in the Android OEM space has been fierce for years and there’s no signs of any slack appearing so HDM faces a steep challenge to make any kind of dent here. But at least it now has an iron in the fire. As analyst CCS Insight notes, the handset will be “hugely important in getting Nokia-branded smartphones back on the mobile phone map”.\nSpecs wise, the Nokia 8 runs the latest version of Android (Nougat 7.1.1) — which HMD is touting as a “pure Android experience”, akin to Google’s Pixel handsets. (There’s a not-so-gentle irony there, given Nokia’s history in smartphones. But clearly HMD is going full in on Android.)\nOn the hardware front, there’s a top end Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, plus 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory (expandable thanks to a MicroSD card slot). While the 5.3 inch Quad HD resolution display puts it on the verge of phablet territory — and squarely within the current smartphone screen size sweet spot.\nAlso on board: dual rear cameras, both 13MP (one color, one B&W), and a 13MP front facing lens — all with f/2.0; using Zeiss optics; and with support for 4K video.\nThe flagship camera feature — and really phone feature too — is the ability to livestream video from both front and back cameras simultaneously.\nHMD is trying to coin a hashtaggable word to describe this: “bothie” (as opposed to a selfie)…\nThis split screen camera feature can also be used for photos — so they’ve basically reinvented Frontback. Well done.\n“Content creators can natively broadcast their unique #Bothie stories to social media through the Dual-Sight functionality located within the camera app. Fans can also enjoy unlimited photo [<16MB in size] and video uploads to Google Photos,” HMD writes.\nThis could prove a sticky feature for social media lovers — perhaps especially the dual video option, which lets people share twin perspective video direct to Facebook and YouTube via the camera app.\nOr it could prove a passing fad, like Frontback. Time will tell. CCS Insight describes it as an “interesting approach” but also cautions on whether consumers will take to it.\nCommenting on the feature in a statement, HMD’s Juho Sarvikas, chief product officer, said: “We know that fans are creating and sharing live content more than ever before, with millions of photos and videos shared every minute on social media. People are inspired by the content they consume and are looking for new ways to create their own. It’s these people who have inspired us.”\nElsewhere on the device, there’s a spatial surround sound recording tech that uses three microphones and is apparently drawing on Nokia’s Ozo 360 camera division, plus USB type C charging port; a 3.5mm headphone jack; and a non-removable 3090 mAh battery.\nThe handset, which is clad in an aluminium unibody casing and has a fingerprint reader on the front for device unlocking and authentication, is described as splashproof rather than waterproof.\nGlobal RRP for the Nokia 8 is €599, with a rollout due to start in September. The handset comes in a choice of four colors: Polished Blue, Polished Copper, Tempered Blue and Steel.\nThis post was updated with a correction: the display is Quad HD (2560 x 1440), not ultra HD as originally stated", "tags": "smartphones,nokia", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/android-newbie-hmds-nokia-8-flagship-lets-you-livestream-frontbacks/", "id": "1527946"}, {"title": "Digi.me and Personal merge to put you in control of the nascent ‘personal data ecosystem’", "text": "Digi.me and Personal, two companies that broadly play in the personal data space by offering apps to securely store and share various data about yourself, are announcing a merger. Terms of deal remain undisclosed, although I’m told that the combined entity will operate under the Digi.me brand and give the company a 60-person headcount who will operate out of a global HQ near London in the U.K. and a U.S. operation based in Washington, DC.\nPersonal’s enterprise solution TeamData will be spun off as a separate information security and productivity solution for businesses, while the broader and hugely ambitious vision for the resulting Digi.me remains to become a major player in what founder and Chair Julian Ranger calls the emerging ‘personal data ecosystem’.\nThe premise, Ranger told me during a call late last week, is that consumers are being enticed to hand over more and more personal data in return for better products and services, but what is still needed is a platform to put you in control of how and who that data is shared with. This needs to be done in a transparent way, and the resulting platform on which companies can build apps on top of should adhere to the principal of informed consent.\nBetter still, what if your data doesn’t unnecessarily leave your own device or personal cloud storage but can still be shared with businesses on a per use case basis? Nearly 7 years in the making, this is the promise of Digi.me and now combined with Personal.\nThe way Digi.me works is that the mobile or desktop app asks where in your personal cloud you want your data stored — currently that means Dropbox, with the other usual suspects supported soon — and then it asks you to connect the app to various personal data-points. Right now this means social (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram etc.), with financial and health data currently in various testing phases, including a country-wide ‘living lab’ project with Iceland.\nWhen needed, data stored in your personal cloud is securely processed via your own temporary virtual machine instance sitting on Microsoft’s Azure cloud so that it is normalised and kept up to date, with the local Digi.me app essentially acting as the front end, gatekeeper (including the holder of the needed keys), and distributor for that data.\nThen when a third-party app needs access to a particular subset of your data, say your transactions for the last 24 months to do a more accurate credit score, it authenticates via the Digi.me app — meaning that you have to explicitly agree to the specific data request — and the Digi.me app pulls the data from your personal cloud and grants the third-party app access to it.\n“Companies and developers can… use Digi.me’s APIs to request access to integrated data sets to provide better data-driven experiences, services, and rewards, and to provide other benefits like rich personal analytics. Health, wearable and music data will also be available soon after the merger,” explains the new joint company.\nOne crucial point here, however, and what makes the Digi.me proposition different from other approaches to personal data sharing is that the platform has been designed so that in many instances a third-party app can also process the data locally, meaning that it doesn’t need to leave your device. Instead, sticking to the example of a credit score checking app, it only transmits and stores the resulting credit score on its own servers, not the personal financial data it was based on.\nThat, says Ranger, changes the game completely and should in time mean consumers become comfortable sharing more data in return for new kinds of products and services. “Do more, privately,” is the company’s mantra.\n“It isn’t about privacy or sharing, but both privacy and sharing when the point of integration and ownership is the individual,” he says, arguing that this opens up individuals to sharing data that they don’t today such as health, finance, and more.\nLikewise, and where Digi.me sees a potentially very large business (since it charges on a per access basis, capped at $3 per user), is that the platform allows any company to have what he quite convincingly argues can be better data than Google et al because it can be wider and deeper and should remain a lot more accurate.\nHowever, for this to become a reality, Ranger concedes it needs two things: Users to find enough utility in Digi.me to download the app and connect it to an increasing number of personal data points, and businesses wanting to develop on the platform, who, in turn, want access to enough users to make it worth their while. The classic platform chicken and egg, you might say.\nTo address this, Ranger says the app has been designed to be useful first and foremost on an individual and private basis as a way for you to search and get better insights into your own personal data, which benefits from being stored in a single place not multiple silos.\nAnd for businesses who might not see Digi.me as delivering enough users yet — it counts around 400,000 — it has signed a number of partnerships to have those businesses also become a distribution channel for Digi.me. The logic being that a business could offer new functionality in its own app or service that requires a customer to start using Digi.me.\nMeanwhile, today’s merger is all about Digi.me having a foothold in North America. As part of that it sees Shane Green, co-founder and CEO of Personal, become CEO of Digi.me’s U.S. operation.\nDigi.me and Personal have raised over $40 million combined. Investors include Omidyar Network (the self-styled “philanthropic investment firm” co-founded by eBay founder Pierre Omidya), SwissRe, Planetary Holdings, TCS Capital Management, Allen & Company, Revolution Ventures, Ted Leonsis, and Esther Dyson.\n", "tags": "personal,digi-me", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/digi-me-and-personal-merge/", "id": "1527032"}, {"title": "Wave hello to Kano’s latest learn-to-code tool, a gesture controller", "text": "Author note: Abel Owen is Ingrid’s nine-year-old son. These are mostly his words; Ingrid just helped type them a little faster.\nI use computers and the Internet all the time and really like them. They are an important part of modern life. And it’s pretty cool to know how they work. So when my mom asked me to help her review some Kano products I was like, “Yes! Let’s do it right now!”\nKano, if you don’t know about it already, is a company that makes interactive coding devices for children (and others) to help them learn more about technology and how computers and other electronic devices work. In the past couple of weeks I have looked at two different Kano devices, the Pixel Kit and the Motion Sensor Kit.\nI started off with the Pixel Kit, a hand-held LED light board that launched in July.\nIt was pretty exciting since I was using an actual machine, using coding to control it. I liked how the whole thing came in parts in the box, and we had to assemble it as part of getting to use it. It reminded me of something my dad and I play with called Snap Circuits.\nThen when it’s put together, you link it up with your computer using the Kano app. You create an account and then your kit and computer are connected.\nI had used Scratch at school before, which is coding to make video games on a tiny screen. This was a bit cooler since with a Pixel Kit you could create programs (animations, they call them, made either with the Kano’s own coding blocks or JavaScript) that control the Pixel’s 128 LED lights. I liked making light shows that responded to sound: clapping or other loud noises would give you bursts of light. They were awesome (my mom says I can’t keep writing ‘cool’).\n\nI also made games, following the Kano instructions. One was about a hero in search of a treasure. You have to guide the hero towards the treasure.\nThere was also an accelerometer that you could attach which let you create games where you could tilt the Pixel Kit (it fits in your hand) to move the lights around. Kano has the scripts set up like tasks for you to learn, which helps learn how to do it. I’m pretty sure I could create my own simple games now for the Pixel without the instructions.\nA couple of weeks later, we added to our Kano collection with the Motion Sensor Kit. This is a small gesture controller that also works with the Kano app.\nYou don’t need the Pixel Kit to use it. Like the Pixel, you create scripts on your Kano app. With the Motion Sensor, those scripts let the app respond to your movements as you wave your hand over the motion sensor.\nOne of the scripts I made was to make a “strumming guitar.” When you waved your hand over the motion sensor as if you were strumming a guitar, on the apps screen you could see guitar strings that moved and made sounds with your movements.\nYou could also create little pictures that responded to the movements, turtles that spin and snakes that go up and down. And others like this:\n\nAs with the Pixel, you can also make games. One that I liked was “Pong,” which made my hand into a table tennis paddle and I played with the computer.\nMy mom wants me to say also what I didn’t like about both. I think to improve the Pixel Kit, it would be good if there were a wider range of things to do, and maybe a way to fit more than three of your own creations on to your Pixel Kit. That would make it more exciting.\nIt was also a little fragile, especially since it’s kids using it. One day the battery just disconnected from the ‘brain’ (we had to glue it back). And my mom broke off the power button while trying to glue the battery back, so we had to glue that, too.\n(ed. note: We accept this is possibly more our fault than Kano’s. Also, it would have been good to be able to get a Kano app for an iPad or the Google Chromebook Pixel that the family uses rather than a Mac. The Kano products also work with Windows computers and the previously released Kano Computer Kit.)\nThe Motion Sensor was more sturdy, but it would have been better if it wasn’t tethered to my mom’s Mac.\nThe Motion Sensor Kit is retailing for $29.99 / £29.99; the Pixel Kit sells for $79.99 / £74.99.\nBoth can be purchased either directly through the Kano store. In the US, they will soon also be on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Toys R Us, ThinkGeek and Gamestop. In Canada, the product will be available at Indigo, Toys R Us and The Source. In the UK, it will also be on amazon.co.uk.\nKano — co-founded by Alex Klein, Yonatan Raz-Fridman, and Saul Klein — has raised $19 million in funding to date. That includes funding it raised in a Kickstarter campaign that went viral, and a later, more formal venture round for $15 million. Backers include Jim Breyer, Marc Benioff, Martin Sorrell, Index Ventures, James Higa, Troy Carter and Shana Fisher.\nWe hope you liked this blog.", "tags": "children,learn-to-code,coding,kano", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/wave-hello-to-kanos-latest-learn-to-code-tool-a-gesture-controller/", "id": "1526876"}, {"title": "London fintech Tail is a cashback platform built on the promise of Open Banking", "text": "London-based Tail is a new fintech startup that offers a glimpse into the promise of Open Banking. This is seeing upcoming legislation in the EU and U.K. force banks to offer third-party developer access to your bank account data — with your permission, of course.\nThe app, initially available for iOS and serving London only, offers heavy discounts at local places to eat and drink, all linked to the card you pay with and delivered each week in the form of cashback. However, the draw is how seamlessly it all takes place, by being built on top of digital-only challenger bank Starling‘s API, with Monzo integration also in the works.\nThis means that it is as simple as granting the Tail app access to your Starling bank account, a one tap process akin to Facebook or Twitter log-in, presuming that you are already a customer of Starling. Once you’ve agreed to a set of permissions — which can be a little daunting the first time, even though they can be easily revoked within the Starling app at any time — any offers that pop up in the Tail app can be redeemed simply by using your Starling MasterCard at the corresponding merchant.\nNo coupons or receipt scanning or even having to explicitly tell Tail the bank account or card number you want your cashback deposited. And, presumably, once your Starling card has expired (or is lost or stolen), you won’t have to manually link your new card to Tail as it will simply pull the new card info via the challenger bank’s API.\nMy takeaway: Open Banking is going to be nothing if not convenient, depending on how comfortable you are with granting third-party apps access to your banking data.\n“Tail is turning open banking APIs into an offer platform, thereby eliminating all friction points for retailers and consumers which are still inherent in today’s solutions,” Tail founder and CEO Philipp Keller, who was previously at Morgan Stanley, tells me.\n“Using Tail, consumers can browse through a selection of curated offers, which are pre-linked to their bank card, eliminating the need for physical vouchers or coupon codes. The offer feed is updated in real-time and location specific. Redemption happens in-app, allowing for a more discreet way of redeeming offers, and accumulated savings are distributed back to the user in the form of cash back paid out in regular intervals”.\nMeanwhile, along with making it super convenient for customers to discover and redeem offers, the Tail CEO reckons it is addressing a number of merchant pain points too, and thus opening up this kind of offers platform to smaller independents right down to the Long Tail.\n“There’s no EPOS integration or codes required, no staff involvement whatsoever, they don’t have to download an app and we track the redemption stats for them,” he says. “The retailer provides card details and tells us what type of campaign she wants to run, the discount and the applicable times”.\nIn addition, new tools, such as real-time flash campaigns or “sequenced offers,” help to address specific issues such as spare capacity utilisation and new customer acquisition more effectively.\nFlash campaigns that are simple to run via Tail could include a merchant offering 50 per cent off on a rainy day, or putting up an offer for the next 30 minutes during an unexpected lull in footfall. And by “sequenced offers,” Keller is referring to ways of enticing first time customers to become repeat customers, such as different discounts depending on if it is a first, second or third visit to a particular restaurant.\n“We’re looking to turn this into a self-serve platform at some point. At that point it will be even easier; just insert campaign type (first-time customers, off-peak hours, etc) and enter card details,” he adds.", "tags": "monzo,starling", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/tail-at/", "id": "1526655"}, {"title": "Moneytis is like a travel fare aggregator, but for sending money abroad", "text": "If you don’t care too much about loyalty programs, chances are that you’ve been relying on platforms like Booking.com and Expedia to find the cheapest flights and hotel rooms. Moneytis wants to do the exact same thing, but for foreign exchange services.\nTransferWise is arguably the biggest consumer brand in international transfers. Instead of telling your bank to send money to your bank account, you send money to TransferWise first. The startup then converts the amount and transfers your money to the other account abroad.\nIt’s been an eye-opening experience for many consumers who realized that they’re getting screwed by banks, Western Union, Moneygram, etc.\nBut TransferWise is just one player in this space. For instance, while the startup is usually quite competitive when you want to convert GBP into EUR, it’s not as competitive when you want to send money from the U.S. to Europe. Other services, such as CurrencyFair let you keep more money at the end of your transfer.\nThat’s why Moneytis is applying the Booking.com model to international transfers. The experience is quite straightforward as you just have to put two different currencies and how much money you plan on sending.\n“I was an expat in China and Etienne [Tatur] was in Europe. And I was shocked by hidden fees every time I wanted to send money,” co-founder and CFO Christophe Lassuyt told me. “That’s when we listed and compared all solutions out there. Friends quickly asked us to see the list. We ended up launching a comparison tool. We then understood that users wanted to compare, but also transfer easily. That’s the service we’re launching.”\nMoneytis then compares many services and displays the fastest service, the cheapest one, the most popular one, etc. You don’t have to sign up to other services as you can send your money directly on Moneytis.\nThe startup doesn’t add any fee. Instead, Moneytis takes a small cut from third-party services as it is generating leads for those foreign exchange services. On average, clients are sending $2,000 — Moneytis takes 0.3 percent (representing $6) and it’s transparent for the user.\nThere’s no clear winner in the foreign exchange space as big players like TransferWise only cover some currencies. Exchange rate volatility also means that some services are going to be cheaper one day and more expensive the next day. Finally, some services will be able to get better deals for particular routes.\nMoneytis is clearly a volume play as the startup will need thousands of transfers per day to scale. It could build an API so that big clients can automate transfers and always use the cheapest service out there.

It lets you write, edit, organize, sync and export all your writing in a single, unified interface. That’s why it’s interesting to see that it is switching to a subscription-only business model.\nI’ve already written about Ulysses a few times. It’s a rock-solid, well-designed writing app for iOS and macOS. It relies on Markdown formatting and lets your export your writing to WordPress and Medium — among other things.\nUlysses is the exact same app on iOS and macOS, proving that you can make professional apps for the iPhone and the iPad. The company behind it won an Apple Design Award at WWDC. It used to cost $45 on the Mac and $25 on iOS.\nWhile the company released a free macOS trial on its website, there was no easy way to let you try the app on your iPhone or iPad. Additionally, it was a bit confusing that you had to buy the same app twice so that you could use it on all your devices. But if you were a serious writer and you were willing to spend $60 on two apps, Ulysses could become your writing studio.\nYesterday, the company announced that it would drop upfront purchases altogether. If you want to use Ulysses, you can now download the app on iOS and macOS to start a 14-day free trial. After that, you have to pay $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year. There’s a $10 discount on the annual subscription if you were a previous Ulysses user, and students are also eligible to a special subscription of $11.99 per six months.\nAnd it turns out that people care a lot about subscriptions. While hundreds of millions of people pay a subscription to access Spotify, Netflix and other content services, making people pay for apps is still unpopular.\nMax Seelemann wrote a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind subscription pricing. As a customer, I’m more than happy to see that subscriptions are going to make Ulysses more sustainable.\nAccording to Ulysses’ website, there are a dozen people working on Ulysses. I looked back at my purchasing history. I was an early Ulysses buyer so I ended up paying less than the full price for both apps. I paid $20 for the Mac app 4 years and a half ago and $20 for the iOS app 18 months ago.\nThere’s no way you can build a successful business with customers that pay $40 over the course of four years and a half. Your local coffee shop probably has a higher customer lifetime value while hiring fewer people.\nSoftware giants, such as Adobe and Microsoft, have successfully switched to subscriptions. The majority of customers and companies pay a monthly fee to access Photoshop, Microsoft Word and other productivity apps.\nBut most small software companies still rely on upfront purchases and regular paid upgrades.

That can mean charging per article or video, or asking users to buy a pass to their site for a limited period of time.\nEne knows that might sound depressingly similar to the micropayment models that have fallen flat, despite the hype that they might save journalism. In fact, he recalled being told by an investor, “Micropayments don’t work on the internet.”\nEne’s response was to point to the sushi dinner that they were eating. If they had to pay for each plate of sushi before they ate it, or if they had to pay “100 bucks before we see the menu,” well, that would be a crummy dining experience. Instead, they ordered the food they wanted and then paid the bill at the end.\nSimilarly, Ene said most micropayment platforms asked users to pay upfront, before they’ve read anything, or when they first hit a paywalled article.\nLaterPay, meanwhile, is supposed to make the payment process as frictionless as possible. Users don’t even have to enter any payment information when they buy their first piece of content — they don’t have to make a purchase at all until their bill reaches $5. As a result, the company says that 78 percent of article purchases made through the LaterPay platform take 10 seconds or less.\nSwitching food metaphors, Ene added, “The vast amount of occasional users just want to buy a glass of milk, but not the whole cow.”\nLaterPay has already signed up some big customers in Germany, including Der Spiegel.\nNow it’s launching in the United States.

This saw the company withdraw from all markets outside of London last month, as part of several rounds of mass-layoffs. Operations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds in the U.K., and Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, have been “paused” indefinitely.\nThe aim, Jinn founder Mario Navarro said at the time, was to continue on a “path towards profitability” by focussing solely on the U.K. capital city, which accounted for 90 per cent of its orders. And now the startup is claiming to have done just that: “Jinn is profitable at an EBITDA level, with 30% contribution margins, and expecting to close the year with $22M in sales,” says the company.\nMeanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that Jinn co-founder and COO Leon Herrera departed the startup two months ago and has relocated back to his home country of Spain. In a call, Navarro said he couldn’t comment directly on Herrera’s reasons for leaving, except to say they weren’t work-related and that the two remain on good terms and that Herrera is still a Jinn shareholder and supporter of the startup.\n“I can confirm that today we are profitable at an EBITDA level,” Navarro tells me. “And that we will be EBITDA profitable in August and for the coming months”.

The startup is also disclosing that headcount sits at a very lean 20 staff members, down from a reported high of around 100, though Navarro wouldn’t confirm that figure.\nIn May this year, the company announced that it had raised $10 million in further funding, capital it planned to use to continue to grow and “consolidate its presence in its main markets”. However, as I’ve noted before, it is far from clear if Jinn’s latest round was based on tranches or contingent on certain milestones or KPIs being met. In other words, it is unlikely Jinn has burned through that cash or that it all entered the company’s balance sheet in the first place. Navarro declined to comment.\n“Jinn is now running a lean and efficient operation with 20 people, and has returned to its true start up roots: empowering employees to get involved in all areas of the business, innovating every day to solve problems and most importantly, getting ready for the challenge of growing the business sustainably,” says the company in a statement.\nJinn says it currently has 1,000 monthly active couriers on the platform, 1,000 partners and over 100,000 customers. It expects to double its current monthly completed orders in the next four months.\nAdds Navarro in a statement: “The departure of some of our amazing employees and close friends has been the most painful part of this decision. Working alongside them has been a privilege and we can’t be thankful enough for all the effort and the commitment they’ve put into the company. We’ve been completely humbled by their understanding of the situation and their willingness to continue supporting Jinn in any way possible.

That’s because the unnamed bank Google Wallet ran on top of could not easily deliver on the promise of pan-European banking via an API.\n“The problem with accessing global or regional wholesale transaction banking services from traditional suppliers (e.g. HSBC, Citi, BAML, Deutsche etc.) is that it takes 3-9 months to open each bank account, up to 9 months to technically connect (as each API is bespoke to the customer) and customers have to sink vast Capex expenditure to make this happen, before a single transaction is done. That is if the bank will even bank you!” Verdon tells me.\nThe main issues behind this holdup and expense is legacy technology that most incumbent banks run on, and the thorny issue of compliance. The latter means that friction isn’t just caused by technology alone but the need to comply with the law and cumbersome systems in place to ensure global banking does so. “Neither are changing anytime soon,” teases Verdon.\nIt is here — at the intersection of technology and compliance, and by using technology to scale compliance — that Verdon and Railsbank’s other founder Clive Mitchell, who is also a fintech veteran, see an opportunity. The resulting banking and compliance platform connects together a global network of partner banks for companies who want API access to global banking. “Access to global transaction banking with 5 lines of code,” akin to something like Stripe for banking, is the Railsbank mantra.\nSpecifically, the platform provides companies with a range of wholesale banking services, including IBANs, receiving money, sending money, converting money, direct debit, issuing cards, and managing credit through APIs. “Our tech solves the legacy issue by hiding it,” explains Verdon.\nHowever, along with the Railsbank CEO’s insistence internally that its API should be considered its UX — since developers are the startup’s end user — the secret sauce is that compliance has been baked in from the start. This sees all transactions that are initiated through the platform stay in line with compliance policy enforced through what Railsbank calls its unique “Compliance Firewall”.\n“For the first time the partner and/or customer’s compliance manual is live and active and not a PDF stuck in a drawer,” claims Verdon. “Every transaction (on-boarding, opening an account, receiving money, sending money, issuing a card, issuing credit etc.) has to pass through the Compliance Firewall and has to comply with compliance policy”.\nTo that end, the types of companies or fintech startups that could utilise Railsbank are far-ranging and Verdon says that every day the company is discovering new use-cases. (It offers a sandbox, including live account generation, to try out the platform.)\nOne example is a regulated investment company that needs modern API access to its banking. This could include creating accounts, receiving money, sending money etc, so that they can implement straight through processing.\nAnother is a lender that wants to offer a ‘banking lite’ current account to gain more data on an individual customer’s behaviour to lower the lending risk and possibly even the lending rates.\nOr perhaps an Amazon merchant who wants to sell on Amazon’s European stores but needs to demonstrate compliance controls to a banking partner. They could use Railsbank to show they only accept money from Amazon including surfacing Amazon Marketplace data (via Amazon’s API) on what goods were sold for each Amazon settlement.", "tags": "nigel-verdon,currencycloud,firestartr", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/railsbank/", "id": "1524683"}, {"title": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son says he wants to invest in either Uber or Lyft", "text": "SoftBank has been heavily linked with an investment in Uber in recent weeks, and today CEO Masayoshi Son confirmed his interest in pursuing a deal. However, in a twist, Son said that SoftBank is also considering buying into Uber’s arch-enemy in the U.S., Lyft, instead.\nSpeaking to investors following the announcement of SoftBank’s Q1 2017 earnings, Son was candid about SoftBank’s desire to back a horse in the U.S. ride-sharing space. While it is the largest investor in Didi Chuxing (China), Ola (India), Grab (Southeast Asia) and 99 (Latin America), it doesn’t yet have representation in North America.\n“We are interested in discussing with Uber, [but] we are also interested in discussing with Lyft,” Son said during a Q&A session. “We haven’t decided which way, but [the] U.S. is a very big market — it’s [the] most important market — so we are definitely very much interested in the U.S. market. Whether we decide to partner and invest into Uber or Lyft, I don’t know what will be the end result.”\nLyft recently hit one million rides per day, and its valuation is rising while Uber goes through a period of uncertainty without a CEO, but still its business is considerably smaller than Uber. Lyft closed $600 million in fresh funding at a $7.5 billion valuation in April, whereas Uber has been valued at over $60 billion. Its value is less certain now. Reports indicate, however, that SoftBank may do business at a lower valuation, and involve secondary share sales.\nFor all that talk it doesn’t appear that any kind of deal is on the table right now. Son himself said SoftBank is “exploring the idea and we would like to discuss with both companies.”\nThe idea of investing in Uber, which rivals Ola, Grab and 99 but was beaten by Didi in China, has surprised many, but throw in the fact that SoftBank is also weighing its rival and there’s likely to be further confusion over the motivation. However, Son explained that he sees ride-sharing as a key global industry that Softbank can ill-afford to miss out on.\n“This is the shared economy and one of the most important industries, I think the way people use the transportation and the lifestyle will be different from today [compared to in] 30 years [or] 50 years,” he explained.\n“The autonomous car is definitely coming, and when that stage comes, this ride-share business becomes even more important,” Son added.\nSoftBank’s ride-sharing ambition — which has been clear for some time — sits outside of its enormous Vision Fund, which is targeting a $100 billion total raise and also has stakes in huge global companies like ARM and Nvidia.\nSoftBank announced a first close of $93 billion for the fund in May, but revealed it will sit out ride-sharing deals due to conflicts of interest. That hasn’t stopped SoftBank from stepping up and financing billion-dollar funding rounds for Grab and Didi already this year, with other companies likely to be on the receiving end of additional financing.", "tags": "softbank", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/softbank-lyft-uber/", "id": "1524047"}, {"title": "In its push to compete in Southeast Asia, WeWork is pouring a (brand-new!) $500 million into the region", "text": "Less than two weeks ago, WeWork took the wraps off a new massive round of funding — $500 million from the Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital, the Japanese internet giant SoftBank, Greenland Holdings, and China Oceanwide.\nNow, the company is announcing that it’s pouring that exact amount — $500 million — into expanding into Southeast Asia and Korea. Interestingly, it says this $500 million is new and not the same capital, though it isn’t disclosing from where the money is coming.\nAs part of its announcement, WeWork says it has spent an undisclosed amount to acquire a 1.5-year-old, Singapore-based co-working company Spacemob. Spacemob’s founder and CEO, Turochas Fuad, will become managing director of Southeast Asia for WeWork. Spacemob’s roughly 20 employees will also join WeWork.\nSpaceMob had raised just $5.5 million in seed funding from Alpha JWC Ventures and Vertex Ventures in November of last year. Rather than a big, splashy acquisition, it more or less represents the same, promising but smaller scale business that WeWork has acquired in the past.\nWeWork’s few previous acquisitions to date include Fieldlens, a mobile communication system for the construction industry that WeWork bought in June; Welkio, a digital sign-in system for guests at an office that it purchased last year; and Case, a building information modeling and consultancy firm that WeWork acquired in 2015. WeWork hasn’t disclosed financial terms for any of these deals.\nThe amount of money that WeWork has raised this year is astonishing. In addition to the $1 billion it has announced in the last two weeks, a Delaware filing had surfaced in June, showing that WeWork had closed on $760 million in separate funding. WeWork also raised $300 million in March.\nThe company was reportedly valued at $20 billion as of two weeks ago. It isn’t clear whether its newest capital injection changes that number.\nGiven the fractured but growing competition that WeWork is facing in these newer markets, its aggressive push isn’t surprising. Just last month, URWork, a two-year-old, Beijing-based co-working business in China modeled largely WeWork, raised $30 million in fresh funding that brings its total funding to date to $175 million altogether.\nIt’s also in a race with Naked Hub, a company that started out in resorts and has moved into co-working across China to become a key rival. Naked Hub recently moved into Southeast Asia with an acquisition of its own, and it is raising $200 million for growth.\nWeWork already has locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Bangalore. Zeroing in on Singapore also makes sense given the sky-high rates that startups must pay for offices, which rank among the highest in the world.\nThe company’s newest $500 million round is just the latest of three significant rounds it has raised so far in 2017. In June, a Delaware filing surfaced that showed WeWork had closed on $760 million in new funding in June. WeWork had also raised $300 million in March. The company is now valued at $20 billion.\nIn addition to SoftBank, Hony Capital, Greenland Holdings, and China Oceanwide, WeWork’s investors include Benchmark, Aleph, Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Legend Holdings, T.

Honda issued on a recall on the model due to faulty part, but Uber continued to buy affected models and lease them to drivers without first fixing the issue. In one case, an Uber car caught fire but fortunately neither the driver nor any passengers were in it at the time, the Journal reported.\nCentral to the problem, Uber opted to buy its cars from auto importers rather than licensed dealers once it had exhausted local used-car dealer supplies, a move that the Journal said was made to save on spending. Uber’s importers, which operate in a legal grey area, didn’t fix the affected Vezel vehicles due to an apparent shortage of parts and Honda wasn’t obligated to do so, but Uber kept the vehicles on the road while it waited in order to avoid a negative reaction.\nThe Journal said one senior Uber Singapore executive described a possible recall, which would have left affected drivers without their vehicle since there was no immediate fix, as an event that would “send panic alarm bells to the mass market.”\nEventually, Uber did request drivers of affected Vezels to take their vehicle to a repair shop to get the faulty part deactivated, a move that it believed would reduce the potential for danger but one that was not approved by Honda itself.

Xiaomi has a wide range of products that are priced competitively and feature heart-rate monitors and alerts — the Mi Band is priced as low as $14.99 in the U.S. — while the Apple Watch, at upwards of $269, is a more premium approach that’s packed with a fuller set of features.

Gobee previously raised a pre-launch seed round led by Swiss Founders Fund.\nThe service is much like Ofo, Mobike, Obike and others in that it provides bicycles which are rented via a smartphone app that scans the bike’s QR code to unlock it. Each one contains a GPS chip which means it can be dropped off at and rented from any location.\nGobee was founded in February by Raphael Cohen (CEO) and Claude Ducharme (CTO), before going live in Hong Kong in April with a few initial hiccups. Cohen, who co-founded Hotel Quickly and was formerly with Rocket Internet’s FoodPanda business, said it has accrued over 100,000 downloads to date and currently offers “thousands” of bikes.\nDescribing Hong Kong as its “proof of concept” market, Cohen said the plan is to expand the service into North America, Europe and other parts of Asia. He didn’t provide specific details of expansion markets, but said that Gobee already has people on ground in “several” global cities.

Both are targeting 100 cities worldwide before the year is out, and have already hit the UK and Singapore as initial forays into new territories gets underway.\nCohen admitted that the colossal size of these rivals is a concern for Gobee, but he believes that they have bitten off more than they can chew. His theory is that the sheer scale of their ambition — and the importance of the Chinese market — will leave the door open for nimble players to pick up the bike-sharing baton in places like Europe and North America.\n“They are very focused on China, which is the world’s biggest market for bike-sharing, but they have a lot still to do there with only about 10-20 percent of the market potential unlocked,” he said. “But it seems like they not putting as much attention as they should. As has happened with other Chinese companies, they start expanding abroad and lose their focus on China, where new players came in and took marketshare.”\nGobee isn’t looking to make a move on China, but it is betting that the big players will ultimately divert their attention back to their homeland, leaving their global expansions deprioritized and weakened.\nThat’s quite a risk given the backing that Ofo and Mobike have received, in terms of sheer financial numbers and major tech names, but Gobee’s global push is also contingent on overseas markets taking to bike-sharing.

That’s because Paytm, the $8 billion-valued company behind the country’s top digital wallet, is in the process of expanding its services into person-to-person communication, games and other mobile content.\nThe planned update, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will go live in a beta feature that will ship to users before the end of August, a source with knowledge of the plans told TechCrunch.\nPaytm declined to comment.\nThe Paytm app will start out mimicking WhatsApp with chat app features including text, image, video and audio messaging, but it plans to go beyond the basics to integrate more sophisticated features. The model is something along the lines of WeChat in China, which today covers media, payments, ride-hailing, commerce and much more.\nOnce the initial messaging beta version is live, Paytm will begin working to include WeChat-like communications channels, which are essentially official accounts that allow brands to connect with users, and mobile games and other content. That could allow brands and Paytm merchants to market goods directly to users, and receive digital payment for them without the need for a face-to-face interaction.\nThis mobile push goes some way to explaining the recent joint venture that the India company created with Alibaba affiliate AGTech Media.\nWhat’s particularly interesting about Paytm’s mobile strategy is that parent company One97 Communication has a history in this space. It started out producing mobile content before it unearthed a mobile payments business and span it out. Another factor: Paytm’s largest shareholder is Alibaba is keen on exploring messaging after it totally missed the opportumity in China. Today its rival Tencent dominates the space with WeChat, which is encroaching on Alibaba’s core payment and commerce businesses.\nAlibaba has tried to integrate social features into its Alipay service, China’s dominant digital payment app, but with little to no success to date. You can be sure that the Chinese company has had influence on shaping Paytm’s move into messaging.\nNow comes the significance part. Paytm currently claims 230 million registered users. While most media have reported that this is larger than WhatsApp’s 200 million monthly users in India, it isn’t since Paytm’s active userbase stands at 54 million as of July, according to the source.\nNonetheless, there’s a clear crossover here with WhatsApp. The Facebook-owned company is widely believed to have selected India as the market where it will integrate mobile payments — reportedly using the government’s payment system — which would see it tread on Paytm’s turf, although it is still yet to make a move. Hike, meanwhile, a chat app unicorn backed by Tencent, was the first to move into messaging payments in June. But its app doesn’t boast the same widespread adoption as WhatsApp or Paytm, which has hindered the impact of its new feature.\nPaytm’s business has rocketed over the past year, primarily thanks to the impact of demonetisation, which saw 500 INR and 1,000 INR notes recalled and spurred digital payments in India. The policy helped the number of Paytm wallets jump from 135 million in August to 177 million by the end of December, while offline transactions went from being 15 percent of its volumes to 65 percent.\nGrowth is still coming — our source said Paytm processed $1 billion in GMV in India in July — but the company is looking to expand its appeal and engagement with users by moving into messaging and content. (There’s also the potential to make money from social games, as chat app Line showed with $1 billion in revenue last year.) The ultimate goal, TechCrunch understands, is to reach 100 million monthly active Paytm users by end of the current Indian business year — that’s a deadline of April 1 2018.\nBeyond payments, Paytm also operates an e-commerce service and is planning to enter the digital banking space.\nThat spread of interests has given hope to rivals like MobiKwik, which is raising new funding at a $1 billion valuation. Co-founder Upasana Taku recently told TechCrunch that she believes Paytm is over-extending itself, leaving its core payment business liable to disruption.

The 6-inch AMOLED display on the larger XL model will be provided by LG, per reports, and the smaller device will be more of an entry-level offering when compared to last year, where they were basically indistinguishable save for their size.\nThat smaller Pixel gen 2 device will have thicker bezels than its larger sibling, and a 4.97-inch 1080p display, per reports. One notable change could be front-facing speakers, which would improve sound quality. It’ll also reportedly have ‘squeezable’ sides, which will activate Google Assistant when pressed.\nOther rumored tech specs include a report that it’ll have 4GB of RAM on board, and that internal storage might get a boost to 64GB. The camera will get some upgrades, potentially due largely to software, and another rumor suggests it might drop the headphone port which it actually highlighted as a feature differentiator vs. the iPhone last time around.\nGoogle revealed last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL at an event on October 4, so it’s very likely the October 5 date is spot on. With the Galaxy S8, the Note 8 and the Essential Phone, the Android device market on the premium end has changed considerably, however, so we’ll see what Google does with the Pixel to help it continue to stand out.", "tags": "qualcomm,google-pixel", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/googles-next-pixel-smartphone-rumored-for-october-5-debut/", "id": "1531525"}, {"title": "Putting the voice assistant speaker craze in context", "text": "If you believe the hype, homes in the US are already lousy with speakers containing embodied AI — the most high profile being Amazon’s Echo, in its various incarnations, whose Alexa voice assistant can be commanded to do things like play music, answer trivia questions or tap into third party apps (via an ever-expanding set of so-called ‘skills‘).\nBut the truth is these virtual personal assistant (VPA) speakers remain very much the domestic exception, not the rule. To give an idea of current and near-term market size, a snapshot forecast put out by Gartner yesterday suggests these VPA-enabled wireless speakers will generate just $3.52BN in global revenue by 2021, up from $0.72BN in 2016.\nGartner tells TechCrunch the forecast is based on estimates of unit sales of between 10-12 million AI speaker devices shipping this year. (Amazon and other makers playing in this space, such as Alphabet with its Google Home speaker, don’t disclose official sales figures.)\nFor some comparative context, Gartner is expecting the wearables space to generate $30.5BN in revenue this year, off of 310M devices shipped. While the global smartphone market ships more units than a year’s worth of wearables per quarter (~380M) — and more than a billion handsets per year (~1.5BN in 2016).\nStill, AI-enabled speakers are definitely having their moment in the sun, as even Apple has decided it’s time to get involved — announcing earlier this summer its own premium offering is on the way. Aka, the HomePod.\n“We want to reinvent home music,” was how Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the gadget at the company’s WWDC keynote, showing how Cupertino is thinking about the emergent device within its own business context. Music first, AI last.\nGiven the evident disconnect between the level of noise being generated by Echo et al, and still very low-level consumer appetite for buying and living with yet another high-tech gizmo — not to mention one that can suck up so much personal data — Apple’s positioning of HomePod as first and foremost a high end audio device makes perfect mainstream market sense.\nApple’s Siri-based voice control — which, in any case, has lagged behind competing voice assistant techs — is being presented as a secondary extra. And that’s not going to be a problem for the company’s target consumer.\nThe existing Bluetooth wireless speakers market, i.e. speakers that don’t include AI assistants, is clearly orders of magnitude larger, though it’s also at a different stage of development. But one is a proven market; the other is still experimental.\nExperimenting with new touchpoint to embed their AIs is certainly the name of the game for Amazon and Google, whose business models focus on driving services revenue streams, rather than trying to make a fat profit on hardware itself.\n“If you’re looking at just music, and you’re looking at a dedicated device for that, that’s where the market is at the moment — there’s no doubt,” agrees Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal. “This is music plus,” he says of VPA wireless speakers. “And then you get music plus screen, and you get music plus camera… We’re still seeing them evolve, as to what use-cases they can start fitting into.”\n“At the moment [these devices are not that] convenient [for consumers to use]. It’s a little bit hard because it maybe doesn’t understand you… They’re putting them out there so they can get more data, learn more about what people are doing to make the experience better,” he adds. “And that’s the tough part for consumers; because what they’re getting at the moment from a hardware perspective is fine… From an experience perspective it learns. And I think that’s something that users will have to get used to or understand over time. That the device, actually, is getting cleverer as they hold onto it.”\nFor Amazon, the family of Echos it’s busily building out (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show… ) means all the more virtual, voice-enabled ecommerce touchpoints — so more opportunities to reach new users and get existing users to buy and subscribe to more of its services.\nIt’s clear that measuring success in this category will not be so tightly tied to hardware volumes shipped. The bigger story is whether these devices can significantly drive the kinds of digital services Amazon, Google et al want in perpetual reach across consumers’ home — keeping their users transacting even when they’re not actively using a smartphone or laptop.\n“Whilst the volumes aren’t going to be necessary big, from a hardware perspective, it’s interesting to see the approaches of the vendors in this space,” agrees Atwal. “It’s not like the smartphone market where everybody needs to sell hardware. It’s different approaches that end up with a speaker but there’s a different reason and business model behind it.”\nThere are also going to be more types of hardware bodies housing AIs in future. Gartner is projecting a temporary slowdown in sales of VPA wireless speakers next year because it expects other types of devices to have virtual assistants baked in — especially in “connected home scenarios” — citing devices like lighting systems, hubs and wi-fi mesh devices.\nSo the long view here is that voice control gets embedded into everything in the home. Or at least every device or thing where it makes sense.\n“Do you want to be talking to your fridge? You probably do, if you open it up and your milk’s about to finish you might actually want to say to your fridge — order me some more milk or put it on my list,” he suggests. “It’s that one to one interaction — I know you’re talking to a piece of metal or a machine — but it’s that convenience level that will slowly but surely people will get comfortable.”\nAtwal predicts the smart home may end up comprising a mix of voice-driven interactions plus button-presses to give some rudimentary online abilities to other things — citing another Amazon device, its Dash buttons, which can be stuck next to things like your washing machine or underwear drawer and used as a low friction route to reorder a particular item the moment you realize you’ve run out of soap powder or clean pants.\n“It’s going to be a combination of those voice-driven, automated capabilities that will drive how this comes together,” argues Atwal of the smart home. Though its voice that has the really big potential here, if AI can deliver on its potential.\n“As voice becomes more of a natural interaction, and conversational, then as it understands the conversation that you’re having with it — I think that’s really where the voice is going to really provide a difference,” he says. “That’s where it will start to hold its own over time, where it can hold a conversation where it remembers what you said previously and puts that in the context of whatever you say next so you’re not repeating the subject matter… so it becomes like you’re having a conversation with a human.”\nOf course the current crop of voice-driven devices are nowhere near being able to sustain such sophisticated, contextual human-esque conversations. So while that’s the clear ambition, it’s less evident when (or if) such a breakthrough interface might show its voice.\n“That’s somewhere in the future,” says Atwal, adding: “It’s not clear how quickly or otherwise that will come around.”\nAnother aspect of the smart speaker craze that Gartner discusses in its forecast is privacy considerations — which it recognizes may be preventing some consumers from feeling comfortable installing a listening device linked to a data-harvesting commercial entity inside their homes.\nAnd while its forecast takes the view that consumers’ concerns about privacy will have been “largely” mitigated by 2020 — on account of what it describes as “educational efforts, adoption by peers and regulatory approvals of the device category” — Atwal rows back on this line somewhat.\nHe says that while various technical and regulatory aspects can be deployed to give the user more “capabilities around privacy” — such as authenticating and identifying who’s talking to a device; and regulating how you register devices in terms of who’s using them and what data flows — in his view there’s still likely to be a “battle” against perceptions of the tech being seen as inherently creepy.\n“There’s various ways from a technical or regulatory perspective [device makers] can give the user more capabilities around privacy. But whether the perception for the user around privacy changes, given its voice, and sits in your home and listens, that’s still [a questionmark],” he tells TechCrunch. “Whether the user perception changes over that time is going to be a battle.”\nAnother Gartner prediction for the space is that beginning in 2019, third-gen VPA speaker products will start shipping with some AI functions running locally on the device, rather than in the cloud — and it says this is, in part, also a consequence of privacy considerations.\nOther drivers here include latency and resilience against network downtime.\n“Many customers, especially future enterprise clients, require on-premises solutions, in some cases mandated by confidentiality and regulatory requirements,” notes Gartner research director Werner Goertz.\n“Privacy, latency, getting things done quicker,” adds Atwal on this. “You don’t need to go back to the cloud to consult up there — there a lot of things that can be done locally because, actually, it’s just to do with you. You don’t need to go off and find out what everybody else is doing to come back and tell you what you want to do.\n“So over time… that latency and speed and getting that done has to start happening at a more local level. And again I use two words: one is convenience, and secondly experience. As you get more of a local level technological input that ultimately would have to make that experience better.”", "tags": "amazon-alexa,amazon-echo,alexa,amazon-com", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/putting-the-voice-assistant-speaker-craze-in-context/", "id": "1531439"}, {"title": "Global wearables market to grow 17% in 2017, 310M devices sold, $30.5BN revenue: Gartner", "text": "Analyst Gartner is expecting to see growth of 16.7 per cent, year-over-year, across the global wearables market this year, which encompasses a variety of device types and form factors — from smartwatches to body-worn cameras and even head-mounted displays.\nIts forecast projects sales of 310.4M wearable devices worldwide this year, generating a total of $30.5BN in revenue — of which it expects $9.3BN to come from the smartwatch category specifically, where the Apple Watch currently leads over rivals like Samsung’s Gear smartwatch.\nApple is expected to announce a new model of its smartwatch this September — adding direct cellular connectivity and meaning the Apple Watch will be able to support using its Siri voice assistant, messaging and transferring sensor data without needing an iPhone in close proximity — thereby expanding its utility and potentially giving the product’s prospects with consumers a boost.\nThe company does not break out unit sales of the Watch, but reporting its latest earnings earlier this month CEO Tim Cook said sales of the wearable were up 50 per cent, year-over-year. (Apple reports earnings for Watch within an ‘other products’ category — which also includes the likes of Apple TVs, Beats electronics devices, iPods and Apple-branded accessories — and the category as a whole earned it $2.74BN in its last quarter.)\nGartner says it expects a total of 41.5M smartwatches to be sold this year, adding that the device type is “on pace” to account for the highest unit sales of all wearable form factors from 2019 to 2021, with the exception of Bluetooth headsets.\n\nBy 2021, Gartner estimates that sales of smartwatches will total nearly 81M units — representing 16 per cent of total wearable device sales, according to its forecast.\nIt notes that smartwatch revenue is bolstered by the relatively stable average selling prices (ASPs) of Apple Watch — a wrist-mounted wearable whose entry price starts at $269.\n“The overall ASP of the smartwatch category will drop from $223.25 in 2017 to $214.99 in 2021 as higher volumes lead to slight reductions in manufacturing and component costs, but strong brands such as Apple and Fossil will keep pricing consistent with price bands of traditional watches,” noted Gartner research director, Angela McIntyre, in a statement.\nWhile expecting Apple to continue to lead the smartwatch category, Gartner predicts Cupertino’s share will decline in the coming years — dropping from approximately a third in 2016 to a quarter in 2021 — as more providers enter the market. (Though other brands, such as Asus, Huawei, LG, Samsung and Sony, will still have a lower share — it’s expecting they will account for only 15 per cent in 2021.)\nInterestingly, smartphones for children is a sub-category that Gartner’s expecting to perform well — representing 30 per cent of total smartwatch unit shipments in 2021, according to its calculations.\nThese are wearables aimed at children in the two to 13 year-old range, with makers targeting parents who don’t yet want their child to have a fully fledged smartphone.\nThe analyst also expects uplift in the traditional watch brand/luxury/fashion smartwatch segment — which it forecasts accounting for 25 percent of smartwatch units by 2021 — as long-standing brands attempt to attract younger customers.\nMeanwhile, startup and while-label smartwatch brands, such as Archos, Cogito, Compal, Martian, Omate and Quanta, which will account for five per cent of unit sales in 2021.\nElsewhere in the wearables space, Bluetooth headsets will remain the biggest sub-category, accounting for almost half (48 per cent) of all wearables sold in 2017. The analyst also expects the audio devices to continue to be the most sold type of wearables through 2021, when it projects sales of 206M.\nGrowth here is being driven by the elimination of the headphone jack by “major smartphone providers”, according to Gartner. And while Apple kicked off that shift — and does of course have a pair of Bluetooth-powered, Siri-primed, premium-priced wireless earbuds to sell you instead (AirPods) — the analyst’s assumption is that by 2021 almost all premium mobile phones will no longer have the 3.5 mm jack. RIP trusty old pairs of headphones the world over.\nMeanwhile, one of the tiddler technologies of today’s wearable market — head-mount displays (HMDs) which support augmented reality applications that do not fully block the wearer’s vision (as a full VR headset does) — will continue to be a small player through the next five or so years, according to the analyst.\nGartner forecasts that HMDs will account for just 7 per cent of all wearable devices shipped this year, and says they will not reach mainstream adoption with consumers or industrial customers through 2021. (Which amounts to a bearish view on AR startup Magic Leap‘s near-term prospects — the company still doesn’t have a wearable in the market, though its founder has hinted one could be coming this year.)\nNear-term opportunities for HMDs that Gartner points to include: for video game players; for various industrial and business use-cases such as for workers performing equipment repair, inspections and maintenance, or to help with manufacturing, training, design and customer interactions; as well as for entertainment use-cases such as in theme parks, theaters and sports venues, to enhance an experience or provide supplementary information.\n“Current low adoption by mainstream consumers shows that the market is still in its infancy, not that it lacks longer-term potential,” added McIntyre of HMDs.", "tags": "wearables,wearable-technology,gartner,wearable-devices", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/global-wearables-market-to-grow-17-in-2017-310m-devices-sold-30-5bn-revenue-gartner/", "id": "1530901"}, {"title": "Apple could announce the next iPhone on September 12", "text": "Mark down September 12 in your calendar as Apple could be unveiling the next iPhone at 9 AM on that day.

But new hardware from Astropad, the maker of the popular iPad app that you can use to turn your tablet into a drawing tablet, has finally convinced me that high quality, easy and reliable wireless external display tech is within reach, and actually set to be available very soon to consumers thanks to a new Kickstarter project.\nLuna Display is a tiny dongle, not much bigger than the average thumb nail, which plugs into either your computer’s Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt, too) or a USB-C or USB 3 (two models will be available) port on modern Macs. The dongle then works with an app on your iPad, connecting using your Wi-Fi network to transfer data between the two.\nWhy the dongle? Other apps, including Astropad itself, have extended the Mac’s display using Wi-Fi before, after all. The reason is simple: access to your Mac’s graphics card. The dongle can tap into the full hardware graphics acceleration capabilities of the Mac to which its attached, delivering benefits software hacks can’t match, including Metal GPU support. That allows for a very high quality image, with true Retinal support and reliability across visual media types – video included.\nThe media prototype I received doesn’t have the final fit and finish of the planned production version, but it definitely works like a charm. I’ve long been a user of an iPad as a second display, typically employing the software of Astropad competitor Duet Display and using a wired connection to achieve the results I want.\nWhat’s so amazing about Luna Display is that it offers better visual quality than Duet Display (which is still very good), despite not requiring a direct wired connection to work. The visual fidelity is frankly stunning considering you’re working with a completely untethered connection, and it’s good enough that you can watch YouTube and other videos very enjoyably.\nUsing the pre-release software and hardware, I did notice some very minor pixelation when moving window, or when viewing animated or video content. It’s not enough to detract from the experience, overall, and this is still an extremely beta version of the final Luna Display product, with software provided via Apple’s TestFlight pre-release provisioning service.\nMinor visual eccentricities aside, Luna Display also performs very well in terms of touch response and interaction, which is something that Mac users interested in touchscreen notebooks have been looking for since it became the norm on PC rivals. Pinch to zoom, scrolling and even Apple Pencil support are all available here, and all work very well – better than I’d hoped to imagine they would. Astropad also says the features of its original app, tailored for graphics professionals, will eventually be available via Luna Display as well.\nThis is really a travel and portability lifesaver in terms of external display solutions, especially if what you’re aiming for isn’t just a purely functional secondary display, but a quality Retina-capable additional monitor with faithful color rendering. The current iPad Pro is a powerhouse in these areas, and being able to quickly and easily employ it as a portable add-on display, which you can also use as effectively a touch-capable Mac in a pinch, is a true game changer.\n\nLuna Display is on Kickstarter now, with a $59 pledge nabbing you either a USB-C or a Mini DisplayPort dongle and delivery starting in May 2018.

The feature varies how long you can rewind by game, with a sliding scale ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on how fast the in-game action tends to happen, but it sounds like it’s a thoughtful feature implemented intelligently by Nintendo. Skip to the 2:15 mark in the video below (via Eurogamer) to see the rewind feature in action.\nThe SNES Classic Edition ships with 21 games installed, including the unreleased sequel to StarFox. The suspend points themselves are super useful for this era, since they give you the ability to quickly and instantly save your progress instead of relying on in-game progress markers, but the rewind feature should mean nostalgic gamers can tackle even points in play that have long frustrated them.\nThen again, maybe this just yet another example of how millennials have everything too easy and never had to deal with the kind of challenges that built character for Generation X and Xennials.", "tags": "nintendo,gaming,computing", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/nintendos-snes-classic-mini-will-let-you-rewind-games-to-tackle-tricky-spots/", "id": "1530283"}, {"title": "Pepper the robot can perform funerary rites, but it shouldn’t", "text": "It’s not really clear just what “humanoid” robots are actually for.

Really?\nThis week is ENDEX, the Tokyo International Funeral and Cemetery Show and Life Ending Industry Expo — which, sure, isn’t for everyone, but honestly is a very important industry and one in which technology plays an increasing role.\nBut while I can get behind the idea of robotic grave cleaners, epitaph etchers, urn retrievers and things along those lines, this seems like a step in the wrong direction.\nAccording to the Japan Times, “Kanagawa-based Nissei Eco Co. will offer Pepper — billed as the world’s first robot that can read emotions — to chant Buddhist sutras at funerals, providing a cheaper alternative to human priests.”\n(Just as a quick aside, I don’t buy that Pepper actually reads emotions — no robot or computer vision system can do that. Hell, neither can I most of the time.)\nIt’s meant to help bring down the costs of funerary services in Japan, where (as elsewhere) they can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. And a real monk would be doing the main part, while Pepper would just be doing the backup sutras.

Interactive Robogami is a project from MIT that lets users create ambulatory robots from a library of pieces that fold and fit together like origami.\n“The goal is to make the process of designing robots accessible,” said Adriana Schulz, a PhD student at MIT who co-led the project. “The actuators, the materials, the code, things like that require a lot of knowledge. Our system encapsulates that expert knowledge, so the user can focus on conceptual design.”\nRobogami lets users combine a library of intercompatible parts with primitives that can be printed like puzzle pieces and then folded and locked into shape. The flat-printed style reduces both print time and material cost by more than half.\nIt has a user-friendly GUI that has more in common with a game or 3D doodle app than a CAD or other design environment. You drag the pieces where you want them, arrange the type and placement of the feet or wheels and add any other features you think might be useful (or cool-looking). Then you can work out how and when those parts will move, what direction and so on.\nMeanwhile, the app is doing all kinds of calculations in the background.\n“One of the key things is that you can design geometry and motion at the same time. Normally that’s two different processes, but here you can change one and see how it affects the other,” said Schulz.\n“The ordering of the how the legs move, the speed, these are all parametric structures,” she said. How they interact is systematized and you don’t have to worry about, for example, synchronizing motor torques or timing a foot’s touchdown — it’s being calculated internally. “The software maps these components into a full fabrication plan, from the mesh that goes to the 3D printer to the motors and code, the user doesn’t have to worry — it’s very end to end.”\nFor instance, if you decide to move the front legs back toward the center, the software calculates how that might affect when and how fast they move, or whether their motion would interfere with another piece. It watches for things like wobbliness, changes in orientation and center of gravity.\nIt might sound a little like baby’s first robot kit, but it’s clearly a versatile tool. Robogami users of varying levels of familiarity with CAD and engineering tools took part in a handful of tests. “We were really surprised by the diversity of models people made,” Schulz told me. It took about 15-30 minutes to design a robot, a few hours to print it, then 30-90 minutes to assemble it.\nThe tool isn’t aimed at any population in particular, Schulz told me (other than “anybody”), but I thought this would make for an amazing couple of weeks in a high school or college engineering course, perhaps even earlier. Design your own little bots, print them overnight, assemble them to understand how the motors and chassis fit together, then race them or have them navigate obstacles.\n\nRight now Robogami is just the subject of the researchers’ paper, now published in the International Journal of Robotics Research. But Schulz said the goal was to move beyond mere locomotion and into other tasks. “Empowering people to design complex things is difficult! But I think it would be exciting to create tools that lower design barriers for casual users.”\n“These tools enable new approaches to teaching computational thinking and creating,” said Daniela Rus, director of MIT’s CSAIL and collaborator on the research, in a news release. “Students can not only learn by coding and making their own robots, but by bringing to life conceptual ideas about what their robots can actually do.”", "tags": "csail,mit", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/mits-robogami-lets-you-build-custom-3d-printable-robots-from-standard-folding-parts/", "id": "1529842"}, {"title": "Nintendo adds PayPal support to the Nintendo Switch", "text": "Nintendo has added a new payment option for eShop purchases on the Nintendo Switch and on its website.

(Disclosure: Verizon owns Oath, which owns TechCrunch.)\nAnd the biggest change is probably that mobile video is now capped at a maximum resolution of 480p. You won’t be able to stream any HD video on Netflix or YouTube with the basic unlimited plan (Update: video is capped at 480p on phones and 720p on tablets). Verizon has already run tests in July throttling Netflix and online video in general.\nInstead of acting as a dumb data pipe, Verizon is looking at what you’re doing with your phone and sending you data at a slower speed if you’re doing things that could cost Verizon a lot of money.\nVerizon launched an $80 unlimited data plan back in February. This previous plan was quite straightforward. You could do whatever you wanted with your phone until you reached 22GB of usage. After that, you would get reduced speeds. You could also use your phone as a hotspot for 10GB per month.\nBut this plan led to more pressure on the network and increased costs. So the company had to do something to turn this great consumer-friendly idea into a viable business venture.\nThe entry-level Go Unlimited plan is now $5 cheaper, but it also comes with a ton of restrictions. In addition to 480p video, you can experience reduced speeds at all times to reduce network congestion, even if you only use a couple of gigabytes per month. Of course, you can always upgrade to Beyond Unlimited if you’re too frustrated with those restrictions.\nEven worse, mobile hotspot speed is limited to 600kbps. The company says you get unlimited data when you’re tethering, but 600kbps is so slow that you’ll give up on tethering in no time. In fact, if you use mobile hotspot for an hour, you can only download around 260MB of data — it’s that slow.\nForget about YouTube. Even just loading nytimes.com completely, a 3.8MB page, would take you 51 seconds at full speed.\nYou can pay $10 more for the Beyond Unlimited plan ($85). This plan looks more or less like the old unlimited plan, with a 22GB limit. You can tether for up to 15GB per month. But videos are still capped at 720p on your phone and 1080p on your other devices. Existing customers will still pay $80 per month, but video will be throttled. How hard is it to let users decide what to do with their data allowance?\nIf you think other carriers are nicer, AT&T also has two different unlimited plans (“Unlimited Choice” and “Unlimited Plus”) with restrictions on video. T-Mobile’s basic unlimited plan also limits video to 480p. Sprint doesn’t limit video but throttles your speed when you’re streaming music.\nIn other words, rest in peace net neutrality. If only the FCC was courageous enough to prevent carriers from branding their plans as “unlimited” when those plans are nothing but unlimited…", "tags": "verizon-wireless,verizon", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/verizon-throttles-video-for-good-with-its-new-not-so-unlimited-unlimited-plan/", "id": "1529663"}, {"title": "New drone perches on walls like a robotic bird", "text": "The Multimodal Autonomous Drone (S-MAD) is a fixed-wing drone that has a few bird-like tricks up its sleeve. You can, for example, fly it like a glider through a room or open space, but when it approaches a flat surface the drone quickly changes configuration and lands flat with its little spiky teeth digging in to keep it from falling. In short, this is one of the scariest robotic behaviors I’ve seen since Big Dog galumphed its way into our nightmares.\nThe S-MAD uses something called microspines to attach itself to rough surfaces. The spines are essentially hardened steel spikes that grip small bumps in a surface from two directions — “the opposed-grip strategy for microspines is just like a human hand grasping a bottle of water, except that while humans require some macroscopic curvature to get our fingers around both sides of an object, the microspines can go deep into the micro-features of a rough surface and latch on those tiny bumps and pits,” said researcher Hao Jiang of Stanford. These spines are already being used on multi-rotor drones, but this is the first time they’ve been used on a fixed-wing device. The plane now lands on surfaces 100 percent of the time, an impressive feat for such a drone.\nWith these microspines, the plane can flatten itself against a wall and perch there, gathering data and scanning the environment. When it’s ready to move on, it releases the spines and flies off into the wild blue. Researchers Dino Mehanovic, John Bass, Thomas Courteau, David Rancourt and Alexis Lussier Desbiens from the University of Sherbrooke decided to connect these spines with a fixed-wing drone and had to create a new way to essentially stop the plane in mid-air — something birds are quite adept at — and settle on a surface. The system switches from plane to helicopter in a split second, allowing it to flatten against the wall instantly. From Spectrum:\nThis is obviously a proof of concept, but it could be used in situations where long-distance glides terminate in a permanent perch at some high point for data collection. After the data is collected, the plane can essentially fall off the surface and fly back by righting itself, climbing to altitude and gliding home.", "tags": "drone,airplane,music", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/new-drone-perches-on-walls-like-a-robotic-bird/", "id": "1529077"}, {"title": "These solar glass blocks would make great skylights for your solar roof", "text": "If you’re going to be decking your roof out with solar tiles, there’s a possibility that you may forgo what might be the best placement of a skylight in favor of more solar cell square footage. Luckily solar glass is fast becoming an option, and these clever glass blocks are the best option I’ve seen yet.\n\t\nResearchers at the University of Exeter thought up an interesting alternative that may be the best of both worlds (until the next breakthrough, anyway). They created these thick blocks of glass with optical features — not quite lenses or tunnels, but sort of light guides — that funnel light from a large area on the sunny side of the window onto a much smaller cell on the inside.\nBy concentrating the light onto a smaller point, you get considerably more energy out of the cell’s tiny surface area than if it were ordinarily illuminated. It won’t be as much as a full-on cell covering that amount of space, but at least it’s transparent! Apart from the little cells and the wires connecting them, of course, which actually make a rather cool-looking pattern.\nAnd because of their thickness, these Solar Squared units, as they’re called, even provide decent insulation.\nFree light, free power, and free thermal insulation — or free after it pays for itself, anyway. That could make it attractive to larger building designers, who are always looking to integrate energy-saving, green features like this into their work.\nSolar Squared is being spun off from the University as an independent business endeavor — a company called Build Solar.\nOf course you can’t order these things right now — it’s still a prototype and they’re waiting on the patent to go through.

This drone platform looks fairly basic – a custom multi-rotor drone with a chassis on the bottom to hold what looks like a stripped down machine gun, sniper rifle, or grenade launcher – but what it suggests about the future of warfare is pretty scary.\nA gimbal at the bottom of the drone holds the gun steady as you aim and fire remotely via a video-capable control pad. All of this is possible with current technology and there have been examples of this kind of tech over the years, most recently with the Switchblade project. The technology is basic – I suspect DJI or a similar drone manufacturer could build this in a weekend – but it’s the target market and marketing that is the most interesting.\n“TIKAD allows governments to utilize completely new capabilities against terrorist groups and reduce the number of deployed ground troops, and therefore, the number of casualties,” write TIKAD’s creators and they are currently raising funds to build more of these. In short, this viral video is essentially a massive marketing effort to support the company’s equity crowdfunding plan. After all, who doesn’t love a drone with a gun attached?\nDuke is saying they are currently in testing with the Israeli army and they are also doing a sort of online crowd sale for investment which is why they produced such a titillating video. Given the current state of drone technology a product like this would be dangerous for use in real situations but with a bit of engineering and improvement you could have something that could launch from a distant location, move in for the kill, and then fly back. It could also, like so many drones on the market, explode when it hits a tree.\nSo take TIKAD with a grain of salt.

The company has picked up Nanorep, a startup out of Israel that develops chatbots and other AI-based tools to help people navigate self-service apps.\nLogMeIn is paying $45 million plus up to $5 million more in earn-outs based on performance and employees staying put over the next two years.\nNanorep had raised just under $7 million from investors that included Titanium out of Russia (which had also backed Cloudyn, recently acquired by Microsoft), Oryzn Capital and OurCrowd.\nThe startup already had around 500 large customers, including big names like FedEx, Toys“R”Us and Vodafone. In essence, its platform helps anticipate what customers are trying to do when they’re on a website — say in a technical support or search situation — and reduces the number of steps needed to get there. It looks like all of Nanorep’s existing business will continue as its tech also gets integrated into Bold360.\nLogMeIn’s launch of Bold360 earlier this year was intended to help the company expand the range of services that it offered to customers, beyond authentication and IT management within an organisation, and into more cloud-based services where the business interfaces with its customers.\nHowever, the CRM space is already very crowded, and so it’s no surprise to see that LogMeIn has made an acquisition to add more features to the service to help set it apart from the pack.\nWith Nanorep, it’s also tapping into the recent enthusiasm and interest in AI and building “intelligent” services that mimic human behaviours, specifically in CRM.\n“Artificial intelligence is changing the way we interact with our favorite brands and will play a critical role in the future of customer engagement,” said Bill Wagner, CEO, LogMeIn, in a statement. “With Nanorep, we gain proven technology and AI expertise that expands our Bold360 offering, accelerates our customer engagement vision and provides a natural path for us to leverage these emerging technologies across our entire portfolio.

Today it’s Microsoft’s turn to launch a new container service for its Azure cloud computing platform: Azure Container Instances (ACI).\nThe company also today announced that it is joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation as a platinum member (that’s a $370,000/year commitment).\nWhile we’ve seen our fair share of container-centric services from the major cloud vendors, ACI is different from the likes of Azure’s existing Container Service, AWS’s EC2 Container Service and the Google Container Engine.\nACI, which is now in preview, is all about simplicity. It lets you spin up a single container with your choice of memory and CPU cores in a few seconds and usage is billed by the second. As Microsoft stresses, these containers are first-class objects on Azure and get all of the same role-based access controls, billing tags and other features that you’d expect on the platform. These containers are isolated from other customers using “proven virtualization technology,” Microsoft says.\nWhat you don’t get, however, is the hassle of having to manage VMs or learning about container orchestration. If you do want to use orchestration, though, you can do that with the help of Microsoft’s new open source Kubernetes connector. This allows Kubernetes clusters to deploy containers directly to ACI and lets developers mix and match VMs and ACI as needed.\n\nRight now, ACI only supports Linux containers but it will soon also support Windows Containers as well. Deploying a container only takes a single command with a few basic parameters and you can pull containers from public repositories like the Docker Hub or our private repositories on Azure.\nGiven its speed, the main use case of ACI is probably for bursty workloads and scaling. One of the main advantages of containers is that you can easily move them between services, so going from ACI to a more traditional VM-based container infrastructure shouldn’t be a problem.\n“This offers a level of agility for deploying Kubernetes, unlike any other cloud provider, enabling services that start in seconds without any underlying VMs and  are billed and scaled per second,” Corey Sanders, Microsoft’s Head of Product for Azure Compute, writes in today’s announcement.\n\nAs Sanders also announced today, Microsoft has decided to join the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a Platinum Member. The foundation hosts the Kubernetes project, as well as a growing number of other open source tools that help developers build, monitor and manage container-based applications. Other CNCF Platinum members include the likes of Cisco, CoreOS, Dell Technologies, Docker, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Joyent and RedHat. The CNCF is a Collaborative Project of the Linux Foundation — which Microsoft joined last year.\n“Cloud native technologies like Kubernetes enable better developer productivity, higher frequency deployments and more efficient utilization of computing resources,” Dan Kohn, Executive Director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, told me. “Active engagement by companies like Microsoft means that cloud native will increasingly be the standard way to deploy software both for new, greenfield applications and the standard platform for evolving existing monolithic applications into the cloud native future.”", "tags": "containers", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/microsofts-new-azure-container-instances-make-using-containers-fast-and-easy/", "id": "1519084"}, {"title": "OpenText acquires forensic security vendor Guidance Software for $240 million", "text": "OpenText, the content management company based in Waterloo, Ontario announced today that it was buying Guidance Software, a forensic security and eDiscovery vendor for $240 million.\nOpenText agreed to pay Guidance shareholders $7.10 a share.

As a case in point, just about a year ago, it bought Documentum, a competing enterprise content management firm, from EMC for $1.62 billion.\nThis acquisition gives the company some overlapping functionality too, but Cheryl McKinnon, an analyst with Forrester Research who monitors the content management industry, says it also gives the company forensics tools, which are new to them.\n“It certainly adds, with some overlap, to their eDiscovery and file analytics portfolio (i.e. , those tools to clean up network drives, detect sensitive text inside documents, etc.).

SimilarWeb — which offers analytics and insights about the performance of websites and apps, as well as competitive intelligence about how other apps and sites are doing (covering 80 million websites and three million apps across more than 190 countries in all) — is today announcing a significant fundraise of $47 million. Or Offer, SimilarWeb’s CEO, said the funding will be used to continue building out its analytics, business development and acquisitions.\nOffer and his CFO Jason Schwartz both said they would not comment on valuation. I understand that it is not quite double — but close to it — compared to the last round. The last round valued SimilarWeb at $400 million, so my educated guess is that this round has a post-money valuation approaching $800 million. “It’s getting close to being a unicorn,” a source close to the company said, referring to that $1 billion watermark that so many startups (or perhaps more their investors) are aiming to hit these days.\nSimilarWeb — co-headquartered in San Francisco and Israel — has already made three acquisitions to date, all to expand the kinds of data that it is able to ingest and analyze. For example, at the end of 2015 it acquired Quettra to move deeper into mobile app intelligence.\nThis latest round was led by Viola Growth, with participation also from Saban Ventures, CE Ventures, and other unnamed investors. (Previous backers include Naspers, which led its previous round of $25 million.) It brings the total raised by SimilarWeb to $112 million. \nSimilarWeb competes against the likes of Nielsen (and in the past, Alexa, before Amazon repurposed the name and business for its voice-based assistant). On the web, it provides data about how sites are performing, and offers comparative data for other sites; it also offers insights for mobile apps, where others providing mobile analytics include App Annie, Verto Analytics and Apptopia (among many others).\nIn the case of the competitive market insights, the “similar” of its name is a good product/branding fit, although it actually started as a different business: its first product iteration was as a Firefox plug-in that helped you find websites that you might like to visit that were “similar” to those you were already browsing.\nDespite the size of the competitive field, Offer says that SimilarWeb’s focus on deeper metrics — for example, engagement over basic traffic data — has meant that it provides businesses with a more unique set of data, and this has led to a rush of growth for the business. \n“Nielsen is still stuck in the TV age,” Offer said. “We have an amazing set of data in market research, focusing on areas like conversions and audience insights, and we think we have the data to disrupt the whole of the market research world, as old models die with the shift into digital.”\nToday, the company says that more than half of all Fortune 100 companies are using its products, along with “thousands” of other CMOs, investors, analysts, marketing agencies and consultants –customers include Google, eBay, Airbnb and Staples. No information provided on how many are using free versus paid versions of its platform (SimilarWeb is built on a freemium model, where you can use SimilarWeb’s own dashboard or implement its analytics by way of an API). \nThe reasons customers come to it, Offer said, are not just to help improve the performance of their own properties, but to figure out how to invest marketing budgets, how to develop their products, build bigger audiences and perhaps what acquisitions to make. \nSimilarWeb itself is taking a cue from that list to figure out how it will develop its business going forward.\nAs you might guess from his comments on disrupting market research, Offer noted that one area where SimilarWeb might do more in the future is consulting, where it not only provides intelligence and analytics data but also some insight into how that information can be used by the enterprise that has asked for it, to improve its business. In all, the market intelligence industry is worth some $68 billion, Offer said, so there is a lot of room to grow into adjacent areas.\n“We’re excited to lead the round and support SimilarWeb’s growth towards further establishing its presence as global leader in the market intelligence industry,” said Harel Beit-On, Founder and General Partner of Viola Growth, in a statement. “SimilarWeb empowers some of the most notable global brands to better understand, grow, and track their digital market share, fueling the rapid adoption of SimilarWeb’s platform globally.

Now the focus is on building solutions that the rest of the enterprise world can use, even if the business itself is not necessarily tech-centric.\nToday, an Israeli startup called Iguazio — which has built an “edge data” analytics platform targeting IoT, finance and other services that require real-time processing — is announcing that it has raised $33 million in funding to build out its service.\nWe understand from sources the company’s valuation is around $100 million.\nIguazio — a wordplay on Iguazu Falls, a reference to how big data is like a voluminous, fast-moving and complex waterfall — has been around since 2014, but has spent much of that time in stealth and closed beta.\nIt’s been a closely watched and fruitful period for the company. Iguazio has to date raised $48 million and it counts a number of its investors as beta users.\nThis latest Series B was led by Pitango Venture Capital, and others in the round included four strategic investors: Verizon Ventures, Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH (RBVC), trading platform CME Ventures and Dell Technologies Capital. Other previous investors (from its $15 million Series A when it was still in stealth) that participated in this round include Magma Venture Partners and Jerusalem Venture Partners (Dell was also in this first round, although that news was not made public at the time).\nEach strategic investor in this latest round points to verticals where Iguazio believes its business has the potential to develop, CEO and co-founder Asaf Somekh told me in an interview.\nVerizon Ventures is announcing its first investment in an Israeli startup since establishing a new operation in the country a few weeks ago; meanwhile, Verizon itself has been working on a new business unit for IoT and telematics (partly to offset competition and declining growth in fixed and consumer-mobile services). Bosch is one of the leaders in in-car systems. CME is building out its futures and options trading platforms to cover more and more data points. And Dell is, like many other hardware companies, looking for new revenue streams in services.\nAll four are using Iguazio’s platform in the development of their systems.\n“Our investors fit very well with our direction,” Somekh said. “We are engaged with all of our investors to some degree.” He added that while there are no revenues yet, for the last year and a half “we have been working with companies and are on the verge of the first generally available product that will come out in a matter of weeks.”\nThe idea behind what Iguazio is doing is that it’s trying to provide a platform for businesses to engage with big data analytics in a way that will actually produce results with minimal headaches.\nSomekh cites Gartner research that found that only one out of every 10 big data analytics projects in enterprises succeeds because of the lack of complexity and skills in the business to deploy and run them.\n“As one of the largest telecom companies in the world, we witness the importance of real-time continuous analytics and the way it has become crucial across businesses. Yet, there are not many existing scalable solutions,” said Merav Rotem-Naaman, Managing Director at Verizon Ventures Israel, in a statement.\n“Iguazio is aiming to become a trusted partner for companies looking to use data to make real-time business decisions that improve security and operations. IoT data that improves decision-making and transforms business must get analyzed closer to the edge, whether it be a fleet of trucks or the monetization of mobile usage.”\nWhile there are a lot of big data analytics services on the market today, Iguazio’s unique selling point is that it offers its services at the ‘edge’ — that is, close to the point where processing is taking place.\nFor services in areas like the Internet of Things, this is an essential component of how these networks will develop: cloud-based processing can become too costly when you have a vast network of end points, and at the same time, the end points themselves do not necessarily have the processing power to crunch their own numbers, let alone those of other end points from across the rest of the network.\nEdge computing is an area that a number of other companies are looking at to offload some of the processing from the origination point and the cloud. Recall Cisco and IBM’s deal last year to integrate IBM’s Watson AI analytics into Cisco’s edge routers. Others in the same area as Iguazio include the startup MapR, which already has products out in the market and today — possibly coincidentally, possibly on purpose to coincide with Iguazio’s news — rolled out a new program where systems integrators can work with MapR enterprises on big data deployments.\nIguazio’s approach — providing a platform that makes using big data analytics simple for any kind of business, whether technical or not — falls in line with another trend that we’ve been noticing. If areas like big data analytics and artificial intelligence represent the next wave of computing, there has been a rush of startups coming out of the gates that are focusing on building ways to make that next wave more accessible.\nOthers in this vein include LiveStories, which is building a data ingestion, analytics, and visualization platform specifically aimed at civic organizations that might otherwise lack the in-house ability to do this kind of work themselves. Element AI, meanwhile, is ambitiously building an “incubator” aimed at both smaller startups that touch one of the many aspects of AI, and enterprises that want to have better access to that tech, to help them meet somewhere in the middle. Like Iguazio, both have raised funding in recent weeks to build out their services to meet demand.\nNotably, the founding team at Iguazio have a strong history when it comes to building tech companies and exiting them. Another co-founder is Yaron Segev, who started and ran flash storage company XtremIO, which sold in 2012 for $430 million to data storage giant EMC. (Dell’s investment here comes via the EMC connection.)\n“Iguazio’s team has an outstanding track record of innovation and execution and we are delighted to back these stellar managers once again,” said Eyal Niv, Managing General Partner at Pitango, in a statement. “While the majority of big data deployments fail due to over complexity, iguazio’s platform has proven to be simple, fast and secure, making it exceptional for artificial intelligence and machine learning use cases. We’ve already received overwhelming feedback from beta customers generating actionable real-time insights with significant business impact.”", "tags": "pitango-venture-capital,iguazio,edge-computing,big-data", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/iguazio-nabs-33m-to-bring-big-data-analytics-to-iot-finance-and-other-enterprises/", "id": "1518461"}, {"title": "BentoBox, the website builder for restauranteurs, cooks up $4.8M Series A", "text": "Restaurant owners have a lot of responsibilities and a wide array of skills to handle those responsibilities.

Operating income was $7.0 billion non-GAAP.\nWall Street expected revenues of around $24.3 billion, which was pretty aggressive to begin with given that this called for a 7 percent year-over-year growth. As for earnings per share, Wall Street’s crystal ball readers called for $0.71 — or a 3 percent year-over-year growth.\nClearly, Wall Street didn’t do a good job with its predictions, but Microsoft had a great quarter. Unsurprisingly, its stock is up after the earnings release.\nAs usual, all eyes are on how Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform performed. While Azure’s growth has slowed down a tiny bit over the last few quarters (and we’re still talking close to 100 percent annual growth), it’s one of the main drivers of Microsoft’s top-line growth. In the last quarter, Microsoft reported $6.8 billion in revenue for its “Intelligent Cloud” business (which includes more than just Azure) and said its annual cloud run rate was $15.2 billion. This quarter, this area delivered revenues of $7.4 billion (up 11 percent from last year) and the commercial cloud annualized run rate is now up to 18.9 billion.\n\n“Innovation across our cloud platforms drove strong results this quarter,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft, in a canned statement. “Customers are looking to Microsoft and our thriving partner ecosystem to accelerate their own digital transformations and to unlock new opportunity in this era of intelligent cloud and intelligent edge.”\nAdditional highlights here are a 15 percent growth in server products and cloud services and Azure growing at a more than healthy 97 percent year-over-year (with Azure compute usage also doubling from last year).\nMicrosoft also said that its installed base for its Enterprise Mobility product has now hit more than 50 million.\nMicrosoft’s gross margins in this area also got a healthy boost. After the release, Stephanie Rodriguez, Microsoft’s Director of Investor Relations, told me that that she sees two drivers for this: the introduction and customer adoption of higher-value services and Microsoft’s ability to improve its own efficiencies as its product portfolio gains scale. “This was a really big quarter for us in terms of our commercial base,” she told me. “What we saw was increased customer commitment to commercial cloud and really great renewals.”\nIn the last quarter, Microsoft’s More Personal Computing segment took a hit because the company sold significantly fewer Surface devices than in previous quarters. Over the last few months, Microsoft launched a number of new devices, including a new Surface Pro and its first real laptop. These didn’t go on sale until late in the quarter, though. Analysts expected about $8.61 billion in sales for this segment and Microsoft delivered $8.8 billion, down 2 percent.\nThe reason for this, Microsoft argues, is lower phone revenue (“phone revenue was immaterial and declined $361 million,” Microsoft writes), though this was offset by growth in search, Windows and gaming revenue. The number of Xbox Live active users is holding steady at about 53 million and search revenue grew 10 percent year-over-year (likely driven by the integration of Bing into Windows 10).\nOffice 365 and the rest of Microsoft’s productivity tools have also long been a fast-growing segment for the company. This quarter, Microsoft reported revenue of $8.4 billion (up 21 percent) for this area. In our conversation, Rodriguez noted that Office 365 now also has 27 million customers on the consumer side.\nLinkedIn revenue was also up in the last quarter and went from $975 million in Q3 to $1.065 billion in the last quarter.", "tags": "earnings", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/20/microsoft-earnings-beat-expectations-thanks-to-strong-cloud-performance/", "id": "1516981"}, {"title": "Google Cloud gets a new networking algorithm that boosts internet throughput", "text": "Google today announced that TCP BBR, a new congestion-control algorithm that it has used to improve network throughput from google.com and YouTube by about four percent globally (and by more than 14 percent in some countries), is now also available to its Cloud Platform users.\nThe general idea here is to improve on the existing congestion-control algorithms for internet traffic, which have been around since the 1980s and which typically only take packet loss into account (when networking buffers fill up, routers will discard any new packets). These algorithms decide how fast a given device should be sending data into the network to avoid overloading it. When these systems realize that some of the data packets don’t make it to their final destination, they start sending the data more slowly, which ideally reduces the amount of congestion. There are all kinds of algorithms for working out the details of how exactly to do this (and how to speed up again over time), but at their core, they all tend to follow the same patterns.\n\nBBR, which stands for “Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time,” takes a different approach. It doesn’t just look at packet loss but also at how fast the network is actually delivering data. “For a given network connection, it uses recent measurements of the network’s delivery rate and round-trip time to build an explicit model that includes both the maximum recent bandwidth available to that connection, and its minimum recent round-trip delay,” Google explains. Using this data, BBR then decides how fast it wants to send its data.\nThe result of this is an algorithm that can send more data at any given time (without incurring losses), especially on long-haul links. Google says one of its benchmarks showed a 2,700x increase in throughput rate, but that’s obviously an edge case and a synthetic benchmark.\nThe company first publicly talked about BBR in a paper last year and has since open-sourced the protocol.

It’s clear that the company wants to encourage people to use the hashtag so that it becomes a pop culture symbol. Many popular Instagram accounts use this method to resurface popular posts as well, such as @ihavethisthingwithfloors.\nThis isn’t Apple’s first Instagram account — @applemusic currently has 2.2 million followers. I’ve also seen Apple ads for Apple Music and the Apple Watch on Instagram. But it’s interesting to see Apple creating an “Instagram-native” account.\n", "tags": "shot-on-iphone,iphone", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/apple-has-an-official-instagram-account-showcasing-photos-shot-on-iphone/", "id": "1524176"}, {"title": "Honeydue is a money management app for couples", "text": "Honeydue is a mobile app that aims to reduce money-related arguments between couples by offering tools to share information on respective account balances and spending.\nThe app also lets couples stay on top of money matters in other ways, such as being able to comment on individual transactions and manage bill reminders together — so they can, in the words of co-founder Eugene Park, “be on the same page” about money.\n“My co-founder, Thien Tran, and I are pretty passionate about personal finance and helping others develop better financial habits and literacy,” Park tells TechCrunch, explaining how the idea for the app came about.\n“When we started this project both [of us] were living with our partners and arguing, from time to time, with our partners about money. And it sort of hit us — with all of these basic tools that are out, there if couples like us can’t get on the same page with money then these tools really don’t matter.”\nThe target user is typically in the Millennial age-range — with Park noting there are some 32M Millennials now living with a partner. “We believe all of them should be co-managing their money together and certainly co-developing their financial literacy habits together,” he says.\nThe founders surveyed 600 couples to help spec out the app’s feature set, and the research threw up a few surprises — such as how much demand there was for a bill reminder facility. Sixty per cent of users who sign up to use the app now create at least one bill reminder during the onboarding process, according to Park.\n“We were shocked,” he says of this appetite for bill reminders. “We thought, maybe it’s because we live in this Bay Area bubble where everything’s being auto-paid, but why do people want bill reminders?\n“[W]e took a deep dive into it and I think the narrative that’s emerging is… 75 per cent of Americans generally are living paycheck to paycheck. And are having to make a very difficult decision of which bill to pay. And for that reason that’s why they’re not autopaying it.”\n“The top four banks in this country are charging $6.4BN in bank fees — whether they’re late fees or overdraft fees — and so I have to imagine, I don’t any data to prove this, that that money is coming from some of the most vulnerable parts of our culture,” he continues.\n“And so these folks, they’re very sensitive to two things: one is the actual timing of when to pay their bills. And two, their account balances so that they don’t go under certain minimums that result in monthly fees.”\nThe team also found the most used existing application for couples to manage their finances together is spreadsheets — hence spying an opportunity to build something better.\n“If financial literacy is bad in this country, spreadsheet literacy is almost as bad,” says Park. “18 per cent of couples that we surveyed are using spreadsheets. And it was 3x over any other app or service. And so we’re setting out to build a better alternative to these spreadsheets that couples are co-managing.”\n“If nothing else we’re automatically updating your balances and activity, whereas a spreadsheet can’t do that,” he adds.\nA key friction point the app aims to address is to enable users to choose how much information they share.\n“One of the hesitation points that we saw in a lot of the couples was that they didn’t necessary want to argue about the little things,” he explains. “Did you take Uber vs Lyft, The number one argument we read in a study was over frivolous purchases. So a lot of couples said that they want to goal set and plan but they don’t necessarily want to argue about did they make frivolous purchases. So one of the features we allow you to is we allow you to track your account balances but choose what you want to share.\n“So you can choose which accounts you want to share, you can choose whether you just want to share the balance only. Or whether you also want to share activity and transactions as well.”\n“We looked at… existing tools like Mint.com and others, and they are generally not collaborative in nature,” he adds. “One of the friction points for a lot of couples is choosing what they want to share with each other. Choosing how much of their finances that they want to delegate vs collaborate on.”\nThe Honeydue app soft launched on iOS in late January and Android in March. They have around 20,000 registered users at this point. The app is currently US-only.\n“We skew female, I believe it’s 60 per cent. Which makes us relatively unique relative to other personal finance apps,” he adds.\n“What’s interesting is from a generational perspective and a behavioral perspective we’re seeing that Millennials are more likely to co-manage their finances together as opposed to my parents generation, my generation (X).\n“So we did a survey of 600 couples and 75% reported that they co-manage some to all of their finances together so that is generally our target market: People that are committed to sharing financial responsibility as well as financial literacy with each other.”\nUsers are typically using the app to connect and share their bank account balances — which is what the team considers “our core use-case and our core pitch/value proposition” — although, interestingly, couples still choose not to share information on a portion of their accounts.\n“What’s interesting is that approximately 60 per cent of accounts are shared at some level but 40 per cent are not,” notes Park. “And so couples that are signing up for our app are exercising that privacy and autonomy.”\nAnother “interesting use-case” that’s emerged for the app is a feature called “what’s that charge?” — which lets users query each other about individual transactions.\n“What we were noticing is that a lot of couples, before we built this app, they were looking at their bank statements and whenever they saw a transaction that they didn’t recognize they would screenshot it in a mobile app and then they would MMS it to their partners and ask do you recognize this charge? And that loop was regular, was repeatedly regularly and we just thought that was so silly, so we made it easier for partners to identify these transactions and share them or ask their partner what’s that charge?\n“So we added a comment section under each transaction as well as an emoticon button. So you can flag transactions, you can express shock to a transaction with your partner or thumbs up support. We’re seeing a good number of couples that are using that on a regular basis, so that’s another common use-case.”\nAnother feature that’s proving popular aims to help couples who are trying to budget together — by allowing them to see their spending autonomically categorized.\nBill splitting (or “sharing” in the app’s language) is also supported, although Park says this turned out to be less popular than the founders thought it would be, with only around 5 per cent os users making use of it.\nThere’s no native payment facility within the app itself either — if couples need to settle an IOY between each other Honeydue links out to PayPal or Venmo to do the actual moving of money.\n“Once you’re getting into the business of helping people move money then we expose ourselves to another level of scrutiny,” adds Park.\nCurrently, the app supports integrating with around 9,000 of the biggest banks in the US, via its data provider — which he describes as “pretty broad coverage of the most popular banks”.\n“Like other personal finance tools we go through one of three major financial data providers. Generally the way it works is when you enter your credentials, it’s validated with the bank and they provide us with a token and we store that token and with that token we can’t do anything other than look up your balance and your transactions. and keep them up to date.“\nIn terms of business model, the app is free to use — which does of course bring up the question of how they intend to monetize the visibility they’re gaining into users’ bank accounts and spending habits.\nAnd while Park couches the privacy policy and terms of service as “pretty restrictive” — saying, “in generally we’re not allowed to sell your data to anyone, similar to Mint.com and Credit Karma” — the eventual plan is to “offer our users offers”, so they will be using income and transaction/spending data to support custom marketing of other financial services, down the line, taking a cut of any services sales as their commission.\n“Essentially we want to help guide our users to better financial products and services that we think will save them money, and we will use your data to help tailor some of these offers to you, without compromising your identity to third parties,” he says, adding: “It’s not at the top of our roadmap but in some point in order to keep it free we’ll start testing that.”\nThe Y Combinator backed startup is graduating in the accelerator’s summer 2017 cohort, and will be looking to raise seed funding shortly after demo day.", "tags": "mint-com,personal-finance", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/honeydue-is-a-money-management-app-for-couples/", "id": "1524079"}, {"title": "Seattle study puts down some common criticisms of Airbnb-style renting as regulations loom", "text": "Airbnb may have put its foot in its mouth before when it comes to communicating the benefits it brings to cities, but it’s hard to argue with raw, uncut science. A new study from the Internet Association, a trade group comprising many online properties including Airbnb, takes a hard look at housing stats in Seattle and bats away a few issues commonly brought up regarding the service.\nOne criticism that appears repeatedly, especially in fast-growing cities where gentrification and developers are roundly resented, is that people are buying up housing units just to rent them on Airbnb. It’s simpler and more profitable than long-term rental, and there’s less paperwork — but of course, it could limit housing options for people that, you know, actually live somewhere.\nWhile Airbnb maintains that only a small number of units being rented in Seattle are of this type, multi-unit hosts are the fastest growing category for the area, according to a study of data from 2015 and 2016.\nThe city conducted its own review of Airbnb data and found that a quarter of the full homes available for rent on the service are not the host’s primary residence. And Inside Airbnb, which tracks rental data in various cities, suggests the numbers may be even higher than that.\nWhen asked for comment, Airbnb didn’t dispute the preceding numbers exactly, but cautioned that the data and methods vary widely, so any analysis (including its own, really) should be examined in context. For example, Inside Airbnb calls any home available for more than 60 days “high availability,” though that’s within the normal range by the company’s reckoning.\nThe IA study tackled the multi-unit host criticism by looking for correlations between short-term rentals (STRs) and owner occupancy of housing. The logic is that if Airbnb and other services promote this type of behavior — multiple homes or units being used exclusively as STRs — you’d expect to see a relationship there. The researchers also looked at investment mortgages, the kind of loans you’d take on if you were looking to make a business out of a few cheap homes in your area.\nThat doesn’t seem to be the case, according to the stats the IA parsed. Chart time:\n“Our findings suggest that STRs help Seattleites stay in their homes,” the IA’s Chief Economist and author of the paper, Christopher Hooton, told TechCrunch. “Investment mortgages do not spike because of short-term rental activity. In fact, they are negatively correlated. Nor does owner occupancy decrease or rents increase.”\nSo while there will likely always be a few examples of this kind of digital property portfolio, it seems that there just isn’t enough of it to have a major effect on rent and housing availability. Other factors in a growing city like Seattle, such as the gazillion ugly, expensive new apartment buildings they’re putting in all over the place, are likely a much greater influence.\n(I’m going to be priced out of my place soon in no small part because it’s spitting distance from Amazon HQ. People are happy to pay extortionate rents when they only intend to stay in the city for two years.)\nIn any case, proposed rules from the city (currently inching their way through the usual red tape) would limit hosts to renting out a total of two units. That would act as an effective damper on multi-unit operations, and if Airbnb’s own spin on this topic (this report included) is taken at face value, the company shouldn’t really care, since it claims very few users are in that commercial class.\n“The vast majority of our hosts in Seattle are sharing the home in which they live to earn a little extra money,” the company said in a statement. “Hosts with multiple entire home listings make up a small fraction of our community. We’re committed to being good partners with the City of Seattle and are working with city leaders to craft short-term rental regulations that will protect long-term housing stock and allow Seattle families to share their homes.”\nThe other issue looked at by the IA study is the idea that STRs are interfering with the hotel business. It’s kind of hard to sympathize with the incumbent industry here, but at the same time we want to avoid a situation like Uber’s in which a challenger is mainly competitive because it is cutting corners at every possible opportunity to undercut its opponents. So it’s good to put eyes on potential problem areas like this.\nThe study shows that there’s actually very little geographical overlap between hotels and home rentals, and this tallies with common sense: are you really going to try to compete with the Marriott on its home turf? No, you rent your neat spot in “scenic” West Seattle for much less and because there are so few hotel options there.\nYou can see that in this rather strangely colored-in map:\nThe Seattle rules would also require hosts to get a business license and a city-issued Short Term Rental Operator’s License; proof would also have to be provided that the units to be rented are the host’s primary or secondary residence, that they are up to code, and that basic safety information is available to renters.\nAirbnb calls these “unnecessary, complicated barriers to entry,” but they sound like good ideas to me. It’s not like you have to report to the city every time you rent to someone — you just need to get on the radar and show you’re meeting some basic standards. The license and income information would also reduce the government’s total reliance on rental platforms for that data. Plus, you know, taxes.\nLike so many new business models, home-sharing presents powerful opportunities to users and unique challenges to businesses and regulators. Different cities require different handling of such things, and New York’s law may differ from Seattle’s greatly but be no less tailored to its own needs. The next couple years will make for something of a global experiment as various methods of regulating short-term rentals (to say nothing of ride-sharing and other “sharing economy” options) and the results should be fascinating — though perhaps more so for users and regulators than the companies affected.", "tags": "sharing-economy,home-sharing", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/06/seattle-study-puts-down-some-common-criticisms-of-airbnb-style-renting-as-regulations-loom/", "id": "1523735"}, {"title": "Google said to launch AMP-based Snapchat Discover-like feature", "text": "Google is creating a visual publication format for media companies similar to Snapchat’s “Discover,” based on its AMP mobile optimization technology for webpages and called “Stamp,” according to a new Wall Street Journal report.\nThe program is said to be announced as soon as next week, and could include a range of publishing partners including Vox, CNN, The Washington Post and more.

Now, for some users, the ability to “go live” – meaning start a live video broadcast – is appearing right within the Facebook Camera screen, alongside other options, like the ability to use Facebook Live Audio, or create a GIF.\nLive streaming on Facebook was a feature first introduced back in 2015, initially only for public figures and celebrities. It later rolled out to regular Facebook users via the company’s iOS and Android applications, and, at the beginning of this year, to the desktop.\nWith the growing popularity of podcasts, Facebook later also added a Live Audio feature, designed largely for publishers and authors, who use it for things like news radio-like shows, book readings, and other audio-only broadcasts.\nBut you can’t “go live” from the Facebook Camera today, which actually seems a little odd.\nIt makes sense to combine all camera-related functions on just one screen, as this test is doing. That includes taking a personal photo or video to share on Facebook, using photo filters, making a GIF (another option still in testing), or recording live audio and live video.\nFor those who are seeing the new version of Facebook Camera, the different functions are appearing across the top of the screen under tabs that read “Live,” “Normal,” and “GIF.”\nWhen you’re on the “Live” tab, you can tap on an icon of a video camera to live stream video, or tap on a microphone icon to just stream audio.\n\nWhat’s more, the new feature also offers you the option to go live just in your Facebook Story, as opposed to sharing your live video in a regular Facebook post.

While the benefits won’t kick in in time for Snap’s pivotal Q2 earnings call next week, Advanced Mode could help the upstart put a dent in the Google/Facebook ad duopoly down the line.\n\nSnap launched its self-serve Ads Manager in May, and added vertical video creation tool Snap Publisher in July.

The search giant held informal talks with Snap and floated an offer of $30 billion in 2016 before Snap’s last funding round, and just before its IPO this year, according to Business Insider’s Alex Heath. That offer was apparently an open secret inside Snap, and was on the table after the IPO, too.\nBut Snap’s notoriously independent CEO Evan Spiegel has apparently showed no interest in selling out to Google or anyone else. That’s despite the startup’s market cap slipping to around $15 billion after soaring as high as $30 billion when it IPO’d in May.\nNews of Google’s interest helped Snap’s share price climb around 2.3 percent today. The uptick comes after weeks of decline due to lockup expiration finally allowing insiders to sell stock, and strong growth for Facebook’s Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status clones of Snapchat.\nGoogle declined to comment to Business Insider and Snap told TechCrunch “these rumors are false.” It’s possible that Google’s interest was very preliminary, and likely never rose to Snap’s higher ranks.

Read more in our feature piece: “Google and Facebook envision Stories for news, not social“]\nGoogle’s growth-stage investment fund CapitalG ended up investing in Snap after the 2016 talks went nowhere, contributing to the round valuing the “camera company” at $20 billion. The organizations have long been buddy-buddy. Google chairman Eric Schmidt was an adviser to Spiegel, Snap runs Google’s office software suite and Snapchat has committed to spending $2 billion on Google Cloud hosting over the next five years.\nAt the time of the May 2016 choice to go with raising money instead of being acquired, Snap looked unchallenged in the full-screen Stories social media game. But in August, Instagram’s soon to be wildly successful Stories clone launched, which has diverted growth, mind share and advertisers from Snap ever since.\n\nJoining forces could be beneficial to both companies. Google would get a top social property to make up for its Google+, Buzz and Wave flops. It could also reap data about people’s social graphs, where they spend time and what topics they care about, allowing it to improve its ad targeting and measurement.\nSnap would gain a deep-pocketed parent that could provide extra capital to make acquisitions and build out its R&D-heavy augmented reality technology. Machine vision and image recognition algorithms from Google Search could unlock information about what’s in everyone’s Snaps. Google’s advertising expertise and connections could boost Snap’s ad revenue.\nTogether, they could align their Google Glass and Snap Spectacles hardware efforts to build a powerful but appealing AR device. However, Google’s open, engineering-driven culture could clash with Snap’s secretive, design-driven culture.\n\nBut Spiegel is the real stumbling block. He and his co-founder Bobby Murphy have configured Snap’s voting rights to give them full control over the direction of the company, denying public backers any say. So even if investors would love to take the $30 billion offer that’s double Snap’s current market cap, they couldn’t compel it to do so. Spiegel famously rebuked Mark Zuckerberg’s offers to buy Snapchat, and is known for following his gut over outside advice.\nAs we wrote before the IPO, to bet on Snap is to bet on Spiegel — for better or worse.

A small question mark icon appears in the Stories module, as well, which will explain the feature’s purpose, when hovered over with your cursor.\nThe explanation simply states that Stories consist of photos and video that are visible for 24 hours before they disappear.\nFacebook has confirmed to TechCrunch the Stories launch on desktop is still considered a test, but notes that a wider rollout is expected soon.\nThe company chose to bring Stories to Facebook, after seeing its success on Instagram, where Stories had debuted in summer 2016.\n\nWith the first five months, Instagram Stories soared to 150 million daily users. It now has 250 million daily users, compared with Snapchat’s 166 million. Half of the businesses on Instagram created a story in the past month, Facebook also announced this week, and Instagram’s average usage has climbed to 32 minutes per day for those under 25, and 24 minutes per day for those 25 and up, it said.\nThe feature arrived on Facebook at the beginning of 2017, initially in Ireland before expanding to other countries, including the U.S.\nThe company has credited Snapchat with pioneering the visual communication format, but believes the pivot into Stories goes beyond simply copying a competitor’s popular app. Like Facebook’s News Feed – a format that went on to become the standard across social apps – Stories are a new way to share. That’s led to the format being broadly adopted across the industry.\nFacebook itself has added Stories to Instagram, Messenger, and its flagship app. It even tried a Stories-like feature in WhatsApp. Elsewhere, Stories is inspiring redesigns of other top apps, including most recently, Tinder, Match, and Skype.\nHowever, on Facebook, the feature hasn’t seen as much traction.\nIn fact, there were so few people using Stories on Facebook’s mobile app, that the company in April began to display grayed-out icons of your most frequently contacted friends instead of blank spaces in the Stories feature that no one much was using.\nIt’s unclear that bringing Facebook Stories to the desktop web will impact its usage significantly. Perhaps, after all, there are only so many places users want to post this sort of ephemeral content, and for the time being, people have chosen Instagram.

But co-founders Shahzad Younas and Ryan Brodie are clear about what sets their target audience apart from the casual dating/hook-up crowd: a genuine intent to find a partner in order to get married.\nWhich is why, they say, they’re definitely not just cloning Tinder for Muslims.\n“Our audience is super captivated, they’re so invested in this search,” says Brodie. “For a Muslim in their twenties, their upbringing has been so centered to find a husband or wife. And that is for most Muslims. I think some people think it’s just like JCrush for Jews. But it’s totally not about that from where we stand.\n“Not just market size — we’re more than 100 times larger market than the Jewish market, for example — but the real difference is the seriousness and intent. It’s not casual dating. In Islam there’s a concept where… you’re only ever going to be half way there without your spouse. So this is how central it is. This is where almost all our users come at it from.”\nSome two years after the launch of the first version of the app, Muzmatch has around 200,000 users, spread across ~160 countries, and is growing around 10 per cent, month on month, according to the co-founders.\n“We’ve had weddings across the world,” says Younas. “Right now about 30 people a day are leaving our app and telling us specifically I found my partner on your app or I just got engaged or we just got married.”\n\nGrowth thus far has coming organically, via word-of-mouth recommendations in the Muslim community, they say. Around half of Muzmatch users are in the UK; around a third are in the US and Canada; with the rest spread all over the world. Gender wise, roughly two-thirds of are male, and one-third is female. The average age is mid to late twenties.\nThe founders say the matchmaking app has led to around 6,000 couples getting together so far — and “at least 600 confirmed weddings” — although they can’t be sure the number isn’t higher as not everyone messages them with their stories.\nThey tell a funny story about how they were emailed by a man from Uganda thanking them for helping him meet his wife via the app — and when they went to check exactly how many users they had in Uganda it was, well, just those two. “When it’s meant to be, it is meant to be!” says Younas.\nDespite a few ‘rest of world’ successes to point to, their current “concentrated focus” is on Muslims in the West — tackling what they describe as the “key problem” for this 60-million community: “low density of Muslims”. Which means that Muslim singles searching for a partner of the same faith in towns and cities in places like the UK, US and Canada are likely to face a shortage of potential mates. At least in their immediate vicinity.\nThese dynamics work in Muzmatch’s favor, reckons Brodie, because their target market is already geared up to putting in extra work to find ‘the one’. And is also therefore likely to appreciate a tech tool that helps make their search easier.\n“What’s great for us is there’s already an expectation of movement, so we’ve never had to worry about the network effect. Most dating apps, every user expects to meet the one a mile down the road — luckily for us, that expectation isn’t there, which is brilliant,” he tells TechCrunch.\nAnother advantage of addressing such an engaged user base, according to the founders, is Muzmatch’s singles are incentivized to fill out their profiles with lots of detailed information — given how many criteria can be at play as part of their search (i.e. over and above just whether they find a potential partner attractive, and relating to other factors such as family, culture, tradition, religious level and so on) — and the app can then utilize all this rich user data for improving its suggested matches.\n“With our app, and with the technology in the app, we’re really trying to cater to those specific needs,” says Younas, describing the difficulties Muslims in the West can have meeting a person who meets all their criteria. “We think that conventional Western dating apps don’t really cater to this.”\nThe business is already profitable, taking revenue including via premium subscriptions and in-app purchases which offer users additional features, such as the ability to be matched with someone before they’ve liked you (as a way to try to get their attention) — though it’s free to join and use the basic app.\n“Because there’s a more serious intent, people are more willing to spend vs… a casual dating app — where the expectation is almost free,” argues Younas.\nAnd while Muzmatch’s feature-set has some basic mechanisms that would be familiar to any Tinder user, like the ability to ‘like’ or ‘pass’ on a possible match, and the ability to chat in-app with mutual matches, it also has differences that reflect the needs of its community — which Younas describes as being “essentially” without a casual dating market, as a result of marriage being “such a big part of our faith”.\nSo, for example, all users have to take a selfie via the app so their profile can be manually verified to help boost trust and keep out spammers; users don’t have to provide their real name though, and can choose not to display photos on their profiles or blur photos unless there’s an active match.\nUsers are also asked to rate others they have interacted with — and these ratings are fed into the matching algorithm, with the aim of surfacing “quality users” and promoting positive behaviors that mesh well with a community of singles that’s typically really serious about finding a life partner.\nFemale users can also opt for a chaperoning feature whereby all of their in-app chats are emailed to a wali/guardian, should they wish to observe this type of Islamic etiquette.\nThere are a few other differences in how males and females experience the app, such as women having more granular controls over who can see their photos, and being able to view more profiles per day before being capped (this is on account of there currently being more male users, say the founders).\n“It’s transparent to both sides,” says Younas of the wali/guardian option. “So both parties in that conversation know that there’s a third party involved. And for us these are optional features we give to our users — depending on where they’re at, we don’t necessarily want to push a religious angle on people, but what we want to do is give them the option. So if you’re very religiously inclined you can pick these options.”\n“For us being accessible to everyone is really the key to owning this market,” he adds. “There’s 1.8 billion Muslims across the world, and they’re very diverse — in culture, in language, in their outlooks, in particular religious etiquette, so what we’re trying to do is navigate all of that in a very — I wouldn’t necessarily say neutral way — but in a very accessible way to everybody… And so far it’s been working.”\nThe founders say they are intentionally making an effort to discourage the transactional dynamic that can creep into dating apps like Tinder — so, for instance, there are limits on the number of profiles a user can swipe through in a 12 hour period (although users can also pay to remove the cap); and people can also go back and revisit profiles they previously passed on, or rematch with people they previously unmatched if they change their mind later.\n“We’ve actually had many examples of now married couples that have actually gone back and changed their minds,” says Brodie. “Unlike say on Tinder you can actually rematch someone. So you can unmatch if it didn’t work out and then in case six months later, something’s changed… you can rematch them.”\n“We had a girl message us saying thank god for the rematch feature — because I wouldn’t have got with this guy if you didn’t have it,” adds Younas. “So we know this stuff works.”\nYounas boostrapped and built the initial app himself, having — as a young Muslim in London — been unimpressed with the quality of existing Muslim dating websites, which he describes as “ugly and horrible”, and having a “terrible reputation”.\nBrodie came on board later, after meeting Younas and being excited by the early traction for the MVP — and the pair relaunched Muzmatch last August.\nWith growing ambitions, they say they started to feel London was not the ideal base to try to scale a consumer app. Hence they applied and got onto Y Combinator’s program — and will be graduating in the 2017 summer batch of YC startups.\n“Our ambitions have grown and grown and grown,” says Brodie. “We realized the opportunity we have here and we thought, in London at least, we weren’t going to get the ammo that we needed or the thoughts and the beliefs that you have in the West Coast of America… [YC] has got an incredible track record so we just thought let’s do this.”\nWhile they’ve started with Muslims living in the West, their ambitions scale to the global Muslim market as a whole — seeing big potential to grow beyond their first focus on markets with a low density of Muslims.\nIndeed, Brodie argues there’s even more need for a matchmaking app in majority Muslim countries which he says already have big but — as he sees it — ineffective and often expensive matchmaking industries. So, in other words, a high density of potential mates is still a problem for a matchmatching app to fix.\n“There’s already a huge market of matchmakers [in countries like Indonesia]. But it’s incredibly ineffective,” he argues. “It’s not just a problem in the West, where there’s low density, even in a country where everyone’s a Muslim, as is the case for everyone, finding partners is very difficult.”\nIn terms of competition, and setting aside the older generation of matchmaking websites, Brodie says there are a “few” others trying to build dating apps for Muslim singles — a quick search on the App Store brings up Minder and Salaam-Swipe as just two examples — but claims Muzmatch is at least twice as big as “our nearest app competitor”.\n“Our competitors are going about this completely the wrong way,” he argues. “They are essentially repackaging Tinder for Muslims which we know just doesn’t work and is why our competition has really bad credibility in the community.”\n“The key for us is we’ve tried to go about this with an understanding of the Muslim culture and the particular quirks and sensibilities in terms of how they find a partner,” adds Younas.\n“And this is why, for a lot of Muslims, Western dating apps don’t work because it doesn’t really cater to that particular need and intent. So, for us, from the beginning we’ve really thought about that, and ingrained that into our design and into our product. And we think, long term, that will set us apart.”\nThe founders also reckon Muzmatch might stand a better chance than typical dating apps of monetizing beyond the business of matching and dating itself — by offering related services, such as, for example, helping users find a wedding venue. Which may be important if their users are pairing up and getting married relatively quickly.\n“I think we have a better chance than most to achieve monetization post-match. Because just the [short] timespan [between Muslims finding a partner and getting married] and the relationship with us is so close to the events unfolding I think, longer term, this might be an interesting space for us,” says Brodie.\n“Right now the Muslim market is huge, so we’re not going to run out of customers,” adds Younas.\nAs they head into YC demo day, the pair are looking to raise funding but Younas says they intend to “tread carefully”, given Muzmatch is already profitable — the aim is to raise to “really accelerate things but on a more sustainable level”, he says.\nThey want to invest in areas such as localization and growing the size of the team (from currently just the two of them), so any funding will be going towards preparing for future growth, such as by investing in headcount and backend infrastructure.\n“We have global ambitions,” says Younas. “We’re not just looking at the US, Canada and the UK. We really want to be the global player for Muslims worldwide looking for a partner.”\n“Without a doubt, in ten years’ time, someone will have achieved this. We want to achieve this — and part of this raise will be making sure we have the ammo to really go for it,” adds Brodie. “We’re not just a niche dating app. This is totally different.\n“This is a unique product, for 1.8 billion people… Half of the world’s population of Muslims are under thirty. In countries like Saudi Arabia, two-thirds of their population are under thirty. The growth in Muslim population across the world is phenomenal.”", "tags": "social-software,dating", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/yc-backed-muzmatch-definitely-doesnt-want-to-be-tinder-for-muslims/", "id": "1523001"}, {"title": "YouTube starts delivering ‘breaking news’ on its homepage across platforms", "text": "YouTube has started rolling out a “Breaking News” section in people’s feeds today across platforms as Alphabet continues to tailor custom content playlists to users logged into Google Accounts, Android Police reports.\nFor most, YouTube is a place to hop from one video to the next and descend down rabbit holes, but browsing anything like a feed has become less straightforward than other platforms, which makes the breaking news section an interesting addition.\n\nAs the video sharing site has grown older, the content has grown more produced with YouTube personalities mounting “celebrity” careers, while commentary-heavy videos grow in popularity over the raw video that is more common on Facebook and Twitter.\nFor YouTube’s part this has grown to be a very valuable distinction.

Facebook explained why it won’t let them in a post in its Hard Questions series today about social networking after death.\nFacebook admits it doesn’t have all the answers, but it has come up with some decent solutions to some issues with what it calls Memorialized Profiles and a “Legacy Contact.” When you pass away, once Facebook is informed, the word “Remembering” appears above your name on your profile and no one else can sign in to your account.\n\nThe Legacy Contact is a friend you select in your Manage Account Settings while you’re still alive, though they’re not informed until your profile is memorialized. They can pin a post atop your profile, change your profile pic, respond to friend requests or have your account removed. But Facebook explains they can’t log into your account, change or delete old posts, remove friends or read your messages.\nSimilarly, Facebook won’t allow parents or anyone else to read your messages after you die. That’s because “In a private conversation between two people, we assume that both people intended the messages to remain private,” writes Monika Bickert, Facebook’s Director of Global Policy Management. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and Stored Communications Act may also prohibit it from sharing private communications even with parental consent.\nFacebook also tries to minimize the emotional impact of losing a loved one by no longer sending birthday reminders about writing on their wall. But there are still plenty of opportunities for hurt feelings. Facebook’s On This Day feature and others can surface old content from when that person was still alive, creating an unexpected experience of having to think about their death.\n\nThe company has built features to enhance empathy with its users, allowing them to avoid unnecessarily seeing their exes on the app after a break-up. But it’s tough to know what will be a sweet nostalgic reminder and what will be a heart-wrenching spiral into the past.\nWhat’s important is that Facebook is at least thinking and talking about these issues. Now at 2 billion users, Facebook has become a ubiquitous utility that impacts every phase of our lives. “There’s a deep sense of responsibility in every part of the company,” says Facebook CPO Chris Cox. “We’re getting to the scale where we have to get much better about understanding how the product has been used.”", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/facebook-after-death/", "id": "1528526"}, {"title": "Google to livestream Android O launch event timed for total solar eclipse", "text": "Google is using a astronomical event to debut its newest Android operating system update: Android O is set to arrive on August 21, with a livestreamed unveiling event timed for 2:40 PM ET in NYC – which is roughly when the maximum solar eclipse is set to occur for New York.\nAndroid O will get a full reveal at that time, which seems like kind of a weird time to do it since a lot of people will be watching the NASA eclipse livestream that Google is also promoting, or staring at the sky (with the caveat, hopefully, that they have procured proper glasses for safe viewing).\nGoogle says that Android O will have some “super (sweet) new powers,” most of which we know all about thanks to pre-release builds and the Android O teaser Google provided at its annual I/O developer event this past May.

I did, repeatedly, and wrote a story in 2014 titled “Yo Facebook, Ban Links With Fake Video Play Buttons”.\nNow Facebook is doing just that. Today it started downranking the News Feed presence of links that display a fake play button in the preview image, as well as videos that are actually just a static image uploaded as a video file. Publishers who use these scammy tactics will see a major decrease in the distribution of these stories. Facebook won’t completely delete these posts, though, unless they violate its other policies.\nHere are two examples of fake play buttons that spammers used to steal your clicks:\n\nFacebook has prohibited the use of fake play buttons in advertisements under its policy against depicting non-existent functionality for a few years, News Feed Product Manager Greg Marra tells me. But the scourage has remained in the News Feed.\n“We’ve heard from people who are frustrated by fake play buttons” Marra says, hence today’s update. “Spammers are using these tactics to trick people into clicking links to low quality web pages.Facebook tells me its now training its machine vision artificial intelligence to classify and detect fake play buttons in preview images.\n“While the prevalence is statistically low, the frustration expressed by people who use Facebook who encounter these deceptive practices is high” a spokesperson tells me.\nFacebook says that if publishers want to denote there’s a video behind a link, they should indicate that through Open Graph meta tags. They could also use words like “Watch” or “Video” in the headline or description.\n \nFacebook has had a similar problem with publishers looping pre-recorded videos and calling them live, or just putting up a computer graphic countdown and calling it Live. TechCrunch called on Facebook to ban these shenanigans back in January, and it cracked down on them in May.\nThere’s also been the issue of publishers putting fake Instant Articles “Lightning Bolt” icons on the preview images of links to non-Instant Articles on the standard web. That’s because people are more likely to click Instant Articles since they load faster.\nMeanwhile, Facebook’s emphasis on video in News Feed has inspired the new menace of publishers uploading a static image as a video to get more eyeballs. These static image videos will be downranked too. Facebook is using a “motion scoring” system that detects movement inside a video to classify and demote these clips.\n\nToday’s changes come as part of a massive, multi-pronged atack on clickbait. Facebook now downranks headlines that are misleading or withhold information in many languages, shows fewer links overshared by spammers, works with outside fact checkers to demote false news, promotes iand now shows Related Articles with different angles to make people suspicious of exaggerated clickbait.\nWith each of these updates, Facebook chips away at the clickbait problem, leaving more room in the News Feed for legitimate content. Getting burned by trying to watch a video which is just endless minutes of the same image erodes trust in the News Feed, making people less likely to watch videos in the future.\nBy excising these annoying experiences, users may be willing to browse longer, view more videos from friends and publishers, and watch lucrative video ads that fund Facebook’s soaring profits.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/facebook-fake-play-buttons/", "id": "1528083"}, {"title": "Essential Phone now available to order, ships soon to pre-sale customers", "text": "The Essential Phone has arrived, a bit later than originally announced.

Should we bring inflatable habitats? Should we ship girders and metal sheets? Or should we, as explored in a recent NASA challenge, 3D-print the structures right there on the planet in question? Two universities’ early efforts to do so earned them a combined $400,000 at a competition held last week.\nIt’s not the first nor last of these challenges, but the culmination of phase two of the three-phase 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge. The idea is to figure out what materials, designs and other choices might factor into creating a strong, simple structure.\nBeams, cylinders and domes were what the teams had to create, with materials that were at least 70 percent “indigenous material” — so something that could be found locally. After all, you don’t want to have to ship a bunch of concrete mix to Phobos.\nThe winning teams both chose “powdery Crushed Basaltic Igneous” as their indigenous base; the team from Branch Technology augmented this with recycled plastic, while Penn State attempted (with partial success) to create a cement-like material that incorporated water.\n\nBesides the materials chosen and basic dimensions of the items required, the teams were relatively unfettered. “The rules were formulated so that the teams could have freedom to formulate a solution with as much flexibility as possible,” explained a NASA representative who was part of the event. “Both solutions have their own advantages and disadvantages, and these diverse solutions can help NASA formulate that best solution.”\nGiant 3D printers were used to create the items in question, after which they were graded on various measures and then crushed — sorry, “compressed to failure.” The Branch team’s dome handled an impressive 1,694 kilograms, or 373 lbs. Penn State’s collapsed under just below half of that — but the NASA rep pointed out that the cement-like mixture would have been far stronger had it been able to cure for another week or so.\nThis is both a strength and a weakness, exactly the kind of data NASA hoped to glean from the competition. As in the Cube Quest Challenge, the agency proudly advertises that it relies on the fertile imaginations of students and outsiders to augment its own expertise.\nThe Branch team took home $250,000 for its efforts, and Penn State was awarded $150,000.

For example, you’ll be able to tell Alexa to play your music in the living room, play music upstairs or downstairs, or even just play your music everywhere.\nBeyond just saying “play my music,” followed by a location, you can also ask Alexa to play your favorite artist, or use other music-related commands, as you would normally.\nThe feature, at launch, works across some – but not all – of the music services supported by Echo. Naturally, it supports Amazon’s own music service (which also just slashed its student pricing today), as well as TuneIn, iHeartRadio and Pandora. The company says that support for Spotify and Sirius XM is coming soon, but didn’t provide an exact timeframe.\nEcho devices, Echo Dot and Echo Show smart speaker systems will support multi-room music in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, starting today.\nThe ability to synchronize your music across your home could make Echo devices a poor-man’s alternative to pricier home audio and speaker systems. While Amazon’s speakers aren’t necessarily known today for having the best sound quality – it’s Alexa that’s really selling them – rumor has it that Amazon is working on a high-end speaker to compete with Apple’s forthcoming HomePod.\nAdding multi-room music support ahead of an updated, better quality Echo device makes sense as gives time for Amazon to get its software working, as well as put tools into the hands of other device makers that will allow their own speaker systems to work with Alexa in this way, too. That could potentially impact demand for Apple’s device.\nOn this front, Amazon also today introduced the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) multi-room music SDK, which will allow device makers to integrate with the new music feature. Once enabled on devices, consumers can stream their music across Echo and other AVS devices at the same time. For instance, you could play your music on a couple of Echos and a set of standalone speakers at the same time.\nThe SDK is becoming available early next year, but a sign-up form is available now.\nRelated to this, new connected speaker APIs are also rolling out that will allow device makers of connected audio systems to control their music playback using Alexa. This one is particularly clever because it makes Echo a companion device and not a competitor to other popular audio systems.\nAmazon says it’s already working with Sonos, Bose, Sound United, and Samsung to integrate this technology into their devices. That means you could use an Echo – perhaps an Echo Dot, which is too small and underpowered to deliver great audio – to ask Alexa to play your music on your Sonos system instead.\n“Alexa set the standard for voice in smart homes, so working with Amazon to bring voice control to Sonos for the first time was an obvious choice,” said Antoine Leblond, VP of Software at Sonos, in a statement.\n“This has been a close collaboration from the beginning as we’ve worked together to combine the magic of Alexa with the seamless multi-room audio capabilities that Sonos pioneered. We’re proud of the work we’ve done together as Amazon’s first multi-room partner – all you’ll need is an Alexa-enabled device and playing music out loud on Sonos will be as easy as saying ‘Alexa, play music in the living room,'” Leblond added.\nSonos, it was also revealed this week by way of an FCC filing, is getting into the voice-controlled speaker game itself, with plans to sell a speaker that would have voice control, far-field microphones and supports “multiple voice platforms,” the filing said.

Taken together, it’s basically a lock that Sonos will reveal its own voice-enabled hardware on October 4.\n\nThat will mean Sonos will have its product announced (and potentially available) ahead of the actual ship date for Apple’s own HomePod speaker, which Apple unveiled in June but will be shipping only in late Q4 this year.\nSonos’ speaker will reportedly feature support between multiple voice assistants, according to the FCC filing, which would make it by far the most flexible of the current range. Offering access to a user’s platform of choice could be a game-changing feature for a smart speaker, especially when paired with the sound, build and multi-room streaming quality Sonos is already known for.\nOne more clear clue: The Verge received a separate invite, which, when paired with ours, reveals a clearer look at that interface graphic, which was shows a microphone icon atop that new controller graphic.\n", "tags": "sonos", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/sonos-sends-out-invites-for-smart-speaker-reveal-on-october-4/", "id": "1532863"}, {"title": "Uber shows off its autonomous driving program’s snazzy visualization tools", "text": "Uber’s engineering blog has just posted an interesting piece on the company’s web-based tool for exploring and visualizing data from self-driving car research. It’s a smart look at an impressive platform, and definitely has nothing to do with a long piece published last week lauding a similar platform in use by one of Uber’s most serious rivals, Waymo.\nOkay, maybe it has a little to do with that. The piece, over at The Atlantic, is quite interesting, but seemed rather to suggest that Waymo is unique in its approach to improving its autonomous cars’ AI. In fact, it’s likely that every company working on this stuff has a pretty similar approach, at least if they’re keeping pace with the state of the art.\nThe cool secret technique that in fact all the companies in question know about is the possibility of using and learning from data that’s been hoarded over a million miles of test driving. Once you’ve driven that far, you have so much data that you can mix and match it in a virtual environment and let the AI navigate it just as if it were real. The computer doesn’t know the difference! Meanwhile you can tweak the data, watch for unusual events or compare multiple models.\nThe Uber post just focuses on visualization of this data, and with details on its tools, which are wisely web-based, leading to easy collaboration and quick turnaround on new features. These days web apps can access the GPUs, communicate in real time and so on — no need for a local client any more for many things. It makes for cool GIFs.\nWhat the post doesn’t really get into, but is pretty much a foregone conclusion given the sophistication of the tools they’re showing off, is how to further multiply the data’s value by essentially making up the environment out of whole cloth.\nTake for example the problem of dealing with a major event like a parade or protest. Would you let your naive self-driving car run free during a marathon just so it has a chance to learn how the runners act? Of course not.\nWhat you can do is open up your excellent map of Boston, shut down several main thoroughfares, add lots and lots of pedestrians and erratic drivers to the virtual world and then set your AI driver agents to work getting around. You’ll see when it breaks down, how it reacts to situations it’s never seen in real life and so on. It’s like a thought experiment that generates usable data and improves the AI.\nSo maybe the timing is just a coincidence, but it seems like this post, while cool on its own, is Uber’s way of saying “Hey, we’re doing this too. Look!” Because at this point, if you’re an autonomous car developer and you’re not using simulations with all kinds of variations, you’re going to have a bad time.", "tags": "autonomous-vehicles,self-driving-cars", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/uber-shows-off-its-autonomous-driving-programs-snazzy-visualization-tools/", "id": "1532704"}, {"title": "Internet providers could easily snoop on your smart home", "text": "We’ve mostly moved past the point where our Internet of Things devices leak private information to anyone watching via unsecured connections, but that doesn’t mean you can stop being afraid. Never, ever stop being afraid. To top up your paranoia reserves, a new study finds that internet providers can, if they so choose, monitor all kinds of things from your smart home’s traitorous metadata.\nThe paper, from a team at Princeton’s computer science school led by grad student Noah Apthorpe, gets straight to the point: “we demonstrate that an ISP or other network observer can infer privacy sensitive in-home activities by analyzing internet traffic from smart homes containing commercially available IoT devices even when the devices use encryption.”\nIt’s a pretty straightforward attack: the IoT devices often identify themselves voluntarily, usually by connecting to specific domains or URLs. Even if they didn’t, there are simple ways of profiling them based on observation and some known data. The researchers demonstrated this by showing that various devices show distinct patterns of data transmission:\nOnce they’re identified, the ISP (in this case played by the researchers) can simply watch for increases in traffic. What those changes in traffic mean are either self-evident or perfectly able to be inferred with a little analysis.\nBy watching a sleep tracker, the ISP can see when the user gets in bed and wakes up, perhaps even how well they sleep, whether they get up in the middle of the night and so on.\nBy watching various smart switches, the ISP can see when certain devices are in use: the TV, the space heater, the light in the basement, the garage door.\nBy watching the IP security camera traffic, the ISP can see when the camera detects motion, when the user is tuned in to watch their home from afar or when they check archived footage.\nAnd if a handful of academics can do it, you better believe a major ISP could — though of course they’ll tell you they won’t. Doesn’t matter, they can collect this stuff and sell it without telling you, since Congress zapped the FCC’s privacy protections. The researchers note this in the paper, in fact.\nBut don’t worry, there’s actually a pretty good solution! The team found that by transmitting the IoT data through a central hub (e.g. a router with a little custom software), they could effectively camouflage it by transmitting a trickle of junk data at all times. This traffic shaping, as it’s called, doesn’t prevent the devices from working (many of them worked surprisingly well with artificially slowed connections), but it does make it hard for an attacker to tell signal from noise.\nThey suggest a constant stream of around 40 KB/s should be more than enough, though that adds up over time to over a hundred gigabytes — not something everyone can afford, depending on data caps. But that system could easily be improved or made more amenable to people with limited bandwidth.\nThe full paper is quite readable and is available here.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/study-tracks-what-smart-home-activity-can-be-seen-by-internet-providers/", "id": "1532634"}, {"title": "DJI launches bug bounty program for its software and drones", "text": "DJI wants security researchers to turn their attention to its software and drones and will pay for discovered bugs or exploits.

The new Insta360 One offers 4K video resolution, and 24 MP stills, as well as the ability to work in a completely standalone mode, remotely with your phone as a Bluetooth controller, and plugged in directly to your iPhone using your smartphone’s display as the viewfinder.\nThis latest Insta360 camera comes with a number of improvements beyond image quality, however, including a new ability to select an angle and export a 1080p non-surround video clip from whatever perspective you choose, and upping its image stabilization capabilities to allow for much smoother video, even when handheld, and to create a ‘bullet time’ video effect in slow motion using a unique capture method – circling the camera overhead quickly using either a selfie stick or a piece of string to create a super cool slow motion 360 video.\nSaid string is included attached to a standard tripod threaded mount that screws into the bottom camera, letting you get started with this cool feature right away. The string is also edited out of the image automatically, as are any selfie sticks you use with the camera, which makes for a much cleaner resulting image or video.\nThe bullet time effect is very cool, but it’s important to follow the instructions to get it right. The resulting images really do look like something pulled from The Matrix, with you as the shooter in the center and the work around you nearly frozen in time as the image zooms around. It’s a new twist on the selfie, but it also requires a lot of available space to work well – don’t expect to be doing this much indoors, or with a lot of other people in your immediate area.\nIt’s a very neat feature, but that’s probably going to be more broadly useful about the Insta360 One over time is its general flexibility. The camera has a built in tripod mount on its main body, and comes with a protective case that doubles as a stand. Its remote capabilities mean you no longer have to be that close to it to use it, and it can still plug directly in your iPhone when you want to see exactly what you’re capturing, too.\n\nThere’s an Android version coming soon, too, so don’t feel left out if that’s your platform of choice. And if you’re looking for shooting options, there are a number of different ones including RAW support for images and Log format for video, which means you can do a lot when editing the resulting files. The camera also supports time-lapse capture, as well as full manual camera settings, and its output options also offer a range of different choices.\nThis is easily the best consumer 360 camera I’ve tried out so far, because of its range of options, and the results of its photos and video, which are high quality for a device that doesn’t cost thousands of dollars. Insta360’s stabilization, stitching and companion app are all terrific, and make working and sharing with the content you capture super easy.\nThe Insta360 One also supports Facebook Live streaming, which is great if you want to show off a special event or concert, and its 1080p video export feature is convenient for capturing everything and then setting a frame for sharing later. You can even track a specific subject using a feature called “SmartTrack,” to tag a face and have a resulting 1080p non-surround video output as well.\n\nI also got to try it out with a Bluetooth remote and selfie stick that Insta360 plans to sell as accessories. There’s a forthcoming waterproof housing, too, that will turn this into an all-condition and even underwater camera, up to a depth of 30 meters. That’s definitely going to make it a constant vacation companion for me.\nThe world of 360 consumer cameras is admittedly getting a bit crowded, especially considering how many people are probably actually consuming 360 content. But the Insta360 One seems like a clear favorite now, even with its $299 price tag. There’s a lot of value in that price, and this is definitely my top recommendation right now if you’re looking to get into surround video and photos.\nOrders are up now for the Insta360 One, and it’ll start shipping on September 5, with accessories available later.

According to an FCC filing found by Dave Zatz, the company is seeking to get approval from the U.S. Government to sell a speaker that sports “integrated voice control functionality with far field microphones” and “multiple voice platforms.”\nIt’s impossible to say if Sonos is building in Alexa, but the company has been making moves as of late to play friendly with Amazon’s voice platform and in the past expressed plans to build the voice control platform into its speakers.\nBack in January the new CEO sent a memo to his staff challenging them to boldly innovate, and to partner with global leaders, which he named as Amazon, Google and “(likely) Apple.” Since then the company started rolling out services that links Sonos speakers with Alexa devices, allowing for voice control. This function is a start and great for current speakers, but the speaker shown in this FCC filing would take the integration to the logical conclusion.\nAccording to the FCC filing, the unreleased Sonos will have far-field microphones much like Amazon Echo devices. The speaker would also support multiple voice platforms and music services. Most of this report is redacted so the details mostly stop there.\nFor Sonos the best move would be to let users pick between Amazon, Google, and maybe, eventually, Apple’s home voice control assistant. That could be what is mentioned here, though since the speaker is still in testing, it’s unclear what function will eventually launch with the speaker.\nThe company could reveal more details at the upcoming CEDIA tradeshow in early September, which features home control, and audio and video companies.", "tags": "federal-communications-commission,speaker,technology,microphone", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/sonos-is-testing-a-speaker-with-a-mic-and-voice-control/", "id": "1532209"}, {"title": "BittBoy is a retro pocket console that does a lot for very little", "text": "The GameBoy Pocket remains one of the best-designed pieces of mobile gaming kit ever in my opinion, which is why I was intrigued by the BittBoy, a new third-party portable console that clearly owes a lot of inspiration to the GameBoy. The tiny handheld packs a library of “300” games built-in, controls that will feel familiar to any Nintendo fan, a battery you can recharge via microUSB and a 2.2-inch IPS display.\nFirst, let’s get to the highlights: This thing is super small. It’s only about 2.5 by 4 inches, and it’ll easily slip into just about any pocket. The battery also appears to last quite a while, even though it’s only 500 mAh; I’ve played for quite a few hours on a single charge without depleting it yet.\nThat screen is also pretty good, especially when compared to the screens of actual retro consoles. There are some issues with colors being rendered weird, but that’s the emulation software, not the display itself, as those color oddities carry over to TV output, too.\nSpeaking of TV output, that’s another strength – it ships with a simple mini stereo to RCA AV out, which can plug into any TV with one of those yellow round video inputs. It works, though the cable is somewhat short and the image flickers a bit if there’s much cable play, but it came in handy when spending time in a hotel and looking for something to do to pass some time.\nThe BittBoy’s biggest strength is its ability to go anywhere while taking up virtually no space in your kit, or adding any weight to your baggage. It’s so light you might actually forget you’re carrying it, as I have on occasion before emptying my pockets. The buttons and case, while not the most luxurious feeling in the world, also seem like they can take a fair amount of abuse before breaking down.\nBittBoy’s weaknesses are probably in its software library: It offers “300-in-1” games, but you probably aren’t going to want to play most of them. Plus, they’re emulated NES titles, so you have to be okay with that legal gray area.\n\nThere’s plenty enough there to sustain the attention of retro gaming fans, however – especially at $39.99, the retail price of BittBoy. But if you’re hoping to expand the library with your own software, look elsewhere, since there’s a microSD-looking slot on top but it’s not functional.\nBottom line: This is a fun stocking stuffer or add-on gift for the avid retro gamer in your life, and something that you can basically stick in a regularly used backpack as a fun surprise you can re-discover on long commutes or while traveling.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/bittboy-is-a-retro-pocket-console-that-does-a-lot-for-very-little/", "id": "1531969"}, {"title": "Petcube Bites is a capable canine companion for when you’re not home", "text": "Keep your dogs close but your kitties closer, is I think the expression. Maybe. Whatever it is, pets are important to people. And keeping a close watch on them even when you’re not located in the same place has become increasingly possible thanks to the broad proliferation of tech like Wi-Fi connected cameras. Petcube Bites is one of those cameras, but it’s also a treat dispenser, which lets you fire nibblets for your pet back at home from wherever you happen to be, provided you have an active internet connection.\nFair warning: This is a much larger unit than your average Nest or Logitech smart home camera. It’s roughly the size of a big encyclopedia, or a couple of Mac minis standing on their thin edge and stacked. The size is functional, however, since it houses a decent-sized reservoir for your stock of treats, as well as an HD camera, a Wi-Fi radio, and a mechanism for actually firing off those treats, with a user-selectable range of up to around 6 feet.\n\nPetcube Bites ships with a selection of all-natural treats included, so you can get started using it right away. My dog isn’t exactly discerning when it comes to what she eats (she ate half a pizza box the other day), but I can say that she happily scarfed these down.\nSetup of the Pectcube Bites is easy if you’ve ever installed any kind of Wi-Fi camera or connected home device before – and it should pose no problem even if you haven’t. It basically involves getting the unit connected to your Wi-Fi network using an app you download for your iOS or Android smartphone.\nOnce connected, the Bites will show up in the app, and you can connect to it to view a live feed from the camera, and to do additional stuff including initiating a two-way voice conversation if you feel like ‘talking’ to your pet. You can also trigger the dispensing of a treat, of course, and this is where the Bites departs from a more rudimentary two-way connected home camera.\n\nUsing the app, you simply flick up on the smartphone screen to launch a treat. Again, you can set the distance, and after. few seconds the treat will drop into the tray and then get kicked out across the room. I found this worked as designed pretty consistently, although once in a while two treats were dispensed instead of one, which is not really a huge issue, and probably would be described as a feature, not a bug, by my dog. You can also adjust portion sizes, and even set a dispensing schedule if you want them released at pre-set times.\nMy dog pretty quickly learned that the whirring of the little motor within the unit mean that a treat was on its way, so she would appear in frame just before the treat was launched almost every time I sent one her way. It’s amazing how fun it is to play that way with your pet when you have to be away from home.\nThere are some nice features the Petcube Bites offers beyond just the pet treat dispensing. It has motion detection, with notifications that push to your device (which you can turn off if you like). Video quality is also not bad at all, compared to comparatively priced dedicated home security cams. If you’ve got a pet and you’re already considering a Wi-Fi camera, this might be a better option in terms of value for money.\n\nOther advantages nice things about the Petcube Bites include the multiple installation options – you can either use the rubberized base to just sit it on a flat surface, or use the pre-drilled holes on the back to simply slot it over mounting screws in a wall. Again, it’s large, so having options in terms of how to use it is a nice benefit for anyone concerned with how well it will (or won’t) fit into their home decor.\nPetcube Bites is available in three color ways for $229.99 right now from Petcube direct.

It’s been reaching out to universities, military-industrial contractors, and of course the semiconductor and chip biz to explore the possibility, and this week was the “proposers’ day,” when the agency and interested parties share details and expectations.\nBasically the idea is to reduce certain functions to standard chiplet size and form factor, within reason, and create a system by which those chiplets can be organized into larger boards. Need a board that’s heavy on image processing and storage for a satellite or recon drone? Put a bunch of those pieces together. Want something more focused on low-latency signal processing and integrating input from multiple sensors? Forget the image stuff and snap in some other parts.\nA slide deck presented at the event this week (PDF) has lots more details, though since the project is still in early stages it’s all still pretty speculative.\nIt’s unclear what size or form the chiplets would take — that’s up to the creators, the innovators in that enormous village, to decide. It could be macro-level swapping in, like popping in extra RAM or a PCI card. Or it could be baked in at the manufacturing level but still more flexible than existing custom chip systems.\nIdeally, though, the resulting electronics would be smaller, more versatile, and cheaper to make and replace than current solutions — which wouldn’t be hard in some cases, with some military systems dating decades into the past.\nDARPA was keen to emphasize that it doesn’t want anything remade from scratch, merely retooling things to create a more flexible infrastructure. The old paradigm of the do-it-all PC isn’t the best any more in many cases. That may, however, mean establishing new interfaces or standards.\n\t\nDan Green, the program manager, had more winged words to utter for CHIPS:\n“Now we are moving beyond pretty pictures and mere words, and we are rolling up our sleeves to do the hard work it will take to change the way we think about, design, and build our microelectronic systems.”", "tags": "modular,darpa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/26/darpa-project-aims-to-make-modular-computers-out-of-chiplets/", "id": "1531816"}, {"title": "Pioneer’s AVH-2330NEX gives you both Android Auto and CarPlay — without a new car price tag", "text": "CarPlay and Android Auto can only really be described as what you’d call a “slow burn.” They both debuted quite a few years ago, but getting access to them via first-party infotainment systems didn’t happen with the pace early adopters might be accustomed to. Luckily, a variety of third-party aftermarket in-car audio and infotainment decks offer an option for those who don’t want to buy a new car or wait for their automaker of choice to catch up with the times.\nPioneer’s new AVH-2330NEX, which the company officially revealed in May this year and started shipping just recently, offers both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay in a single package, which is very convenient if you happen to spend time on both platforms. It also offers a CD/DVD slot, accessible via the sliding front faceplate, and a 7-inch resistive touchscreen with 800×480 screen resolution. Physical buttons are included below the display, as is Bluetooth for hands-free and stereo streaming.\nThe whole thing comes in a double-DIN package that will work with a wide range of vehicles, with or without trim kits depending on your car. It also can plug into factory steering wheel controls, as well as first-party and aftermarket backup cameras. The AVH-2330NEX also ships with its own microphone, which is great because, in my experience, it offered far better voice recognition for things like Google Assistant and Siri, as well as for calls, when compared with factory-installed microphones shipping on vehicles.\n\nAt $500, the AVH-2330NEX (and the AVH-2300NEX,which is the same minus the inclusion of HD radio support, a second camera input and remote control) is far cheaper than either buying a new car, or even in many cases paying for the infotainment upgrade package that will get you access to CarPlay and Android Auto in stock vehicles. It’s also a big boost for even factory sound systems, as it greatly improved the audio quality of both Bluetooth and wired music and podcast playback in my 2013 Nissan Rogue thanks to its built-in DAC.\nBut the real benefit here is access to your mobile OS of choice, right in your dash, front and center where you want it when driving. Plus, thanks to a standard USB adapter, you can switch between both using various cables, including micro-USB, USB-C and Lightning depending on your device’s requirements.\n\nI found that both CarPlay and Android Auto ran well on the Pioneer 2330NEX, and I encountered no issues with either during many hours of extensive testing. Text was large and legible on the 7-inch display, as were icons and other interface elements. Animations and transitions were smooth, too, and I never encountered any kind of lag, which can happen on underpowered infotainment systems running these in-car mobile software systems.\nThe other thing I was a bit wary of going into testing the AVH-2330NEX was the lack of a capacitive touchscreen. It uses a resistive unit instead, which historically hasn’t been as good for touch interfaces on electronic devices: That was one of the iPhone’s chief strengths, in fact — it brought capacitive touchscreens to mass-market mobile devices, offering a much better overall user experience.\nSurprisingly, the resistive screen made very little difference versus capacitive in-car units I’ve tried in the past. I never encountered errors with missed touch input, and the screen felt responsive enough. I suspect that’s a combination of the tech having advanced over the years and an infotainment deck not requiring the same high level of responsiveness as a smartphone in order to feel like it’s working properly.\n\nEither way, the resistive display works perfectly fine and keeps the cost down. It does, however, mean that the AVH-2330NEX has a plastic-covered display that does not do well in direct sunlight. In fact, that’s my single major complaint with the unit: The screen doesn’t look terrific in bright light. It’s still perfectly usable, but it’s not ideal.\nAside from CarPlay and Android Auto, the Pioneer AVH-2330NEX offers a lot of great features, including support for a backup camera. That also worked flawlessly in my testing, kicking in whenever I put my car in reverse. The steering wheel controls are also great (though that’ll depend a bit on your car make and model). One small caveat there, too: It’s unlikely you’ll be able to map your call button to Siri or Android Assistant, but the Pioneer deck itself has a dedicated hardware button with a mic label that lets you activate those at any time with relative ease and a minimum of distraction.\nThe Pioneer AVH-2330NEX offers what few products can: A new lease on life for older vehicles, especially for tech-focused users who want to experience the latest in infotainment convenience features but don’t want to have to buy a whole new car to do it.", "tags": "pioneer", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/pioneers-avh-2330nex-gives-you-both-android-auto-and-carplay-without-a-new-car-price-tag/", "id": "1527981"}, {"title": "Uber debuts new Uber for Business with custom travel programs and rules", "text": "Uber is introducing a major revamp of their Uber for Business platform today, the first significant update they’ve done since the enterprise tool’s introduction. The new Uber for Business incorporates a lot of user feedback to provide easy setting of rules to ensure travel policy is followed, as well as group-based access levels and custom program creation.\nPreviously, a lot of the heavy lifting on employee Uber use policies had to be done manually: HR would basically tell employees what they were and weren’t allowed to do in terms of Uber usage, and hope that employees would stick to the letter of the policies in place. Now, however, companies using Uber for Business can set those rules ahead of time to streamline the process of expensing rides, and ensure greater compliance.\nManagers can easily create programs that limit things like the type of car used, the total amount riders can expense, what time of day Uber can be used and even geographic limits on where it can be expensed. These rules can all be combined in custom programs, including things like First and Last Mile programs for commuters, recruiting and client travel programs, employee perks, and general travel transport expense programs.\nThese programs will display once a rider selects their business account, based on eligibility when they go to book a ride through the rider app as they would normally. Businesses can assign users to groups depending on their role, and can use those groups to define eligibility for specific programs.\nIf a rider’s travel could fall out of policy, say for a trip that goes beyond the available credit in an employee perk program, they’ll be prompted to add their own payment method so that they can complete the journey while still staying fair of their company’s rules. It’s a system that takes into account both user convenience and the concerns of expense compliance teams in a way that benefits both in the end.\nUber has also redesigned the manager-facing backed for Uber for Business, making it easier to use. That includes incorporating Uber Central directly into the interface, so that approved managers can manage and assign rides for clients, customers, freelancer, recruits and others not directly covered by the existing policies in place.\nOverall, this is a great redesign with new features that make it very easy to implement and use for businesses of all sizes, and managers of all levels of technical expertise.

The idea behind Macie is to use machine learning to help businesses protect their sensitive data in the cloud. For now, you can use Macie to protect personally identifiable information and intellectual property in the Amazon S3 storage service, with support for other AWS data stores coming later this year (likely at the re:Invent conference in November).\n\nThe company says the fully managed service uses machine learning to monitor how data is accessed and to look for any anomalies. The service then alerts users of any activity that looks suspicious so they can find the root cause of any data leaks (whether those are malicious or not). To do all of this, the service continuously monitors new data that comes into S3. It then uses machine learning to understand regular access patterns and the data in the storage bucket.\nThe service also automatically detects certain data types like full names, addresses, credit card numbers, IP addresses, driver license IDs (U.S. only), social security numbers and birth dates, but it also can automatically detect different content types (email, SEC forms, data logs, database backups, source code, etc.).\nAll of this data then flows into a central dashboard that highlights high-risk files and other information about how users and other applications are accessing data.\n\nAs with all AWS services, pricing is complicated, but mostly based on the number of events and data the service processes every month. Because a lot of costs are bound to the initial classification of the data, the first month of usage is also likely the most expensive.\nFor now, Macie is only available in AWS’s U.S. East (Northern Virginia) and U.S. West (Oregon) regions, though this footprint will likely expand over time.\nIt’s worth noting that Amazon also announced that Glue, the company’s service for preparing and loading data into its various database and storage services, is now available to all customers.

His key takeaway from all the socializing with tech leaders is that the Department of Defense needs to embrace technology coming out of the private sector if it hopes to stay ahead of the technological curve.\nIn a briefing before Mattis’ media address at DiuX, Sean Singleton, director of business development for the unit, explained that commercial R&D is outpacing federal R&D at a rate of nearly three to one. And companies like Amazon and Alphabet spend more on R&D than traditional military contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.\nTo stop the military from falling behind the times, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental works with startups to accelerate commercial innovation for national defense. DiuX provides non-dilutive capital to companies willing to work with the government to solve specific problems. The group’s work is similar to In-Q-Tel, a VC firm that brings the CIA closer together with tech companies.\nThe unit is focused on autonomy, AI, human systems/life sciences, information technology/cyber and space. But of those five investment areas, AI remains a key enabling technology for all of them. And Secretary Mattis was the first to admit that he sees many of the greatest advances in AI happening in the private sector.\n“The bottom line is we will get better at integrating the advances in AI that are being taken here in the Valley into the U.S. military,” Secretary Mattis told reporters at the DiuX briefing.\nUnderscoring this point, Singleton told the story of DiuX managing director Raj Shah going into the desert with Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet. The two observed archaic processes for planning out tanker routes for jets with Schmidt insisting that the problem was fixable with technology, it just needed attention.\nTo date, DiuX has invested in Quid, Saildrone, Orbital Insight, Shield AI and more. These companies don’t solely produce products and services for the U.S. Government, but they promise to dedicate resources to address public sector priority problems.\nFor example, Shield AI drones can scan a house in a military context to identify threats. The drones and accompanying software also can serve the private sector, monitoring oil and gas fields and surveying construction sites.\nDiuX currently has four offices across the United States, in Cambridge, Mass., Mountain View, Calif., Washington, D.C., and Austin.

But even with just one job to do, I’ve never seen a service that can handle the long tail of vocabulary used in the real world. This is particularly challenging if you’re a startup trying to sell your service to enterprises that rely on accurate transcription for their operations.\nJon Goldsmith, co-founder of Tetra, a voice transcription startup, understands this challenge — in fact, he is even willing to admit that he hasn’t 100 percent cracked the problem. But Goldsmith believes the answer lies in deep learning, and he’s setting out to prove it with a $1.5 million seed round led by Amplify Partners, with participation from Y Combinator and a number of angels.\nI dropped by the Tetra office to check out what Goldsmith, his co-founder Nik Liolios and one other engineer had created. Goldsmith gave me a call using his smartphone with the Tetra app installed. As he and the deep learning models running in the background listened, I threw out a barrage of challenges for the transcription service.\nSpeaking at varying speeds, throwing out numbers, startup names and other tough words did stump Tetra to some degree — but to be fair, there is no AI that I haven’t broken. Given how easy Tetra is to use, I could see it being used as a backup reference or for record keeping — turn it on, forget about it and use it to search through notes later.\nIn cases where 99 or 100 percent accuracy is required, Tetra offers human transcription for a fee and a 24-hour wait. This actually helps both customers and Tetra in the sense that accurate transcriptions can feed back as training data to improve future performance.\nGoldsmith told me he is finding traction selling to investors making frequent diligence calls. These customers want Tetra to create a permanent record of conversations with industry experts. Other, more traditional, enterprise use cases exist as well, like within sales.\nThis seems to be working out fairly well for the company. And things remain fairly lean with the three-person Tetra team working out of a residential apartment dually zoned for commercial. On the engineering side, a lot of the underlying infrastructure is being powered by off-the-shelf APIs.\nThis is actually a good thing, because it means Tetra isn’t wasting time building things that already exist on the market and instead is focusing on collecting a massive transcriptions data set that will only continue to improve the quality of the service moving forward.\nThe team’s approach is heavily dependent on being able to optimize which parts of conversations are sent to which cloud API. For example, some NLP service providers are better at understanding speech relating to movies, music and media, while others are better at numbers, etc.\nThe $1.5 million in seed financing is going to be used to scale up the engineering team and improve machine learning pipelines.

For them, issues like throughput, latency, governance and confidentiality are still major stumbling blocks for using blockchains. With its new Coco Framework, Microsoft wants to solve these issues and make blockchains more suitable for the enterprise.\nIn an interview earlier this week, Microsoft’s CTO for Azure (and occasional novelist) Mark Russinovich told me the company is seeing a lot of interest in blockchain technology among its users. They like the general idea of a distributed ledger, but a system that can only handle a handful of transactions a second doesn’t work for them — what they want is a technology that can handle a thousand or more transactions per second.\nThe Coco Framework solves these fundamental issues with blockchains by introducing a trusted execution environment (TEE). The basic idea here is that you have a trusted box on which you can trust to put your blockchain code. That trust is established through tools like Intel’s Software Guard Extensions or Windows’ Virtual Secure Mode — and because it’s an open framework, it can also support other TEEs as they become available. With these TEEs you can then build a network of trusted enclaves that all agree on the ledger and Coco code they are running (it’s a concept Intel and others have also experimented with in the past).\nOnce you have these trusted enclaves, all the other pieces fall into place. Because you can trust the updates to the ledger, you don’t need to perform any proof of work, which greatly increases the transaction speed. In a typical ledger, that would take seconds or even minutes. But with the enclaves, that’s not an issue, and Microsoft says Coco and Ethereum can handle up to 1,600 transactions per second in its prototype setup. Thanks to this, the blockchain network — when combined with a protocol like Paxos for ensuring consistency — becomes a usable database.\nEnterprises also want to ensure that one of their suppliers can’t see the orders you placed with another supplier. That’s a hard problem to solve when your ledger is public. Coco, however, adds a confidentiality layer on top of a ledger like Ethereum (or any other ledger, because the framework is ledger-agnostic). Enabling this only took some minor addition to the Ethereum protocol in Microsoft’s prototype.\nAnother feature Coco enables is governance. To explain this, Russinovich used the example of a bank consortium that wants to use a blockchain network. Who gets to add another bank to this network? The Coco governance system allows the members of the consortium to set up rules for voting on decisions like this.\nWhat’s important here is that the Coco Framework will be compatible with any ledger protocol and can run virtually anywhere — in the cloud or on premises, and on any operating system and hypervisor that supports a compatible trusted environment. R3 Corda, the Intel-incubated Hyperledger Sawtooth and J.P. Morgan Quorum will integrate their distributed ledgers with Coco.\n“We are thrilled to work with Microsoft to bring blockchain to the enterprise,” said Rick Echevarria, vice president, Software and Services Group and General Manager, Platforms Security Division at Intel, in today’s announcement. “Our mutual customers are excited by the potential of blockchain. Intel is committed to accelerating the value of blockchains powered by Azure on Intel hardware, by improving the scalability, privacy and security of the solutions based on our technologies.”\nDon’t get too excited yet, though. It’ll be early 2018 before Microsoft will open source the code for Coco. Russinovich tells me the team is still hardening the code and getting it ready for open sourcing.

By joining Google, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat and just about every company that matters in the space, AWS has acknowledged that when it comes to container management, standards matter.\nAWS has been known to go the proprietary route, after all. When you’re that big and powerful, and control vast swaths of market share as AWS does, you can afford to go your own way from time to time. Containers is an area it hasn’t controlled, though. That belongs to Kubernetes, the open source container management tool originally developed inside Google.\nAWS was smart enough to recognize that Kubernetes is becoming an industry standard in itself, and that when it comes to build versus buy versus going open source, AWS wisely recognized that battle has been fought and won.\nOnce it recognized Google’s dominance in container management, the next logical step was to join the CNCF and adhere to the same container standards the entire industry is using. Sometimes it’s better to switch than fight, and this was clearly one of those times.\nWhat we have now is a clearer path to containerization, a technology that is all the rage inside large companies — for many good reasons. They allow you to break down the application into discrete manageable chunks, making updates a heck of a lot easier, and clearly dividing developer tasks and operations tasks in a DevOps model.\nStandards provide a common basis for managing containers. Everyone can build their own tools on top of them. Google already has when it built Kubernetes, Red Hat has OpenShift, Microsoft makes Azure Container Service — and so forth and so on.\nCompanies like standards because they know the technology is going to work a certain way, regardless of who built it. Each vendor provides a similar set of basic services, then differentiates itself based on what it builds on top.\nTechnology tends to take off once a standard is agreed upon by the majority of the industry. Look at the World Wide Web. It has taken off because there is a standard way of building web sites. When companies agree to the building blocks, everything else seems to fall into place.\nA lack of standards has traditionally held back technology. Having common building blocks just make sense.

It also supports Docker, a popular container platform,  and adheres to the Open Container Initiative, a set of industry standards for containers, according to the company.\nAs companies make the shift from virtual machines to containers, there is an increasing need for platforms like OpenShift, and Red Hat is seeing massive interest from companies as varying as Deutsche Bank, Volvo and United Health.\nOpenShift is a technology that’s helping these companies, and many others make that transition to containers, says Joe Fernandes, senior director of product management for OpenShift at Red Hat. “The adoption of container technology is off the charts. Pretty much every company is adopting containers in some way,” he said.\nAs the company increases its container customer base, it’s trying to build out the platform to meet the needs of larger company IT departments.

Tableau expects to integrate this technology with its own products as it looks to make it easier for its users to use similar queries to visualize their data.\nTypically, you’d have to know SQL or a similar database query language to pull information out of most enterprise databases. Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning now allow services like ClearGraph to understand more about the underlying database and then take these sentences and essentially translate them into database queries.

Ramakrishnan was soon convinced that Gallivan was the perfect fit to take over the CEO duties at BlueJeans. First, he had to talk Gallivan into leaving his position as CEO at Pentaho, the data and analytics company he had been running for over five years.\nAs the two talked, Gallivan discovered that Ramakrishnan was looking to take on a different role.

That’s where Salesforce’s latest Einstein artificial intelligence feature comes into play.\nToday the company introduced Einstein Vision for Social Studio, which provides a way for marketers to search for pictures related to their brands on social media in the same way they search for other mentions. The product takes advantage of a couple of Einstein artificial intelligence algorithms including Einstein Image Classification for image recognition. It uses visual search, brand detection and product identification. It also makes use of Einstein Object Detection to recognize objects within images including the type and quantity of object.\nAI has gotten quite good at perception and cognition tasks in recent years. One result of this has been the ability to train an algorithm to recognize a picture. With cheap compute power widely available and loads of pictures being uploaded online, it provides a perfect technology combination for better image recognition.\nRob Begg, VP of product marketing for social and advertising products at Salesforce, says it’s about letting the machine loose on tasks for which it’s better suited. “If you think of it from a company point of view, there is a huge volume of tweets and [social] posts. What AI does best is help surface and source the ones that are relevant,” he says.\nAs an example, he says there could be thousands of posts about cars, but only a handful of those would be relevant to your campaign. AI can help find those much more easily.\nBegg sees three possible use cases for this tool. First of all, it could provide better insight into how people are using your products. Secondly it could provide a way to track brand displays online hidden within pictures, and finally it could let you find out when influencers such as actors or athletes are using your products.\nThe product comes trained to recognize two million logos, 60 scenes (such as an airport), 200 foods and 1000 objects.

Today IBM is firing back with some numbers of its own. IBM’s research groups says it was able to train ResNet-50 for 1k classes in 50 minutes across 256 GPUs — which is effectively just the polite way of saying “my model trains faster than your model.” Facebook noted that with Caffe2 it was able to train a similar ResNet-50 model in one hour on 256 GPUs using an 8k mini-batch approach.\nThis would be a natural moment to question why any of this matters in the first place. Distributed processing is a big sub-field of AI research, but it’s also quite arcane. Computing jobs are often so big for deep learning problems that they are most efficiently handled across a large number of GPUs instead of just a single GPU.\nBut as you add more GPUs, training time doesn’t naturally scale down. For example, you might assume that if it took two minutes to train with one GPU it would take one minute to train with two GPUs. In the real world it doesn’t work like this because there is some cost to splitting up and recombining complex quantitative operations.\nWhat IBM is promising is the most efficient distributed deep learning library for breaking up a giant deep learning problem into hundreds of smaller deep learning problems. This all might seem petty in the context of a single compute job, but remember that companies like IBM and Facebook are training models all day, every day for millions of customers. Every major tech company has a stake in this, but it’s often tough to compare results companies promise because of the sheer number of variables in any research effort.\nNow you would be right to question the future meaningfulness of obsessing on incremental increases in distributed scaling efficiency — and you’d be right. Hillery Hunter, director of systems acceleration and memory at IBM Research, tells me that everyone is getting really close to optimal.\n“You have gotten about as much as you can out of the system and so we believe we are close to optimal. The question is really the rate at which we keep seeing improvements and whether we are still going to see improvements in the overall learning times.”\nIBM didn’t stop with just the ResNet-50 results.

There are a lot of reasons why neural approaches show more promise than phrase-based approaches, but the bottom line is that they produce more accurate translations.\nTraditional machine translation is a fairly explicit process. Relying on key phrases, phrase-based systems translate sentences then probabilistically determine a final translation. You can think of this in a similar light as using the Rosetta Stone (identical phrases in multiple languages) to translate text.\nIn contrast, neural models deal in a higher level of abstraction. The interpretation of a sentence becomes part of a multi-dimensional vector representation, which really just means we’re trying to translate based on some semblance of “context” rather than phrases.\nIt’s not a perfect process, and researchers are still tinkering with how to deal with long-term dependencies (i.e. retaining understanding and accuracy throughout a long text), but the approach is incredibly promising and has produced great results, thus far, for those implementing it.\nGoogle announced the first stage of its move to neural machine translation in September 2016 and Microsoft made a similar announcement two months later. Facebook has been working on its conversion efforts for about a year and it’s now at full deployment. Facebook AI Research (FAIR) published its own research on the topic back in May and open sourced its CNN models on GitHub.\n“Our problem is different than that of most of the standard places, mostly because of the type of language we see at Facebook,” Necip Fazil Ayan, engineering manager in Facebook’s language technologies group, explained to me in an interview. “We see a lot of informal language and slang acronyms. The style of language is very different.”\nFacebook has seen about a 10 percent jump in translation quality. You can read more into the improvement in FAIR’s research.

In an interview with TechCrunch this week, CEO and co-founder Rob Frohwein declined to name a specific number but said that this latest investment was at a “meaningful upround” that was more than $1.25 billion but not quite $2 billion.\nFounded in Atlanta in 2009, Kabbage was an early mover in the concept of using big data analytics to underwrite and monitor loans: the company draws on hundreds of sources of information, from a company’s or individual’s public social media profiles and a business’s QuickBooks accounts, through to larger macro data sets, to decide whether or not to loan money (and how much to loan).\nAt a time when a number of other online small business lenders like OnDeck and Can Capital have stumbled under iffy business models, amid a wider shakedown in the online loan industry overall, Kabbage has grown. Frohwein attributes this squarely to its big data play, which collectively now crunches some 1.5 million data connections to help make decisions.\n“When the proverbial shit hit the fan in the online lending space a little while back, people at Kabbage were nervous. All I said was, ‘finally!'” Frohwein recalled. “What’s happened is that now we have some separation between companies that were not focused on building differentiated solutions and those that are trying to do something different. We’ve gotten past the point of puffery. A small handful of companies have differentiated themselves and I think Kabbage is one of those.”\nHe said that Kabbage is profitable in its loans business, but not yet in its platform operation — the latter is a newer division launched in 2015 that essentially powers other lending businesses, alongside Kabbage’s own retail operation. (Customers include Kabbage itself, which has a Karrot consumer loans business; as well as major banks like ING, Santander and Scotiabank.) “As a company, we will be profitable in Q4 from a GAAP perspective,” he said.\nWhile Kabbage’s big data formula is today used by several other fintech companies — they include Kreditech (which focuses on helping to create credit scores for people who are “unbanked” and is backed by Peter Thiel and Naspers), Fundbox (also with a long list of interesting investors including Jeff Bezos) and BlueVine (backed by Citi Group, among others) — Kabbage plans to take its own data play to the next level.\nOne area will be loans for specific verticals or types of businesses: the idea here is that if you are a construction business or a restaurant, you are likely to have very different cash flows, so Kabbage would like to develop ways of making the loans more personalised and less full of default and friction that can easily be avoided if the lender understands more about the borrower.\nToday, Kabbage already claims stronger customer loyalty than many other lenders: Frohwein said that on average its customers borrow 20 times from Kabbage over three to four years: he claimed that as a point of comparison the industry average is 2.2 times.\nWe should also keep an eye out for acquisitions and completely new product launches from the company. Some have suggested it might try to buy OnDeck in a consolidation play, but our sources say this was just speculation and that a more likely scenario would be acquiring companies to add new services to the platform, rather than as a consolidation play among similar competitors.\nAsked about this, Frohwein would not specify what new product launches or acquisitions might come first, but he highlighted payments as an interesting area.\n“Look at how PayPal and square have both gone from being payments companies to small business lenders,” he noted. “There is a clear connection between how companies think about those two business areas, so it’s not a giant leap of faith for us to consider this.”\nWhile SoftBank has been making some major waves in the investment world lately with huge investments out of its new $100 billion Vision Fund, this latest effort with Kabbage comes from the SoftBank Group directly (and somehow $250 million sounds suddenly modest when you are thinking about $100 billion). From what I understand, it could potentially get rolled into the Vision Fund later down the line, but for now it represents some very interesting strategic opportunities for Kabbage.\nThose could come in two general forms. First, there is expansion of Kabbage’s retail and platform businesses further into Asia (where it’s only so far worked as a white-label platform partner).\nSecond, there is the opportunity to work with a myriad of SoftBank’s portfolio companies. Nothing announced so far on this front, but recall that SoftBank’s diverse holdings include Sprint (which has a large number of small business customers); Lyft and a number of other ride-sharing startups (another business line that relies heavily on very small businesses: sole traders); SoFi; and many more.\nIn that regard, SoftBank’s investment looks like a smart bet placed on a company that it believes it could leverage throughout its network in some interesting ways.\n“SoftBank invests in market-leading companies that dramatically improve the customer experience and expand markets through breakthrough technology and data capabilities,” said SoftBank Managing Director David Thevenon, in a statement. “We invested in Kabbage because their unique automated lending platform leverages open data networks and best positions them to empower small businesses around the world.”", "tags": "loans,small-business,smbs,kabbage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/small-business-loan-platform-kabbage-nabs-250m-from-softbank/", "id": "1522907"}, {"title": "Redkix, an email-friendly team messaging platform, launches its public beta", "text": "When you first look at Redkix, it looks like any other Slack clone, but while you could definitely use it just like Slack, the team offers an important twist on the standard company chat theme: it plays nice with email. After a year of private testing with about 7,000 users, the team is opening up its public beta today and launching its paid premium program in private beta.\nOudi Antebi, Redkix’s CEO and co-founder, told me that one of his main theses for building Redkix was that collaboration software only works when you have 100 percent participation inside a company. “All you need is one person to ruin the party for everyone else,” he said. In addition, users don’t want to have to switch back and forth between their inbox and their chat tools.\nTo solve this, the team decided to make email a core feature of Redkix. That means the service features both an email inbox for your work email and you can use the regular chat window to talk to users — maybe outside of your company — who only use email. Redkix simply aggregates your messages to them and sends them out as an email and when they respond, their answers show up in a chat channel, too. The overall experience is pretty intuitive and straightforward, though there’s obviously a tiny bit of lag before the service parses incoming emails.\n\nOne feature Antebi is especially proud of is threads on Redkix. If you’re a regular Slack users, then you know that this remains an unsolved problem in chat apps (and Slack’s solution still feels clunky to me). Redkix threads live inside their channels but feel more like separate entities that are easier to keep track of than their Slack counterparts.\nAntebi also stressed that Redkix will soon be ISO 27001 certified and that the company plans to get Soc 2, Soc 3 and HIPAA certifications, too. This clearly speaks to the company’s ambition in the enterprise space, where having these kind of enterprise-level security and privacy certifications are table stakes.\nLooking ahead, we’ll like see support for video and audio chats as well, though it’s unclear when exactly this will happen.\nThe new premium “Teams” tier, which will cost $6 per user and month, is now also available in private beta. The playbook here also sounds quite similar to Slack’s. Users pay for having unlimited team members (the free version is restricted to 10) and an unlimited chat and email histories, as well as a larger file storage allotment (10GB). Later on, the team also plans to launch an enterprise version with support for on-premise content storage, advanced encryption and support for Active Directory sync.\nNative apps for the service are currently available on Windows and MacOS, as well as on the iPhone. The Android app is still in private beta for now and a web-based version of Redkix is launching soon.\nWith about $20 million in funding to date, plans to grow the team to 60 people by the end of the year and offices in Israel and the U.S., Redkix is clearly planning for growth. How well the company will do in what is an increasingly saturated market for collaboration tools remains to be seen, but its slick email integration may just put it over the top when it goes out to sell its services to enterprises.", "tags": "collaboration,redkix", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/redkix-an-email-friendly-team-messaging-platform-launches-its-public-beta/", "id": "1522135"}, {"title": "HP’s new Nvidia-powered backpack VR PC is designed for work, not play", "text": "HP has a new entrant in that most curious PC niche – the backpack computer. A product of the virtual reality computing wave, the backpack PC provides all the power needed to drive high-quality VR headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, but with a form factor that allows the user to roam about untethered. The new HP Z VR Backpack is a bit different from the rest of the field, though, since it’s designed specifically as a workstation.\nThe HP Z contains an Nvidia Quadro P5200 GPU, and it’s the first time the mobile workstation-class graphics card has been used in a VR backpack to date. The whole outfit weighs in at 10 lbs, and the GPU’s capabilities allow it to run complex simulations and of course power top-end VR experiences, all delivered with cordless performance thanks to a built-in battery.\n\nHP is looking to start shipping the Z VR in September, with a starting price of $3,299 and additional options available for additional cost. It’s also getting a companion dock that allows you to use it more like a traditional desktop for those times when you don’t need to be roaming around immersed in virtual environments.\n\nThis whole thing might sound like a bit of a boondoggle, but one of the most interesting potential use cases for VR is actually in engineering and design, where the ability to prototype virtually and make changes prior to creating full-scale physical models can save a lot of time and effort. Companies like Lucid, which is hoping to bring a Tesla Model S competitor to market, are already demonstrating how VR can help cut down on pre-production expense.\nThe Z VR would also be useful for job training, HP suggests, and for fields like telemedicine and even commercial VR experience centers.

Today, it announced the bi-annual update to its Oracle Cloud Applications Suite.\nThis is update number 13 for those keeping score at home. The suite includes a range of enterprise software including ERP (think back-office management), HR and CRM/CX (for customer management). While there were a number of changes across the individual pieces, the entire suite got a fresh design.\nThe latest version certainly has a more modern look and feel, and that was the idea, says Steve Miranda, executive vice president of applications development at Oracle. Miranda says it’s a brand new experience compared to the previous version of the software. The company not only overhauled the design, it also wanted to improve workflows, working to take out unnecessary steps when possible.\nWhat’s more, Oracle has turned to a responsive design approach, where the interface adjusts depending on screen size. It’s a marked improvement over the previous mobile experience, Miranda says, which used different colors and visualizations and a different navigation paradigm. He says previously they had some apps designed specifically for mobile, but some simply were presented in the browser, and didn’t always translate well to a smaller screen. Today’s update is designed to address that.\n \nAs for the ERP piece, the company enhanced the supply chain software that enables companies to track supplies in a manufacturing process. In the CX customer cloud, the company is adding brand new functionality that has been designed to improve communication between sales and marketing, a challenge that seems to face just about every organization, and one which vendors are forever working to resolve.\nAs Oracle more fully embraces the cloud, it’s adding new functionality and expanding the product set whenever possible, and this update appears to reflect that. It’s worth noting that Miranda says the company still maintains an on-prem version of the suite, but the cloud version with the twice yearly updates is now the more popular.

The latest investment brings the total raised to $21.1 million to date, and is part of an 18 month stretch in which the company went from seed to Series A to Series B.\nThe idea behind ProoV is to provide a place for companies to conduct proofs of concept with startups quickly and efficiently. Most larger companies want to find ways to use more modern tools, but they are often stuck for a variety of reasons including lack of internal resources to run a PoC, regulatory hurdles around using customer data for testing purposes and skepticism that the startup can deliver what it’s promising. ProoV is supposed to help alleviate all of that by offering a platform of services for building and executing a proof of concept project.\nThe company has built a platform that is part app store and part PoC service engine. Enterprise customers can connect with any of the 1000 approved startups and conduct proofs of concept using data ProoV has built, which is itself based on the way the customer structures its data sets. This saves the customer from using live customer data and should settle any regulatory issues.\nSo far, the company has 125 enterprise customers including big names like GE, Amazon Web Services and AIG using the platform.\nProoV makes money in a number of ways including charging a fee for the startups to be included on the platform. The majority of the revenue, however, comes from enterprise customers, who pay a subscription fee for access to the platform (and the startups listed there) and then a per proof of concept price. The company is experimenting with different ways of mixing and matching subscription and usage pricing.\nFor now, the plan is to use this round’s money to set up a new office in New York City and hire 15 salespeople to try to drive growth.

(Latch argues having an “intent signal”, such as voice or a tap, is more secure than ‘passive unlock’ approaches, just based on proximity detection.)\nThe smart lock includes Bluetooth, Wi-fi and NFC, as well as a wide-angle camera, a touchscreen and additional sensor tech to support its various capabilities — including unlocking doors with smartphones, keycards and doorcodes (supporting shared and temporary access, such as with delivery providers); and enabling the monitoring and managing of guest access (through camera and digital log). Also still present: a traditional key slot should a user prefer to continue packing metal.\nThe Latch C is designed to be installed on individual apartment doors that are equipped with a deadbolt, whereas Latch’s first product, the Latch M, works with mortise locks. This March the company also announced the Latch R: a reader-style electronic access product for building entrances, including lobby turnstiles and elevators.\nWith all three products co-founder Luke Schoenfelder says Latch is able to address a full spectrum of multi-unit and residential buildings across the U.S. — noting, for example, that “in some geographies, particularly in the American south and in some places in California, they use deadbolts in apartment buildings more than they use mortise locks”.\nThe Latch C could also be installed by building operators that lease standalone individual houses — with Schoenfelder pointing to the likes of Invitation Homes, which leases 50,000 homes across the U.S., as another type of potential customer for its sales pitch. (It’s worth noting Latch counts a number of funds from the real estate sector among its investors as strategic backers.)\n“The mortise product [Latch M] is required by law in most major urban markets… and now, with the C, we’re able to work on any apartment door in the U.S. — so this really just completes the suite,” says Schoenfelder.\n“For places that don’t require mortise locks they still have really stringent fire and building code requirements, and so the C is a deadbolt product that actually meets those requirements. We’re really the first smart lock deadbolt to meet those requirements.”\n \nIn an interesting development last month, Latch inked a deal with online retailer Jet to split the cost of installing its R smart locks on 1,000 urban residential buildings (with a total of 100,000 occupants) — revealing a strategy for growth that’s focused on selling smart access as an enabler of other, already in-demand digital services.\nLatch presumably won Jet’s financial (and marketing) buy-in by pitching its smart access product as an enabler of Jet’s ecommerce — making it easier for the e-tailer to deliver to more customers (e.g. people in multi-apartment buildings without a receptionist or doorman to take parcels).\nThough it’s also notable that Latch is part-funding some installations itself — to try to prime the pump for enterprise smart access in the residential buildings sector.\nIts overarching thesis for targeting buildings owners/operators vs trying to convince consumers there’s value in the faff (and risk) of installing and maintaining a smart lock themselves, is that b2b offers the ability to accelerate uptake and buy-in of the technology and its benefits as deployments happen in large-scale chunks.\nSo while individual consumers may well remain sceptical about handling the cost of a smart lock themselves, building owners and operators can offer reassuringly certified smart access as a value-add service to their tenants, incentivized by the prospect of happier tenants who value the ability to receive Jet deliveries or Amazon parcels, or share temporary access to their home with their babysitter, and so on.\nAlbeit, if Latch’s product ends up making it easier for tenants to sublet apartments via home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb the startup may face something of a balancing act to manage competing interests. After all, putting a smart lock on a door is really an invitation to a whole range of new behaviors — and while landlords may be happy to indulge some of them, others may prove a sticking point.\n“The next generation of consumers, many of them are not going to own their own homes. And are not going to own their own homes for quite a bit of time. And so the desire to bring the HomeKit experience to them is one of the really exciting things about this partnership,” says Schoenfelder. “We’re able to bring this HomeKit experience to products and spaces that otherwise you wouldn’t be able to have because if you don’t own your own place you’re not able to install a smart lock.”\nHe goes so far as to couch it as Latch giving Apple “a unique opportunity to bring HomeKit to an enterprise context”.\n“Whereas, before, HomeKit has been really about a small group of users interacting with a product in a single family home, this allows us to have these really rich, many, many users to a single device [scenario]. So you can have one common area door that now 250 people are using, so you’re getting that exposure to this ecosystem and to the possibilities in a really magnified way.\n“We’re really excited to align with [Apple’s] vision for — and to help further — what the vision of the modern building looks,” he adds.\nThe Latch C is priced at $299 per lock, plus the cost of a Latch subscription software plan service. Latch is taking pre-orders for the C now, with the first buildings due to receive the device this fall, according to Schoenfelder. (He won’t break out overall sales metrics across all the Latch locks as yet — claiming only that “they’re good”.)\nThe startup, which includes two ex-Apple employees among its three co-founders (Schoenfelder; and chief design officer Thomas Meyerhoffer), has raised a total of $26M since being founded in 2014 — most recently topping up its Series A with a further $10M this May.", "tags": "homekit,smart-access,smart-lock,latch", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/latch-adds-homekit-approved-smart-lock-to-its-enterprise-suite/", "id": "1528962"}, {"title": "Big data analytics platform Databricks raises $140M Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz", "text": "Databricks, a big data analytics platform built by a team that grew out of the Apache Spark project, today announced that it has raised a $140 million Series D round led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from New Enterprise Associates and Battery Ventures.

The latter went public, initially popping around 20 percent, though it’s had a middling time in the past month or so. The former is said to be raising financing at a $1.3 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.\nRedis Labs has raised $86 million in financing to date.", "tags": "cloudera,docker,goldman-sachs,redis-labs", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/in-memory-database-provider-redis-labs-raises-44m/", "id": "1529290"}, {"title": "GoodTime nabs $2M to match job applicants with interviewers to save time and build rapport", "text": "Despite countless attempts and millions in venture capital, the calendar, one of the most ubiquitous work tools, has remained largely unchanged for as long as I can remember. Rather than overwrite the calendar in an effort to make it obsolete, Ahryun Moon, Jasper Sone and Peter Lee, co-founders of GoodTime, are putting the calendar front and center — embracing it as a means of understanding people.\nWith $2 million from a seed financing round led by Big Basin Capital and Walden Venture Capital, GoodTime’s big vision is manifesting itself initially as an HR tool. With a dash of natural language processing, GoodTime is helping recruiting teams match job applicants with the right interviewers.\nIn competitive hiring environments, appropriately pairing a top candidate with an interviewer sharing prior work experience or university affiliation might be the difference maker in convincing that person to take the job. Of course, this idea isn’t new; recruiters typically spend significant portions of their time manually checking calendars to coordinate schedules and matchmake.\n“I met a recruiter from CoinBase who spends half her day scheduling interviews,” Moon told me.\nGoodTime integrates with applicant tracking systems to obtain information on candidates. This data is then paired with basic details about current employees. This information isn’t particularly hard to extract, but it does come from myriad unexpected places — spreadsheets, assorted documents and the like.\n“Often in AI, people think about machines replicating what a human would be doing,” Sone said of others in the ecosystem taking a more bot-centric approach. “We found out that even though that’s a cool application, candidates don’t want to spend more time going back and forth.”\nAll of this is helpful and it saves recruiters loads of time, but it’s only a small part of GoodTime’s vision. The other half of the problem is digging through calendars to differentiate critical meetings from junk reminders and other unimportant calendar items.\nWe all are guilty of filling in our calendars in such a way that they only make sense to us. Email reminders get placed next to eclipse reminders and we block off time for optional all-hands conference calls even when we have no intention of attending.\nUnfortunately, this makes it really hard for a machine to automatically schedule and optimize interviews. So the team is working on adding functionality that will interpret the importance of calendar items. With a human in the loop, GoodTime would be able to bump an important interview above a birthday reminder by classifying events into categories.\nGoodTime has managed to rack up a number of early users. Airbnb is paying to use the platform to coordinate its engineering interviews. The company also has found product market fit working with Stripe, Thumbtack and others. Some of these use cases have involved helping to diversify interview panels as well.\nAnd beyond just HR, the team sees potential in the calendar as a means of helping people optimize their days. The startup is looking to make some key hires in sales and engineering, particularly around machine learning.", "tags": "moon,business,calendar,economy", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/goodtime-nabs-2m-to-match-job-applicants-with-interviewers-to-save-time-and-build-rapport/", "id": "1529058"}, {"title": "LiftIgniter raises $6.4M to bring website personalization to the rest of the internet", "text": "You’ve probably had the experience of going to a website and seeing a lot of content that’s not really relevant. For the most part, a lot of this is organized in a way that’s either pre-defined or based on a limited number of signals that aims to sort of personalize the experience for a normal user.\nBut as time goes on and the competition for eyeballs continues to heat up, that light level of personalization probably won’t be enough. Instead, users can go to Facebook or Amazon, which have an enormous amount of data on its users, to get a much more personalized experience. Every other site that wants the attention of users needs to have a better-curated experience, and that’s what LiftIgniter is hoping to help those sites achieve. The company is raising $6.4 million in a round led by Storm Ventures. LiftIgniter has raised $8.25 million to date and was a finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016.\nThe goal is that the software will help customize the content on any given page for a specific user, which, hopefully, makes their experience more enjoyable. Those users may then end up either coming back over and over or eventually converting to customers and buying products. It’s all designed to create a more engaging experience, which in the end will help drive additional business to these sites through either more customer conversions or simply more unique visits and page views. LiftIgniter services more than 5 billion page views a month, co-founder Adam Spector said.\n“Our view is that there should be a personalization API, just like there’s an API for text messages with Twilio or payments with Stripe,” Spector said. “Every digital property should have personalization built in. Media, e-commerce, enterprise, business-to-business SaaS, it doesn’t matter. If you create an experience for users, you should want to give them something they want. The only way to do that at scale is with machine learning.”\nEmphasized by co-founder Indraneel Mukherjee and Spector, “machine learning” part is important because the signals that users give to various websites are going to constantly be changing. As more and more users feed more and more data to the internet, having a truly engaging and personalized experience is table stakes to keep someone’s attention. A lot of companies will claim to be AI companies, but Spector says LiftIgniter has its own flavor that looks at a ton of signals that help define a profile of a user. Each signal is dependent on the last, and it’s the sum of those signals — all closely intertwined — that determines the user’s experience.\n“Our customers’ websites are living and breathing things, and the connections between every piece of content is changing,” Spector said. “The articles you write today could be super relevant to an article that’s five years old. The relevance may change over time. The world is constantly in flux, the idea of having a hard-coded, static list of connections doesn’t make sense.”\nA product like LiftIgniter certainly makes sense: you probably won’t be able to manually update your site fast enough to suit your specific visitors’ needs — especially for each individual user. But the sum of all those individual users is what will drive business, whether that’s through advertising views or purchases. Instead of manually curating a site or a shopping experience and hoping for the best, LiftIgniter tries to convince companies that it can do it at a technical level and drive results immediately.\nAnd that’s one of the core elements of the company. LiftIgniter aims to ensure that the companies are able to get some meaningful metrics of success within 30 days of deploying it. That’s key for many companies, which are looking for some kind of return on any services they employ but may not necessarily get them right away. If you’re going to A/B test and try to personalize your site in order to get users to engage with it more, you’ll want to figure out if the service is actually going to be successful. That means that the companies can, early on, define various objectives and LiftIgniter will try to determine whether it’s able to hit those kinds of targets.\nIt’s going to be a crowded space — with plenty of competition from companies like Google — as companies race to build these kinds of products for companies. They’re going to become mission-critical tools for the rest of the world going forward as Facebook and other services train users to become completely accustomed to very personalized content. LiftIgniter hopes that creating a sort of blanket tool that any site can employ, as well as very quickly demonstrating some success, will give it a competitive edge to survive.\n“We’re literally diverging from ourselves in every moment,” Spector said. “Humans adjust to a changing environment well. Our goals are going to be able to adjust for that and give users what they want. There’s no way I could consume every article. I should find the article I care about with a minimal amount of effort. Without that, they bounce back to Google, or Facebook, and then we outsource their discovery to Facebook and Google.”", "tags": "personalization,liftigniter", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/liftigniter-raises-6-4m-to-bring-website-personalization-to-the-rest-of-the-internet/", "id": "1528216"}, {"title": "CoreOS’s Tectonic container platform gets full support for Microsoft Azure", "text": "CoreOS today announced the general availability of Microsoft Azure support for its Kubernetes-based Tectonic container management platform.

With the ability to do hybrid cloud deployments, infrastructure leaders have the freedom and flexibility of a platform that does not lock users into cloud compute and cloud services.”\n\nOther updates to Tectonic include full support for Kubernetes 1.7, the latest release of the Google-incubated container orchestration service.

Event Grid complements Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft’s existing serverless offerings, and gives developers access to a fully managed event routing service. This new service gives them the flexibility to ingest and react to virtually any event — whether that’s happening inside Azure or on a third-party service or in an existing application.\nDevelopers can use Event Grid to route events to specific endpoints (or even multiple endpoints) and filter them as necessary.\n“Serverless” has always been a misnomer, given that even the most serverless of serverless applications still needs to run on servers. Still, the basic idea behind serverless platforms is that you can use this model to build event-driven applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.Indeed, Microsoft director of Azure Compute Corey Sanders told me that Event Grid actually sits on top of Service Fabric, Microsoft’s platform for building microservices. As a developer, though, you don’t need to worry about managing these services — the platform will handle that for you.\nEvent Grid takes the ideas of Azure Functions and Logic Apps a bit further, though, thanks to its built-in ability to take inputs from any application with the help of webhook endpoints. “The goal here is to offer a first-class event object that customers can manage and manipulate,” Sanders told me. Out of the box, Event Grid also supports Azure Blog Storage, Resource Manager, Application Topics, Event Hubs, Azure Functions, Azure Automation and Logic Apps, with support for other Azure-based services, including the new CosmosDB database service and IoT Hub, coming later this year. Given that IoT applications are a logical fit for this service, it’s actually a bit of a surprise that support for IoT Hub isn’t part of this initial release.\nBeyond standard serverless applications and integrations (something that Logic Apps is already pretty good at), developers can also use Event Grid to automate some of the operations workflows to react to newly spun up virtual machines or databases, for example.\nPricing for Event Grid is based on the number of operations you process. The first 100,00 operations are free; after that, you pay $0.60 per million operations (though during the preview, that price is currently $0.30 per million operations). Operations are defined as any ingress, advanced match, delivery attempt or management call.\n", "tags": "developers,cloud,microsoft-azure", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/microsoft-launches-azure-event-grid-a-fully-managed-event-routing-service/", "id": "1527272"}, {"title": "Snapchat likely to begin scripted original content push by end of year", "text": "Snapchat could start offering original scripted content very soon, according to its content lead Nick Bell (via Variety). Snapchat has already done a lot with creators to build shows, including tie-ins for big broadcast hits like The Voice and The Bachelor, and it’s also working with A&E on reality TV via Second Chance, a dating show featuring exes.\nThis isn’t Snapchat’s first foray into scripted content, either. The social app ran a series called Literally Can’t Even back in 2015, which received generally awful critical reviews, inspiring headlines including “We ‘Literally Can’t Even’ with Snapchat’s new original series” and “Snapchat’s First Original Series is Here and It’s Awful.”\nThis new effort sounds like a rethinking of its approach, featuring “some” content by the end of 2018 according to Variety. Original scripted programming carries with it significant cost, which could be one reason why it has avoided it to date, but Snapchat seems fairly bullish on the idea of becoming a broad-ranging video consumption platform for younger audiences.\nSnapchat isn’t the only tech company looking at producing originals to drive interest among video viewers, however; Apple is reportedly investing $1 billion in original content efforts next year, and Facebook’s Watch tab debuted earlier this month.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/snapchat-likely-to-begin-scripted-original-content-push-by-end-of-year/", "id": "1530377"}, {"title": "LinkedIn opens video uploads to all as part of a bigger video push", "text": "Video is the name of the game in social networking: sites like Facebook and Twitter have been doubling down on the medium in recent years to drive more traffic and engagement from users, and also as a platform to snare more premium advertising away from traditional television broadcasters; Snapchat put video at the core of its service from Day One.\nNow Microsoft-owned LinkedIn is hoping to muscle in on the party with its own video strategy. Today the social networking site for the working world is launching a new feature to let any user upload a video to the site, via LinkedIn’s iOS or Android mobile app.\nThe idea will be to let users create videos that highlight their professional work: projects that have been finished or are in progress; product demonstrations; and other work-related videos that highlight what you do. It looks and feels very much like a video launch for the non-Snapchat set. For those who might not know where to start but think it might be a good idea to upload some video, LinkedIn has taken the very un-Snapchatty route of providing some direction and pointers.\nThe feature getting announced today isn’t entirely new: the company started a limited release of it earlier this year. Early evidence seems to point to video doing just what LinkedIn hoped it would: so far, videos from the limited release are already getting shared 20 times more than any other content. Before that, there were other dabbles in video: last year, LinkedIn launched a Quora-style Q&A service with influencers on the site that marked its first foray into moving pictures.\nLaunching user-generated video is a long time coming, but for the 500 million of us who use LinkedIn, being late isn’t too much of a surprise.\nLinkedIn hasn’t been known as the fastest moving of social networks over the years. Run a short Google search on the words “LinkedIn” and “finally” on TC or across the wider web and you can see the story of how it was late(r) to the party on mobile (Android, iPad and later giving more parity to the mobile and web experiences), on other advanced features for users to communicate and share news, on targeting the developing world and more.\n“We have been focused on expanding the ways members can create and share professional content,” a spokesperson told me in response to my questions about why it has taken so long to launch a video product. “As we did with the ability to publish, we wanted to take a thoughtful approach to introduce video creation to the LinkedIn platform in a way that it adds to the consumption experience, and fits seamlessly with how our members post, share and discover.”\nBut now that the ball has gotten rolling, what is interesting to me is to consider how LinkedIn might evolve the product, and just how it could fit into what it has built and wants to develop in the future.\n\nKey to that is launching live video.\nEarlier this year, LinkedIn quietly hired a product manager from Facebook Live called Peter Roybal, who is heading up the video service. Roybal reports to Pete Davies, who joined LinkedIn when the company last year quietly acquired his startup Run Hop, and now oversees all of LinkedIn’s content and publishing. The fact that Roybal had been involved with FB Live — the mammoth social network’s own live broadcasting platform — is a strong sign of where LinkedIn hopes to take its own video offering.\nLive video is an obvious and natural complement to what LinkedIn has already been developing on its platform in areas like education, company profile pages, recruitment and professional networking.\nIn education, after buying Lynda.com for $1.5 billion, LinkedIn has created a site called LinkedIn Learning, which offers online courses both for individuals and companies training their employees. It’s also been piloting a mentoring program this summer.\nAll of these are areas where you could imagine live video components, either providing a one-to-many broadcasting feature with text-based interactions from viewers or one-to-one video chats.\nOne-to-one video chats are also a no-brainer when you consider LinkedIn’s recruitment business, which has for years made up the majority of its revenues: video can be used both to help advertise businesses and open positions, as well as a tool for interviewing candidates.\n(Sidenote: one area that we haven’t seen any activity at all is any link up between LinkedIn and Skype, another Microsoft business. But we’ve heard that Skype is also building a platform for interviews. Microsoft declined to comment when we asked about it, but it’s already a popular use for Skype and so it would make sense to formalize that.)\n“Live video and live video chat is an interesting possibility down the road because it helps people add a whole different dimension,” the LinkedIn spokesperson said.\nOther areas where LinkedIn is very likely to bring video in the near future is advertising and videos from companies on the service.\nCompany videos are “coming soon,” the spokesperson tells me, and a separate source notes that these videos will be hosted both on company pages as well as in other places: another feature that LinkedIn has been quietly developing has been event-style pages that let you search for specific subjects by hashtags in order to browse videos and other content related to them (here is one for #TED2017). These pages will give users one more ways to discover that video content.\nMuch of this, longer term, is likely to help feed into one of the biggest reasons for getting deeper into video in the first place: advertising.\nAs Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, Yahoo/AOL/Oath and others have found, video is where the money is for digital advertising today, so bringing more content around the medium overall would help LinkedIn move into video advertising more naturally, as well.\n“We don’t currently serve video ads at this time. We’re focused on building a great experience and learning from our members. But this is a natural progression and something we are evaluating for the future,” the company tells me. “There aren’t plans today, but there are a lot of interesting features that we’re going to look at.”\nA moving target for sure, but one that LinkedIn (and Microsoft) are now very focused on hitting.", "tags": "video", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/linkedin-video/", "id": "1529721"}, {"title": "Teens favoring Snapchat and Instagram over Facebook, says eMarketer", "text": "Facebook is losing appeal among teens and young adults which is contributing to generally slowing growth for the platform, according to the latest projections from research firm eMarketer.\nAt the same time alternative social apps Snapchat and (Facebook-owned) Instagram are seeing rising and double-digit growth in the same youth demographic — suggesting younger users are favoring newer and more visual communications platforms.\n“Both platforms have found success with this demographic since they are more aligned with how they communicate — using visual content,” noted eMarketer forecasting analyst Oscar Orozco in a statement.\nIt’s the second consecutive year of expected usage declines for Facebook among this advertiser-coveted group, according to the researcher.\neMarketer suggests some tweens are even skipping adopting Facebook entirely (it calls them “Facebook nevers”) and going straight to the rival platforms, even as remaining tweens and teens appear less engaged on Facebook — logging in less frequently and spending less time on the platform.\nWhile having slipping relevance among a coveted ad demographic is obviously not good news for a social behemoth whose business is dependent on ad revenue, Facebook does have the consolation of also owning one of the two main youth-friendly alternative platforms: Instagram. (Aka, ‘if you can’t be it, buy it’.)\nStill, eMarketer is also projecting that the acquisition that got away from Zuck, Snapchat, will overtake Instagram and Facebook in the total teen (12 to 17) & young adult (18 to 24) ages for the first time in 2017 — boosting its share of US social network users to 40.8 per cent, and projected to push close to a majority by 2021.

Now that new experience is rolling out to desktop users, but in a more limited fashion, Microsoft announced this morning.\nThe new desktop app introduces an updated user interface that’s meant to give Skype a more youthful feel. Group chats are multi-colored. Bright, squiggly lines are used to indicate when contacts are typing or to separate out unread messages, among other things. Chats are given more prominent billing. Emojis can be used to ‘react’ to what others are saying while in video calls or in text conversations.\nThese changes, when Skype’s update arrived on mobile, were too radical for many users. The app suffered from poor reviews on the App Store and Google Play, with many accusing the company of having Snapchat envy.\n\nBut there are some additions that will be useful in the new Skype desktop, despite all this social app envy. For example, a new media gallery can be viewed on the right side of a group chat, which makes it easier to locate shared files, like documents, spreadsheets, photos or other media, that had been posted into the group.\nHowever, this gallery is a bit too jazzy…when it’s empty, it has a busy, squiggly line-filled background that seems entirely unnecessary.\nGroup calling has gotten a makeover too, with support for real-time screen and photo sharing, and of course, emoji reactions that pop up as a temporary overlay on the screen. (Which you probably should not use during work calls, okay?)\nSkype is also adding support for @mentions – something that’s become a convention in social and communication apps, whether work-related or not. Most major apps today – like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Slack, etc. – support this functionality, so it makes sense to bring it to Skype, too.\nWhen you first launch the new app, you can pick between a light or dark theme – the latter which has become a popular choice for social apps as of late, with dark themes appearing on services like YouTube and Twitter.\nWhen you want to start a chat, group or call, you now do so from a plus button on the top left. Here, you can also find Skype’s list of available bots, like those for travel, work, entertainment and gaming.\nOne more prominent feature that was a key part of Skype’s mobile makeover, however, is missing: Highlights.\nThis was Skype’s Snapchat-like take on Stories. The idea is that users would snap a photo or video, decorate it with text and stickers, then share it by posting to Highlights, where your followers can view it at any time.\nBut don’t get too excited if you were hoping to avoid the Stories takeover of social media.

Do we open our squares to men who will fight equality? Do we unlock our school grounds so that fear can reign? Do we simply close our windows on loudspeakers calling out for genocide or do we act? I don’t have an answer, but sunlight has always been the best antiseptic and seeing most of these groups on a bare parade ground lays bare their insignificance.\nBut what do you about the Internet where everything is shadow hiding inside corporate iron? The Internet is a utility, to a degree, but not one whose sanctity is guaranteed to us by some holy writ. We send bits over corporate networks onto servers housed in corporate basements. We shout into corporate megaphones and write screeds – like this one – into corporate editor windows.\nOn that skein of wires there is no sunlight. We, the creators of that world, must decide.

I still agree that DRM is wrong, that media wants to be free and that good media will be paid for by someone. I still agree that sex is far less egregious than violence and that visions of both help define the lines of our personalities and ensure we do not wander too far into some puritan desert. I was angry, for example, when Pinterest pulled sexual content but know I know things have changed. Pinterest runs is own servers. It is responsible for the contents. It deserves final say.\nAnd that’s where we are now.

And who wants to live in a world where /r/aww lives next to /r/poli?\nWe, the curators of the Internet, have to decide. Some of us already have. We see Cloudflare and GoDaddy pulling their services from white power site Daily Stormer. Cloudflare’s CEO Matthew Prince agonized over the decision. He, like most Internet users, expects the web to be free as in freedom.\n“Our team has been thorough and have had thoughtful discussions for years about what the right policy was on censoring. Like a lot of people, we’ve felt angry at these hateful people for a long time but we have followed the law and remained content neutral as a network. We could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare,” he wrote. “You, like me, may believe that the Daily Stormer’s site is vile. You may believe it should be restricted. You may think the authors of the site should be prosecuted. Reasonable people can and do believe all those things. But having the mechanism of content control be vigilante hackers launching DDoS attacks subverts any rational concept of justice.”\nIn the end this is where we must go. It’s folks like Rabbi Abe Cooper as well as Valley CEOs who will help us find a way forward. Freedom of speech in the public square is one right we all have.

By taking advantage of developments in AI and video camera technology, the company offers a solution for amateur soccer clubs that want to video and stream matches and training sessions without the need for a camera operator or vision mixer/editor.\nThe Veo camera mount consists of two 4K cameras encased within a 3D-printed box, designed to be positioned on a four-metre tripod just outside of the pitch’s halfway line. The cameras then record a 180-degree panoramic view of the full pitch, with the resulting image stitched together and the AI-tech working hard to follow the action via virtual panning and zooming on the resulting recording video file.\nThat, of course, means that a portion of the image will often be cropped out, resulting in a loss of resolution overall. However, the idea is that by starting with 4K the resulting video quality is more than sufficient, not least for playback on smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets.\n“Today, less than 1 per cent of all football matches are recorded,” says Veo co-founder and CEO Henrik Teisbæk. “This is because in order to record a football match properly, you need a cameraman to be filming from an elevated position for 90 mins, and then be able to edit the footage afterwards. Most teams simply don’t have the resources required for this, meaning that millions of goals and unique footballing moments are never viewed or shared by the players”.\n\nTo get around this, Teisbæk says Veo’s AI technology can detect where the action is on the field, and automatically zoom and pan to follow the ball – just like a camera operator would do. “We have spent nearly two years developing the technology to detect where on the pitch a camera operator would point and zoom,” he explains.\n“Using deep neural networks and computer vision, our tech can now track the ball and players with consistency and precision. This is combined with advanced video editing techniques, so we can zoom and pan inside the full panoramic video and ‘crop’ out the relevant part”.\nDespite the aforementioned loss of quality, the advantage of this approach is that the Veo cameras can record from a static position, and don’t need to pan and tilt during the recording. It also means coaches and players can manually create their own edits after the match, by choosing the virtual camera angle and where to zoom.\n“Since the zooming is done digitally, the output pixel quality is reduced. However it’s important to stress that the recordings are not meant for professional TV broadcasting and that the reduced video quality format works really well on devices with smaller screens,” reiterates Teisbæk.\nThe startup’s business model is based on subscription fees from football clubs. The entry camera subscription will starts from £999 annually. Clubs can upgrade to embed their local sponsors’ logos onto the match videos and highlights, which could also provide those clubs with a welcome additional revenue stream.\nMeanwhile, I’m told Veo has raised a total of €2 million in seed funding to date, with Copenhagen-based Seed Capital most recently investing €1.1 million in April 2017. The remaining €900,000 came via angel investors including: David Fellah (Founder of Designit); Per Zachariassen (Founder of Blu and Skylark); Henrik Hancke (Founder of Blu and Skylark); and Kasper Wedendahl (Founder of Bacon).", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/veo/", "id": "1532848"}, {"title": "Europe’s VR landscape continues to grow rapidly despite market slowdown", "text": "\n\nLast November I covered how Europe’s VR meetup community has more than doubled in its member base of freelancers, startups and companies. The booming region has given rise to the likes of EUVR, a nonprofit organization dedicated to maturing the VR industry in Europe by offering platforms and resources to help address issues like its increasingly fragmented ecosystem. Its first platform to debut in April was an interactive database that offers the kind of visibility that is often sorely lacking in an emerging tech space. A leading Japanese mobile game studio, Gumi, is supporting the EUVR with investment and resources that translates into a healthy vote of confidence on the value-add that the database offers the region’s rapidly growing VR community.\n“Europe has the potential to become a leading region in VR content: Our creativity, our cultural heritage and our talents are all assets that can be used to create unforgettable VR experiences, amazing video games and disruptive B2B applications.

Its translation tool is just as quick as the outsized competition, but more accurate and nuanced than any we’ve tried.\nI only speak a smattering of French in addition to my passable English, but luckily my colleague Frederic is a man of many tongues. We both agreed that DeepL’s translations were generally superior to those from Google Translate and Bing.\nTake, for example, the following passage from a German news article, as rendered by DeepL (top) and Google:\n \nAs Frederic puts it: “Whereas Google Translate often goes for a very literal translation that misses some nuances and idioms (or gets the translation of these idioms dead wrong), DeepL often provides a more natural translation that comes closer to that of a trained translator.”\nThe second sentence is parsed more naturally; the measure is “designed to” accomplish something rather than just doing that thing; the police are “on the road in armoured vehicles” as opposed to merely on them; “martial appearance” may be imperfect (though inspired) but it’s far better than the nonsensical “fighters’ turmoil…had come to the fore.”\nA few tests of my own on some French literature I know well enough to judge had DeepL coming out on top regularly, as well. Fewer errors of tense, intent and agreement, plus a better understanding and deployment of idiom make for a much more readable translation. We thought so, and so did translators in DeepL’s own blind testing. But don’t take anyone else’s word for it — test it out yourself.\nWhile it’s true that meaning can be conveyed successfully despite errors of that class, as evidenced by the utility we’ve all found in even the poorest machine translations, it’s far from guaranteed that anything but the barest facts of will make it through.\nDeepL was born from the similarly excellent Linguee, a translation tool that has existed for years and, while popular, never quite reached the level of Google Translate — the latter has a huge advantage in brand and position, after all. Linguee’s co-founder, Gereon Frahling, used to work for Google Research but left in 2007 to pursue this new venture.\nThe team has been working with machine learning for years, for tasks adjacent to the core translation, but it was only last year that they began working in earnest on a whole new system and company, both of which would bear the name DeepL.\nIn an email, Frahling told me that the time was ripe: “We have built a neural translation network that incorporates most of the latest developments, to which we added our own ideas.”\nAn enormous database of over a billion translations and queries, plus a method of ground-truthing translations by searching for similar snippets on the web, made for a strong base in the training of the new model. They also put together what they claim is the 23rd most powerful supercomputer in the world, conveniently located in Iceland.\nDevelopments published by universities, research agencies and indeed Linguee’s competitors showed that convolutional neural networks were the way to go, rather than the recurrent neural networks the company had been using previously. Now isn’t really the place to go into the differences between CNNs and RNNs, so it must suffice to say that for accurate translation of long, complex strings of related words, the former is a better bet as long as you can control for its weaknesses.\nFor example, a CNN could roughly be able to be said to tackle one word of the sentence at a time. This becomes a problem when, for instance, as commonly happens, a word at the end of the sentence determines how a word at the beginning of the sentence should be formed. It’s wasteful to go through the whole sentence only to find that the first word the network picked is wrong, and then start over with that knowledge, so DeepL and others in the machine learning field apply “attention mechanisms” that monitor for such potential trip-ups and resolve them before the CNN moves on to the next word or phrase.\nThere are other secret techniques in play, of course, and their result is a translation tool that I personally plan to make my new default. I look forward to seeing the others step up their game.", "tags": "deepl,machine-learning,translation", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/deepl-schools-other-online-translators-with-clever-machine-learning/", "id": "1533081"}, {"title": "Meltwater acquires Algo, an AI-based news and data tracker", "text": "", "tags": "ai,media-monitoring,meltwater", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/meltwater-acquires-algo-an-ai-based-news-and-data-tracker/", "id": "1532968"}, {"title": "Jaguar Land Rover is backing DOVU to bring the Blockchain to the mobile future", "text": "The Blockchain was created as an open-source, free, decentralized accounting system where transactions are recorded across multiple computers. Its first use was for tracking the first genuine crypto-currency, Bitcoin, but it could be could be adapted to track anything, including, for instance, electrons. So, for instance, if you can automatically record the flow of electricity units between charging stations and cars, you can support the growing infrastructure of charging stations.\nAnother is that to make autonomous driving truly viable, you will need an open platform to hand over data between you, the car, the vehicle owner (less and less likely to be you), infrastructure providers, insurers, you name it. The Blockchain could be perfect for this. Thus, now startups are appearing which plan to leverage these ideas.\nA new UK startups intends to do just that. DOVU aims to become “the global marketplace for transport data.” It’s planning a token sale on 3 Oct, 2017, which will fund its distributed marketplace for the “give and take of transport-related APIs”, powered by the “DOV” token.\nNow, while there as many token sales, and many other startups in mobility right now, what sets DOVU apart is that it is well-connected in the transport sector. In April 2017, DOVU received seed funding from InMotion Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover’s investment arm, and Creative England, a fund backed by the UK Government.\nFounder and CEO Irfon Watkins is a serial entrepreneur who has founded and sold companies across the API spectrum, including the large-scale ad-platform Coull. His advisory board includes Lars Klawitter, General Manager of Rolls Royce Bespoke, who is also a director of the Ethereum Foundation, no less. DOVU also includes co-founder and CMO Arwen Smit, and co-founder and COO Krasina Mileva.\nRight now transport data is locked up on multiple platforms. By using blockchain technology, DOVU aims to provide trust for corporates or individuals by opening up the availability of all these data sets for public and enterprise use. The DOVU system works by creating a distributed marketplace for transport data. That would mean vehicle hire, insurance companies, ride-sharing and others could be connected to create a network of transport-related data resources. This shared data becomes more valuable because it’s shared, not because it’s locked into one platform. That could spell an interesting question for companies like Uber. Imagine if you created a sort of ‘federated Uber”?\nWatkins says: “The transport sector knows where it wants to go with real-time data and smart technology but doesn’t know how to get there! DOVU is the missing piece of the puzzle – an on-ramp for fast, secure and global data sharing for everybody.”\nWith DOVU you could, for example, combine car data with insurance data to calculate smarter policies, or use geolocation data in conjunction with weather statistics to inform ride-hailing companies.\nSimilar to using an in-game currency, contributors could be rewarded with tokens based on the quality of their input.\nThat implies things like having a Smartphone app which not only unlocks a shared vehicle, and automatically signs you in to the DOVU platform, but would allow you to sell or share the car’s data while driving.\nIt could even allow to track your movements (walking, running, cycling, driving) and then let you sell this data in return for DOV Tokens that can be used to buy petrol, train journeys or bus rides. Get walking, to fund your car habit…\nAs you can see it’s a brave new mobility world out there.\n", "tags": "jaguar-land-rover", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/jaguar-land-rover-is-backing-dovu-to-bring-the-blockchain-to-the-mobile-future/", "id": "1533038"}, {"title": "Sherpa secures $2.3M to build AI-driven insurance platform tailored to individuals", "text": "Price comparison websites for insurance products have been around for many years.

While other companies, including Amazon, have tested drone deliveries, Flytrex says this is the first time a fully operational on-demand drone delivery service has launched in an urban area. Drones will take orders from online marketplace AHA’s headquarters in Reykjavik to a destination two miles away during the project’s first phase.\nHeadquartered in Tel Aviv, Flytrex raised a $3 million Series A earlier this year for its drone technology. Its drones were approved by the Icelandic Transport Authority to pick up orders from restaurants and stores on one side of Reykjavik and fly them to a designated drop-off point in the suburb of Grafarvogur.\nFlytrex CEO and co-founder Yariv Bash says Reykjavik is a good place to test the efficiency of drone deliveries because parts of the city are separated by a bay. Drivers often need to navigate around the shoreline, but drones can just fly over the water. Deliveries that would usually take 25 minutes by car in Reykjavik can be completed by a Flytrex drone in only four minutes, the company claims. Not only are deliveries faster, but they can also more cost-efficient. Bash says AHA has already seen a 60 percent in cost per delivery by using drones.\nDrones can handle packages that weigh up to 3 kg and are a bit larger than a shoebox, so deliveries are currently best suited for smaller orders or restaurant food. During the first part of the Reykjavik program, Flytrex will fly one drone that will make 20 deliveries per day for AHA, before adding more over the next few weeks. Its goal is to make hundreds of deliveries per day directly to customers’ yards within a few months.\nBackyard deliveries are possible in Reykjavik because much of the city is suburban. Flytrex’s drones use smart mapping to adapt to other environments and operate at about 50 meters in the air, which means they can clear most obstacles. Bash says Flytrex is already working on a project in an area with many high-rise buildings and is currently seeking approval from regulators in European, South American and Central American countries.\n“In high-rise environments like Manhattan, the most likely scenario is to have drones deliver packages at the entrance to buildings or on rooftops, which our system is already capable of doing technologically speaking,” he says. “We believe that regulators approving city-wide drone delivery in high-rise urban environments is just around the corner.”", "tags": "iceland,drone,flytrex", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/flytrex-launches-an-autonomous-on-demand-drone-delivery-service-in-icelands-capital/", "id": "1530871"}, {"title": "Google Maps suggests BlaBlaCar for long-distance rides", "text": "Google Maps on Android and iOS now has a new transportation option.

However, in a call, co-founder and CEO Thilo Konzok said that the vision is much bigger: to provide the best housing experiences for tenants and landlords alike.\nThat mission perhaps hints to Konzok and Home’s other co-founder Moritz von Hase’s background both as a landlord and in architecture.

The company, then called Splittable, offered a way to manage and share household expenses with multiple house members. However, the bigger vision was to build a platform for ‘Generation Rent’ that makes moving from one houseshare to another as easy as logging in and out of the Acasa app. A spew of recent updates (including the name change itself) are seeing that vision begin to come into focus.\nWithin the Acasa web and mobile apps, household members in the U.K. can set up, manage and split costs for their energy, broadband, water and TV license provision, whilst I’m told Council Tax will be added soon. To achieve this, the startup has partnered with a number of ‘challenger services,’ including broadband company Origin, and green energy provider Octopus Energy. It’s also penned a partnership with Virgin Media to offer the telco’s broadband services directly in the Acasa app.\n“Running a home sucks, it’s still analogue, archaic, and arduous,” Acasa co-founder and CEO Nicholas Katz tells me. “One person always gets screwed over by having to be the one in charge of bills/finances (which also means they take on all the credit risk which most renters don’t realise!). Eight days of every year of your life are wasted dealing with home finances, setting up bills, talking to providers, chasing people you live with for money”.\nThat pain-point was one Katz says he’s experienced directly as a bonafide member of Generation Rent. He claims to have rented 17 homes and lived with over 50 housemates in 4 different countries (U.S., U.K., Israel, Germany). “I’m an “expert” at dealing with housemate and shared housing issues,” he jokes.\nTo get started with the Acasa app you register a user profile and then choose from the types of services you want to set up. Currently this includes energy, Internet, TV license, water, with more coming soon. After adding some basic information about your home (ie how many people you live with, number of rooms, etc.), Acasa will provide a quote for all of these services.\nAfter a home is set up, a digital “magnet” for each supplier appears on the Acasa dashboard, which you click on to adjust how the cost is split between the people in your home or to learn more about the supplier.\nThen when the bill is due, the magnet on the home will adjust automatically to represent how much each of you owe to the service provider, and each person is automatically charged the agreed portion of the bill and the money is collected by Acasa and sent to the supplier in one lump sum.\n“The magnet sets back to zero and it’s happy living until the next month’s bill is due,” explains Katz.\nThe ultimate goal, however, is to make setting up a new home a one-click affair, with all of your required services automatically signed up to and trackable. A “technology layer for the home,” is how Katz describes it, something akin to the way co-working space provider WeWork has built what it calls a co-working Operating System. A convenience layer might also be an apt description.\nThe other aspect to Acasa as a platform is that you only need to make a user profile once, meaning that your Acasa credentials move house with you, either so you can be added to an existing Acasa-powered houseshare or create a new household of your own. That not only helps to make the app sticky but is a potential viral loop, too.\nMeanwhile, since launching in 2015, the company has grown to a team of 9, with over 150,000 app downloads and on average tracks £5 million in home costs every month. In addition, I’m told that Acasa’s peer-to-peer money transfer service, which is only available to users in the U.K., despite the app being global, now averages £50,000 a month.\nThe startup is publicly backed to the tune of $1.2 million from VCs Seedcamp, Playfair Capital, the London Co-Investment Fund and a number of angel investors, but I understand has since closed a further follow-on investment round for an undisclosed amount. I’m also hearing that Acasa is currently raising additional funding, most likely a fully-fledged Series A.\n“I love the idea of leveraging technology to help people live better at home. It’s amazing to feel and hear how we are genuinely helping people improve their relationships with the people they live with as well as the suppliers they usually have an absolutely fucking miserable time with — think back to the last joyful moment you had talking to one of your utility companies,” adds the Acasa CEO.", "tags": "splittable,acasa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/acasa/", "id": "1529025"}, {"title": "Online hate crime to be treated the same as face-to-face crime in the UK", "text": "Sometimes the most obvious solutions might be the best.

And, for once, this doesn’t involve the government hurling abuse at the social platforms themselves.\nThe innovation, if you want to think of it in that way, is mainly to do with the U.K.’s interpretation of free speech. In the U.S., the first amendment allows you to say basically anything, as long as it’s not immediately dangerous or directly threatening to someone. That means you can burn a cross or two, or walk around shouting racist slogans, so long as no one gets hurt at the time. Paradoxically, no connection is made between that and any real-world consequences, and the law has never been updated for the rapid spread of these ideas through radio, TV or the internet.\nIn the U.K. that just doesn’t wash. So, for instance, there’s a law against “incitement to racial hatred,” which is a criminal offense. The new CPS rules mean that the law now applies to anything said online, as well as offline. There also is a law against “incitement to religious hatred,” in case you were wondering.\nWriting in the Guardian, Saunders said: “Left unchallenged, even low-level offending can subsequently fuel the kind of dangerous hostility that has been plastered across our media in recent days.” That is why countering it is a priority for the CPS. “Whether shouted in their face on the street, daubed on a wall or tweeted into their living room, hateful abuse can have a devastating impact on victims.”\nShe referred specifically to the extremist hate seen in Charlottesville in the United States recently, saying the new rules were needed because there is a direct correlation between online abuse and violence.\nSaunders said the new plans were based on the growing need to protect those online from crimes such as abuse, as people spend an increasing proportion of their lives on the internet. In addition, there is a realization that abuse in the virtual world has real-world consequences, with the spreading of fear online resulting in acts of physical violence.\nIn a world of grotesque physical attacks that may appear a heavy-handed approach to some. But perhaps we should ask the question, what is it that the perpetrators seek to achieve? One common thread that links online purveyors of hate with those who commit physical hate crimes or real-world terrorists is “the desire to undermine and instil fear in those they target,” both individually and collectively in their communities, because of their characteristics, be that “race, religion, gender, sexuality and even disability,” she wrote.\nThe CPS intends for the new guidance to generate more prosecutions, with longer sentences for those convicted, thus leading to some level of prevention.\nThe new guidance covers hate crime pertaining to race, religion, disability and crimes that are homophobic, biphobic and transphobic.\nGovernment figures have shown a 20 percent rise in hate crimes reported to the U.K. police in the first quarter this year, and these figures are considered to be highly under-reported.\nThe U.K. is perhaps heading in the direction of Germany.\nPublic displays of Nazi and Communist symbols are banned in Germany, and Holocaust denial is punishable by up to five years in prison. Inciting hatred or violence against anyone for their ethnic or religious identity is also a crime.\nIn July, German government officials ordered the police to carry out a nationwide crackdown on racist or xenophobic social postings. They raided the homes of 36 people suspected of being behind the posts, but no arrests were made.\nGermany also has approved a new bill that punishes social networking sites if they fail to swiftly remove illegal content such as hate speech or defamatory fake news. If infracted, the laws impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($53.4 million) on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.\nGermany’s latest solution is much more heavy-handed on tech platforms, when it seems smarter to simply remind people to be respectful of each other’s views and ask them to debate in a civilized manner. And if they can’t do that, then they can go to jail. Or perhaps that’s too much to ask these days?", "tags": "hate-crime", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/online-hate-crime-to-be-treated-the-same-as-face-to-face-crime-in-the-uk/", "id": "1529309"}, {"title": "Soundcharts is an analytics tools for music artists and labels", "text": "French startup Soundcharts is building a sort of App Annie for music artists.

The company just raised $3.1 million  (€2.65M) from Alven Capital, as well as Kima Ventures and Global Founders Capital.\nMany big music labels already work with companies to get insights about radio airplay. They pay a ton of money to Nielsen to access this data for instance.\nSoundcharts wants to level the playing field and add more data. Many people don’t tune into the radio to find new music. They subscribe to popular playlists on Spotify, they follow artists on Facebook and more. If you want to stay ahead of the game, airtime is not enough, at least not anymore.\n“We want to be the Bloomberg Finance of music,” founder and CEO David Weiszfeld told me. “Or like what App Annie is doing for apps.”\nSoundcharts has servers around the world listening to hundreds of radios at the same time. These servers are using music recognition technology like Shazam to turn an audio signal into structured data.\nThis way, you can browse by country, by station, by artist or by song and see who is playing what. You can compare your artists with your competitors, you can find out what’s popular and more. It’s also a good tool for festival programmers.\nSoundcharts is also using Spotify’s API to index all public playlists and track changes. This way, when a Chvrches song is added to an official Spotify playlist, you can see it in Soundcharts. And if you’re looking for common trends, the service also tracks playlist growth. You’ll be the first to know if dubstep is making a comeback.\nFinally, Soundcharts tracks Facebook likes, gives you a breakdown by country and tells you about growth. There are many social media analytics services out there, but it’s a nice way to make Soundcharts a one stop shop. Everybody can access all data, so it’s not limited to your own artists.\nSo far, 250 companies have signed up, including employees working for Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music, as well as independent labels, publishers and management companies.

That’s seeing a number of challenger banks skating to where the puck is going, including London-based Starling Bank, which today is launching the Starling Marketplace.\nBilled by the digital-only challenger bank as a new concept in banking, the Starling Marketplace puts products from other fintech providers (and in the future “lifestyle products,” because nearly every business is going to be tempted to jump onboard the Open Banking train) within “an easily browsed ecosystem” accessible within the Starling app.\nPartnering companies integrate with Starling Bank via the challenger bank’s Open Banking-compliant APIs, although, as I’ll explain below, are integrating more deeply than simply making use of those APIs, which any third-party developer, once vetted, can potentially do.\nThe first fintech company to be added to the Starling Marketplace, and an example of the deepest kind of integration we are likely to see, is Flux, the itemised receipt and rewards startup based in London. Founded by Tom Reay, Matty Cusden-Ross, and Veronique Barbosa, all former early employees at Revolut, the company has built a software platform that bridges the gap between the itemised receipt data captured by a merchant’s point-of-sale (POS) system and what little information typically shows up on your bank statement or mobile banking app.\nThe Starling integration sees Flux send real-time itemised receipts to the Starling app when a customer pays with their Starling card at any of Flux’s retail partners, which so far includes all 111 EAT stores in the U.K. and Bel-Air. As early as next week, Flux will also enable Starling users to get automated loyalty points with cash-back for Flux-supported purchases, without the need for paper coupons. Starling Bank users will need to activate Flux from the Marketplace section of the Starling app to instantly link their card.\n“This is our first native integration, where you can switch on Flux from in app, and our first full bank partnership,” Flux’s Cusden-Ross tells TechCrunch. “Starling customers should switch on Flux because we’ll help them finally rid their wallets of paper receipts and paper loyalty cards without asking them to download or setup anything extra. We also think Starling customers are particularly interested in tracking their financial life in real-time and would agree it’s insane that today the only way to keep track of exactly what we buy is via little bits of paper”.\nThe framing of Starling’s Flux integration as a “first full bank partnership” refers to the fact that Flux originally launched with rival challenger bank Monzo, but only in a very limited pilot that restricts the number of users that can be activated as Monzo readies its own API and marketplace banking offer.\n“The users we do have have been really positive on the experience and have been driving our word of mouth sign-ups to sky-rocket, they’re all patiently on a waitlist and we’re working with Monzo to understand timelines for next steps. The on-boarding experience for Monzo is also a pilot version where the user is currently on-boarding through our website and not natively in Monzo,” explains Cusden-Ross.\nIn a call with Megan Caywood, Chief Platform Officer at Starling Bank, she explained that the Flux partnership, when/if Starling users choose to activate the functionality, enables a greater detail of spending data to be displayed within the Starling app for purchases made at merchants that support Flux. By default, Starling users can see the retailer’s name, amount spent, date and location (complete with a map), but Flux goes further by displaying the item bought, VAT and any available loyalty stamps.\nZooming out a bit further, Caywood says that Starling third-party integrations fall into three categories. Flux and the bank’s upcoming partnership with TransferWise are examples of the deepest type of Starling app integration but isn’t typical.\nInstead, whilst they’ll be discoverable and can be authorised via something akin to an app store within the Starling app, most Marketplace apps will only send back and display a limited amount of data in the form of a dashboard or ‘widget’ (my words, not Caywood’s). If I understand correctly, in certain instances this trade-off reduces the regulatory burden on Starling and, crucially, is a good compromise to stop the Starling app from becoming bloated.\nA third category of integration are apps that simply make use of Starling’s API. Right now, these include Tail, the local offers startup I recently covered, or roundups app Moneybox, which use the API to authenticate, access and build on top of various levels of your Starling bank account data and functionality, with your permission, of course.\n“TransferWise will be one end of the spectrum, being deeply integrated, whereas Moneybox is at the other end of the spectrum where they just integrate our API but don’t appear in Starling,” Caywood tells me. “The Marketplace portion of the app is a hybrid – where an app has integrated our API and we have integrated theirs, so users can find them and connect to them via the Starling app, and have a dashboard in Starling that gives an overview”.\nMeanwhile, I’m hearing that Flux has closed $1.5 million in seed funding led by PROfounders. I also understand that Anthemis, which has invested in other fintech companies such as Currency Cloud and Azimo, participated in the round.", "tags": "starling-bank,flux", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/starling-bank-marketplace/", "id": "1538647"}, {"title": "As global startup exits grow, Europe sees its profile rise", "text": "\n\nLooking at the number of exits produced and the total dollar volume those liquidity events commanded, the European startup scene has shown growth over the past year.\nThat fact comes from the Startups M&A 2017 Report — made in partnership with Crunchbase and Mind the Bridge. The report details the growth and maturation of the global startup scene, with a particular focus on the European continent and its most recent exit results.\nThis is the second time Crunchbase and Mind the Bridge have worked together to dive into the world of European startups. Last year the data, as noted on TechCrunch at the time, indicated that in the last half decade “U.S. companies have purchased about four times as many startups as European acquirers.”\nSo how much has changed since the last report?\nThe number of global startup exits from 2011 to 2017 has shown rapid growth, especially since 2014, a year that could be fairly tagged as one of the peaks in the unicorn cycle. According to the report, the 12-month period ending July, 2017 saw 4,217 startup exits, up from 2,976 in the preceding period.\nHowever, that growth was not mirrored in the value of those exits. Of course, we are dealing with partial exit numbers, as many liquidity events are never price-disclosed. Regardless of that caveat, the following chart was eye-catching:\n\n(Date range: July 2010 to June 2017. From the document: “Annual data refers to the period July (previous)-June (listed).”)\nEven though total deal volume increased, there are three possibilities that spring to mind concerning the deceleration in exit dollar worth of those startups:\nRegardless, the 2017 period as listed above set new records. This implies, with caveats, that the environment is still quite good for startups looking to tap out, trade in or join up.\nWriting from Silicon Valley, it’s easy to forget that other parts of California exist. But in addition to the rest of California, it turns out whole other continents feature startup activity.\nFor instance, it isn’t hard to find enthusiasm about Latin America. And we can even find a little bit too much exuberance in certain sectors of the Chinese startup world. Now let’s narrow the sight on Europe, as the report has several data points concerning the continent that are worth our time.\nFirst, cutting down from the above chart here are the exit numbers, broken down by geographic region:\n\nIn the listed 2016 period, European exits accounted for just 42.5 percent of the U.S. total. In the 2017 period, that number had risen to 52.6 percent. Of course, the raw number of U.S. exits grew dramatically over the same period. So what’s the implication? In short, the European scene, despite growth in the U.S. market, managed to grab more relative exit share.\nThat’s pretty bullish. Now here are the same charts tracking known exit value:\n\nRunning the same numbers, here’s what we can say: In the 2016 period, European startup exits were worth just 30.6 percent of their U.S. counterparts. In the 2017-period, that number grew to 50.9 percent.\nHowever, as the value of U.S. startup exits fell, we could be seeing the specter of undisclosed exit values coming to roost. How likely it is that the aggregate (know and unknown) dollar value was down in the U.S. compared to the year before is up to you to determine.\nRegardless, the value of European startup exits went up as its deal volume rose.\nNotable in the report is cross-border startup M&A between the U.S. and Europe. Given the strong trade ties between the two areas, it’s perhaps not surprising that there is quite a lot of cross-Atlantic startup deal making.\nHere are three key data points:\nSumming the three, both the U.S. and Europe largely conduct M&A deals inside their own borders, which isn’t shocking. Geographical proximity counts for a lot, even in our digital age, given the wildly varying local laws concerning IP, taxes and more. But that fact doesn’t stop the continents from buying from each other. In fact, of the companies that European startups buy, a quarter were from the U.S. They were purchased at high cost, it seems, as evinced by the 58 percent number. And on the other end of the ledger, U.S.-based companies were responsible for more than a third of European startup acquisitions.\nThat all points to a robust cross-Atlantic startup M&A market. What will become of it when a nearly inevitable correction occurs remains to be seen.

Entrepreneur First (EF), the London-headquartered company builder that invests in individuals “pre-team, pre-idea” to help create new technology startups, has raised $12.4 million in new funding led by Silicon Valley’s Greylock Partners.\nThe investment also sees Greylock partner and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman join the board. In a call, Hoffman described EF as an incubation model that “contradicts common wisdom,” and exactly the sort of idea he seeks to back.\nOther investors joining the round include Mosaic Ventures (I understand Mosaic’s Toby Coppel first introduced Hoffman to EF), Founders Fund, Lakestar Capital and Deep Mind founders Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman.\nNotable is that a number of EF alumni are also investing. They are Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang of Magic Pony Technology — the AI startup sold to Twitter for a reported $150 million and the company builder’s only financially significant exit to date — and Bryan Baum, who co-founded Represent, which was sold for a reported $100 million but went through the program before EF insisted on taking a stake in the companies it helps create.\nIt should also be noted that the new funding round is for operational costs and to further scale the EF program. In other words, it is entirely separate from the company builder’s investment fund from which it directly invests in the founders and startups it helps create. Therefore, this is more akin to EF as a startup in its own right raising funding.\nFounded back in 2011 by Alice Bentinck and Matt Clifford, EF bills itself as a “talent first” investor that targets the best technical and domain talent in Europe and Singapore — both recent graduates and also people already working at tech companies — and invites them to apply to its six-month program where they find co-founders and in turn found startups.\nThe EF program includes financial support in the form of a monthly stipend for living costs while founders find their co-founders and decide on an idea. This is then followed by pre-seed funding, in addition to office space, legal and administrative support and mentoring and advice from the EF team and external entrepreneurs from the wider U.K. and Singapore startup scene. There’s also a separate follow-on fund to co-invest in alumni companies at the seed and Series A stage.\nThe idea is to help talented individuals become entrepreneurs, and companies be founded, that otherwise might not. To date, EF says it has helped more than 500 individuals on its program, who have built more than 100 companies with a total (mostly on paper) valuation exceeding $1 billion.\n“Even though I don’t like to invest outside of Silicon Valley, the ability to create a portfolio of great entrepreneurship and great companies is something I treat as a personal mission,” Hoffman tells me, noting that Bentinck and Clifford have created a “great model for creating new, deep tech companies on an incubation basis.”\n“I think where it’s helpful is when you have depth of tech talent, creativity, an interest in creating companies but an as yet only partially developed entrepreneurial culture,” he says when asked why a model like EF is needed outside Silicon Valley. (Separately, Clifford tells me EF has no plans to expand to the U.S.)\nI recount how in EF’s early days — albeit before it was anything like proven — a number of VCs I spoke to had doubts the company builder’s “pre-team, pre-idea” model could work. Hoffman sounds unsurprised.\n“The number of incubators and accelerators that have failed is huge,” he says, “so what happens is that most VCs tend to be ‘look, the real entrepreneurs are just willing to go and do it themselves,’ and I would say that is common sense wisdom. Common sense wisdom has a breadth of truth to it, [but] I like to look at where the common sense wisdom has a limitation and where there is a big opportunity.”\nHoffman says he can easily see “a universe in which there’s 20 or 30 or 40 cities, maybe even 50, where Entrepreneur First is integral to creating a set of interesting tech companies in those areas.” “You can reach scale if you get the formula right,” he argues, pointing to how Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator has grown in the last decade.\nSo why hasn’t anyone cloned EF’s model verbatim? Clifford says it’s partly network effects — a program like EF becomes more valuable the more quality founders and companies it adds — and whilst Reid doesn’t dispute this, the answer may be even simpler.\n“The reason why they haven’t been copied yet is that people don’t have a full recognition of the really interesting thing that Entrepreneur First is doing,” he says. “And of course they try to keep some of the secret sauce under the covers, too.”\nBefore I wrap up our call, I turn the subject to the thorny issue of Brexit. Given that a large part of EF’s current program takes place in London but attracts applicants from all over Europe, was the U.K.’s decision to vote to leave the EU a consideration before Greylock decided to invest?\n“I definitely thought about it,” says Hoffman. “The impact will I think be relatively harsh over the next five or 10 years, starting with the fact that I think people are under the illusion that there is an easy divorce from the EU.”\nWith that said — and factoring in that we don’t yet know what a post-Brexit world will look like — he reckons there’s still “easily enough headroom” in the U.K. to create world transforming companies.", "tags": "greylock-partners,entrepreneur-first", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/ef-greylock/", "id": "1538448"}, {"title": "Facebook fined €1.2M for privacy violations in Spain", "text": "Another privacy-related fine for Facebook in Europe: The Spanish data protection regulator has issued a €1.2M (~$1.4M) fine against the social media behemoth for a series of violations regarding its data-harvesting activities.\nSpain’s AEPD said an investigation into how Facebook collects, stores and uses data for advertising purposes found it is doing so without obtaining adequate user consent.\nIt says it identified two serious infringements and one very serious infringement of data protection law — with the total sanction breaking down to €300,000 for each of the first breaches and €600,000 for the second.\nThe regulator found Facebook collects data on ideology, sex, religious beliefs, personal tastes and navigation — either directly, through users’ use of its services or from third party pages — without, in its judgement, “clearly informing the user about the use and purpose”.\nNot obtaining express consent of users to process sensitive personal data is classified as a very serious offense under local DP law.\nFacebook’s use of web browsing cookies was also found in violation of privacy laws, with the regulator saying it confirmed users are not informed that their information will be processed through the use of cookies when they are browsing non-Facebook pages that contain Facebook’s ‘Like’ button social plug in — noting that while some of the use of this data is declared as being for advertising, other use is “secret”, i.e. not disclosed by the company.\n“This situation also occurs when users are not members of the social network but have ever visited one of its pages, as well as when users who are registered on Facebook browse through third party pages, even without logging on to Facebook. In these cases, the platform adds the information collected in said pages to the one associated with your account in the social network. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the information provided by Facebook to users does not comply with data protection regulations,” it noted.\nThe regulator is also unhappy that Facebook does not delete harvested data once it has finished using it — saying it had been able to verify Facebook does not delete web browsing habits data, but  in fact “retains and reuses it later associated with the same user”.\nIt also found this to be true even when the company had been explicitly requested to delete data by a user.\n“Regarding data retention, when a social network user has deleted his account and requests the deletion of the information, Facebook captures and treats information for more than 17 months through a deleted account cookie. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the personal data of the users are not canceled in full or when they are no longer useful for the purpose for which they were collected or when the user explicitly requests their removal, according to the requirements of the LOPD [local data protection law], which represents a serious infringement,” it said.\nThe AEPR, which noted it liaised with other DPAs — in Belgium, France, Germany (Hamburg) and the Netherlands, which also have their own separate investigations into these issues, initiated following Facebook’s 2015 T&Cs change — said Facebook’s existing privacy policy was judged to contain “generic and unclear terms”, and to “inaccurately” refer to the use it will make of the data it collects.\nThe regulator asserted that a Facebook user “with an average knowledge of the new technologies does not become aware of the collection of data, nor of their storage and subsequent treatment, nor of what they will be used”.\nIt also points out that unregistered Internet users would not be unaware that the social network collects their browsing data — something that has already got Facebook into trouble with other European DPAs.\nCommenting on the regulator’s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us the company intends to appeal the decision, while also noting that its European business is (currently) regulated under Irish data protection rules, where its EU HQ is sited.\nIt provided the following statement:\nThe size of the AEPR fine is of course a mere pinprick for Facebook whose 2016 revenue was $27.64BN. So really its appeal against the fine is about the company trying to bat away any perception that it violates privacy by refuting the substance of the violations being asserted here.\nBut seen through the prism of stricter incoming EU data protection rules, under the new GDPR regime which comes into force next May, there are certainly serious financial considerations for Facebook’s business pertaining to privacy — as the new EU regime includes a far larger stick to beat companies that are judged to have violated data protection rules while also tightening up privacy rules by, for example, expanding the definition of personal data and giving EU citizens the right to ask for their data to be deleted.\nCompanies will be facing fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for privacy violations under GDPR. So, in Facebook’s case, privacy-related fines could start to scale to over a billion dollars. And penalties of that size aren’t something the tech giant can too often and too easily sweep under its revenue carpet.\nEven as GDPR strengthens the consent requirements for processing personal data, and expands the risk of holding and processing lots of personal data.\nIn addition, a company like Facebook, which processes data across multiple EU Member States’ territories, may find the new regulation creates a situation where it faces more concerted action from other DPAs, i.e. beyond their local data authority where they’ve established a European base. So, in Facebook’s case, it may not so easily be able to claim to be only under the jurisdiction of the Irish DPA. And in Europe, it’s fair to say that some DPAs are decided more pro-privacy than others.\nAsked about its GDPR preparations, Facebook previously told us it has designated a cross-functional team to “fully analyze the legislation and help us understand what this would mean from a legal, policy and product perspective” — saying this is “the largest cross functional team in the history of the Facebook family”.\nIt is also now looking to recruit a data protection officer — a position mandated under GDPR.\n“Ahead of next May we are working with our product, design and engineering teams to enhance existing products and build new products in a way that simultaneously provides an intuitive, user-centric experience and permits us to meet our obligations under the GDPR,” added Stephen Deadman, Facebook’s deputy chief global privacy officer, in a statement.", "tags": "gdpr,general-data-protection-regulation,terms-of-service", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/facebook-fined-e1-2m-for-privacy-violations-in-spain/", "id": "1538681"}, {"title": "Typeform, a platform for ‘conversational’ data collection, raises $35M", "text": "Filling out forms online and on mobile can be a tedious and bug-ridden — yet annoyingly necessary — experience. Today, a startup called Typeform has raised a significant round of capital to help fund its mission to change all that, with a platform that the startup claims gets its customers much better results because the interactive experiences created on it are more intuitive and thus easier to engage with.\nThe startup, based out of Barcelona, today announced a Series B of $35 million led by General Atlantic as it drives deeper into international markets, specifically the US; and expands its tools for developers with more analytics and artificial intelligence features to personalise the experience more. Along with the funding and in keeping with this platform focus, the company today is also announcing a new portal for developers.\n“We are proud to be the first company to transform the online data collection space by creating conversational forms. But now we’d like to take things further,” said Robert Muñoz, co-CEO and cofounder of Typeform, in a statement. He believes that Typeform is playing a role in “bridging the gap between data collection and customer interaction.”\nThis round also included participation from Index Ventures, Point Nine, and Connect Ventures, all previous backers.\nIn total, Typeform has now raised just over $52 million. The valuation with this round is not being disclosed but in its last funding of around $15 million two years ago, Typeform was worth $70 million post-money, David Okuniev, Typeform’s other cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. He added that this latest funding was an “up-round” and its valuation has grown. (I’m asking around to see if I can get a more current number and will update when and if I learn more.)\nHe said the company is ‘almost’ profitable.\nOther notable investors in Typeform include Anthony Casalena, CEO of Squarespace; Javier Olivan, VP of growth at Facebook; and Jay Parikh, Facebook’s VP of engineering.\nIt sometimes happens that the most successful startups are founded in response to an enterpreneur’s frustration with an existing product or service. And so it was the case with Typeform. Co-founders Muñoz and David Okuniev are both designers — specifically with focuses on interaction, UX, and UI — and were running their own agencies back in 2011, when they found themselves working jointly on a single brief (for a toilet company of all things).\nWhen the client asked for a new form to help pick up new business leads and more customer data, the pair were unable to find any suitable online templates or platforms that would not only get users to fill out their information with reliable regularity (no pun intended to the toilet company) but provide details that could be used for sales in the future.\n“We felt there was a lack of attention given to engaging users in the first place,” Okuniev said, who added that the interaction that had been invented for forms hadn’t changed since the 1990s. \nThe two set out to build something themselves, and then used that as the basis of what became Typeform, first launched in 2012, a more dynamic form-creating interface that presented questions one at a time. “We wanted to address that in a serious way, but you could also say it was accidental,” Okuniev said. “We had no intention of building a startup out of this.”\nToday, creating basic online forms is nearly a commoditised business, with companies like Google offering products like Forms free of charge, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter letting people create free polls and other services, and so on.\nUnsurprisingly, Typeform has been iterating on its original product over the years, and today concentrates more on APIs and other developer tools, which are offered in a freemium model based on usage and additional features.\nAt the same time, the startup has very much pushed into making its service something that one can use in any scenario where a user might need to enter data: from basic information entry like job application and contact forms; through to surveys; registration forms; shopping and order forms; online learning and tests; and invitations.\nThe flexibility of the platform, and the focus on making more dynamic interactive experiences, translates into results. Okuniev said that the average conversion rate on one of Typeform’s forms — whether it’s a questionnaire, customer service request, quiz, poll, order form, or something else — is 57 percent, compared to a conversion rate of between 10 percent and 15 percent for more conventional forms. \nIts success is also playing out in user numbers. Today, Okuniev said that the company has 30,000 paying customers, and “a lot more” than this using its free tier. Customers include both small and medium sized businesses as well as Fortune 500 companies in the tech, retail, and hospitality industries.\nTypeform’s today describes its form-filling platform as “conversational”, but its original concept behind that pre-dates a lot of the talk we hear today about conversational AI, and bots.\nOn the other hand, Typeform’s ethos is also very contemporary: it focuses on presenting and asking for information using conversational language, and works on the basis of feeding questions one at a time and getting answers in return and tailoring subsequent questions based on those responses.\nThat being said, today, the startup does not use any AI in its platform, although it’s being considered, either by growing it in-house (today the company has around 170 employees, including engineers), or by partnering with an existing firm, or potentially through an acquisition.\n“AI is definitely on our minds,” Okuniev said. “We are doing some projects internally around user behaviour around form entry and we will be integrating that into the product soon. We want to help our customers generate more conversations, and we think our products could help with that.”\nThe focus on creating an interactive platform based around natural language is one reason why investors were interested in helping fund the startup to grow.\n“Digital forms are transitioning from a simple data-collection tool into an integral part of the customer engagement journey,” said Chris Caulkin of General Atlantic, in a statement.\nSo, too, is the platform flexibility. “If you think about the proliferation of device types and browsers, including forms and data collection can be a real pain point,” Caulkin said in an interview. “And the solution that Typeform has developed can be easily integrated and managed by the product, not the tech, team.”\nCaulkin is joining Typeform’s board with this round.\nThe interactivity and square focus on sales and customer relationships also makes the company a prime target for acquisition, in my opinion, with companies such as Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Microsoft/LinkedIn and many others all looking at better ways to help businesses interface with users, particularly across platforms with more tricky interfaces, like mobile. In the meantime, Typeform is also working on integrating more with other, existing platforms, such as Mail Chimp.", "tags": "crm,forms,general-atlantic,typeform", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/", "id": "1538674"}, {"title": "Bankin lets you save money on Yomoni", "text": "French fintech startup Bankin is partnering with another fintech startup, Yomoni.

The difference now is the government has written bulk collection into law. But the question is whether in doing so it has breached EU human rights law.\nIn a judgement handed down yesterday the Investigatory Powers tribunal said both sides saw the necessity for a reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ)’s grand chamber.\nDuring the course of this case, the ECJ has ruled on another challenge — brought against emergency surveillance legislation rushed through the UK parliament in 2014 (called DRIPA) — stating in December that “general and indiscriminate” state data retention regimes contravene EU law.\nBut while DRIPA was overturned by the ruling, it was temporary legislation and had already been sunsetted in the UK — replaced by a new surveillance regime: the Investigatory Powers Act. So it’s a legal challenge to the bulk powers contained within that current regime that’s ongoing here.\nAnd even though EU judges have already made it clear EU Member States cannot establish “general and indiscriminate” data retention regimes, the government is trying to drive a wedge between that finding and matters of national security, arguing that the use of bulk data capabilities is “critical” to national security.\nIntelligence agencies also told the court that if December’s ECJ Watson judgement — named for the Labour politician, Tom Watson, who brought the challenge — were applied in the field of national security it “would effectively cripple the SIAs’ [security and intelligence agencies’] Bulk Data capabilities”.\nThe tribunal, which was established in 2000 and prior to the fallout from the 2013 Snowden disclosures about government’s mass surveillance programs had never upheld a complaint against the agencies whose work it is tasked with overseeing, said in its judgement: “We have carefully considered the evidence before us, both from the Claimant and the Respondents, and we are persuaded that if the Watson Requirements do apply to measures taken to safeguard national security, in particular the BCD regime, they would frustrate them and put the national security of the United Kingdom, and, it may be, other Member States, at risk.”\n“By the end of the hearing it was clear that both parties either agreed to or saw the necessity for a reference to the Grand Chamber, and the need for it is, we suggest, obvious from this Judgment,” it added. “Neither party in the event contended that the questions we have considered are either acte clair, or acte éclairé as a result of the Watson judgment.”\nThe Guardian reports that part of the state evidence given to judges included a statement from MI5’s deputy director in which he claimed that without BCD it would be necessary for the intelligence agencies to carry out “other and more intrusive inquiries” — such as making “many more individual requests for CD [communications data] or use other more intrusive powers in order to narrow the scope of a search”.\n“The inability to use BCD would therefore involve greater intrusion into the privacy of individuals,” the MI5 deputy director also claimed.\nThe tribunal also heard evidence from agencies that in 2005, and on the basis of what they couched as “sensitive but fragmentary intelligence”, agencies had been able to apply filters to a BPD to reduce “pool of 27,000 candidates” down to one person who they claim was identified as a “suspected potential al-Qaida suicide bomber”.\nOn the other side of the argument, Privacy International’s lawyers pointed out that metadata in the modern Internet age is massively revealing about individuals — therefore necessitating “strict safeguards against the state accessing highly sensitive information about us”.\nThe group said it fundamentally disagrees with the government’s position that data access safeguards set out the Watson judgement — such as requiring a judge to approve access to highly sensitive information — should not apply to national security.\nThe UK’s now defunct DRIPA regime was rushed through parliament in 2014, and subsequently ruled unlawful under European Human Rights law by a UK high court in 2015 — after a civil rights group challenged it for targeting an overly broad range of data and having an extremely lax access regime.\nYet the government persisted in pushing to legislate for a permanent state surveillance regime that cements bulk collection as its foundational core, claiming such powers are necessary for counterterrorism efforts.\nAt the end of 2016 parliament passed the current legislative framework for investigatory powers, cementing the intelligence agencies’ old bulk processes into dedicated legislation. Previously agencies had relied on vague clauses in obscure and outdated laws to authorize their use of the powers (illegally, as it turned out).\nThe new IP Act has also expanded the UK state’s bulk collection via a new requirement for ISPs to retain browsing data on all their users for 12 months. Though, on the flip side, it also brings in a new oversight regime for use of the most intrusive powers based on warrants being authorized by ministers and judges. This does not apply to accessing the ISP browsing data, however.\nIn yesterday’s judgement the intelligence agencies’ oversight court refused Privacy International’s request to expedite the matter to the ECJ — which means it will likely take years more before the court makes a judgement.\nAt which point the UK will be further down the road of the brexit process of leaving the Union — and the government has said it wishes to remove the country from the jurisdiction of the ECJ.\nSo years more uncertainty are a given here.

Ride-hailing startup Taxify launched this week in London to a big PR-push and fanfare. Most of the coverage was about how this plucky startup was going to take on the Uber giant. But Taxify has now had to pause its operations in London after a transport union questioned if it had a license to operate, and official body Transport for London announced it would investigate Taxify’s operations. Meanwhile, the startup has been tweeting drivers that download and use its app not to say they are “employed by Taxify.”\nSo what is going on?\n(UPDATE: Taxify has now issued a statement saying it has “done everything in its power to comply with the local regulations, but is faced by aggression from TfL.” It says that running Taxify as a technology platform directing bookings to City Drive Services registered drivers is “completely compliant within the existing UK law, and is a common practice.” TfL has revoked the license held by City Drive Services).\nA few months ago, Taxify applied for a license to operate a taxi service in London. This is important, because there is a big misunderstanding going on here about what Taxify is: it’s actually fleet management software in the cloud. Cab firms sign up for it, and use it to replace their tired old booking software, while Taxify takes a low fee. In other words, Taxify doesn’t want to run cab or private car firms. It’s basically a tech front for licensed cab firms that could never build and manage such complex software themselves. But to launch in London, it needed a way in.\nWell-placed sources say Taxify reached out to TfL in April about launch, but TfL was “walling” the firm, say the sources. Faced with a slow-moving bureaucracy, Taxify went ahead and literally bought a local cab firm, City Drive Services. This has a licence to operate with TfL, trading under two brand names, Avanti Car Service CityDrive and Sigma Car Service.\nFor Taxify is not just a plucky little startup taking on Uber — it’s now backed by Chinese ride-hailing tech giant Didi Chuxing in China.\nSomehow, Taxify thought that just by buying a cab firm with a license, installing its cloud services and apps with the drivers, it could would then have carte blanche to launch its service in London.\nEr, no. Taxi regulation doesn’t work like that.\nThe powerful GMB Union wrote to TfL saying: “The decision to acquire an operator and not advise Transport for London (TfL) of a fundamental change to licensing conditions seems incompatible with the law.” It questioned whether the firm is “fit and proper” to hold a licence with TfL, asking about driver safety, and saying there is “obfuscation” about how Taxify actually works and operates.\nThey may well have a point.\nTaxify is clearly trying to shoe-horn its service into London, not by encouraging local players to sign up for its service, but by literally acquiring a local player and launching. It’s not clear yet whether it had actually outlined this to TfL.\nBut Founder and CEO Markus Villig says he has spoken to lawyers about the arrangement: “We have literally sent them (TfL) an email every 3 days, so they knew very well we were launching.”\nA TfL spokesperson said: “Taxify is not a London licensed private hire operator. We are urgently investigating the nature and extent of its activities and will take action where appropriate.”\nTaxify launched in Estonia in 2013 and now operates in 18 countries, mainly emerging markets like Eastern Europe and Africa. The startup claims to have more than 2.5 million customers, and recently announced a strategic partnership with Didi Chuxing in China.\nIt has an “all-in-one solution for taxi companies.” Basically, a booking system with a consumer-facing app. Traditional taxi companies use Taxify’s web-based dispatcher and fleet management systems to manage their back-end and unite under Taxify’s consumer-facing app to stay competitive against expanding networks like Hailo and Uber. That then lowers Taxify’s costs, allowing them to charge less. It then charges the cab firm a low monthly fee of about €12-15 per driver per month.\nTaxify’s other focus is its rapidly growing Local Partner program, which allows entrepreneurs to set up their local Taxify business using a franchise model and become a city manager on a revenue share model.\nUPDATE: Taxify has now issued the below statement:", "tags": "taxify", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/taxifys-london-launch-halted-after-transport-regulator-mounts-investigation/", "id": "1537936"}, {"title": "Equifax breach disclosure would have failed Europe’s tough new rules", "text": "U.S. consumers hearing the news yesterday of a massive Equifax data breach, which the company revealed potentially affects 143 million consumers, and includes data such as names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, drivers’ licenses and — for a subset of hundreds of thousands — credit card information too, not only had to contemplate the horrendous scale of the thing.\nThey were also left to grapple with an Equifax ’emergency response line’ that hung up on them, and an Equifax data breach ‘help’ website that appears to raise a lot more questions than it answers — not least the core consideration that it’s requiring desperately worried consumers to trust a company that has failed to protect their personal data with more of their personal data, by inputting it into a web form, just to check whether they might be affected by the breach.\nAnd that’s before you even consider whether Equifax is trying to use the site’s terms of service to get users to waive their rights to bring a class action lawsuit against it — as appears to be the case. Which would be spectacularly unclassy, to say the least.\nThe cherry on this unlovely layer cake is the fact the credit checking company states it found out about the breach on “July 29 of this year” — while the unauthorized access apparently occurred “from mid-May through July 2017”.\nWhich means it’s given itself well over a month before deigning to tell consumers their personal data might be in the hands of identity thieves.\nThat might not seem so bad if you compare it to the current biggest (known) data breaches — affecting at least 500M Yahoo accounts, and more than 1BN Yahoo accounts — which took place years before the company disclosed the intrusions to the public, although it’s not clear when exactly Yahoo itself discovered the breaches.\nEven so, 40 days remains an awfully long time for consumers to be kept in the dark about the fact their identities and other highly sensitive personal data might be being traded by hackers, used to compromise other services, and sold to spammers for targeted spearphishing attacks.\nEquifax does not explain the length of time it took to inform the public about the breach. And yesterday said it “will” be writing directly to affected individuals, and is “in the process of” contacting state and federal regulators. So, very clearly, the company hasn’t been spending any of the past 40 days warning affected individuals or informing data watchdogs that its systems had been breached.\nThe US does not currently have a federal law requiring companies to inform the public about data breaches, though one was proposed in 2015 under President Obama which would have set a 30-day notification requirement, but it failed to get support.\nAnd while the vast majority of states have enacted breach notification statutes of their own at this point, and some have stricter notification requirements than the 2015 proposal, others don’t. It’s a patchwork — and therefore a lottery for U.S. consumers.\nOver the pond in the European Union the story is different. A single breach notification standard for personal data was agreed at the end of 2015 — and is set to come into force in May 2018, under the incoming GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).\nThis will set a data breach notification bar across the bloc of “not later than 72 hours” after a data controller has become aware of an intrusion.\nThere are some caveats to this portion (Article 33) of the regulation (phrases like “without undue delay and, where feasible”, and some potential for exclusion based on the type of data being breached (“unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”).\nBut the expectation is clearly that data controllers must disclose a personal data breach to a national supervisor data authority, at the very least, radically sooner than the ’40 days later’ which Equifax reckons is an acceptable disclosure timeframe.\n(While the type of data involved in the Equifax breach is clearly highly sensitive, so this incident would seem a very unlikely candidate for qualifying for a notification exemption under GDPR.)\nAnother change Europe’s incoming rules are bringing is a big stick to drive compliance for the new breach notification standard, as companies that do not comply with the new rules risk very stiff penalties for failing to do so.\nIn the case of non-compliance over breach notification, the GDPR gives data watchdogs the power to issue fines of up to €10M (~$12M) — or up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of a company’s preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\nIn Equifax’s case its 2016 operating revenue was ~$3.145BN. So — under the GDPR regime — the company might have faced a fine of around $62.9M if it hadn’t reported this data breach multiple weeks sooner than it chose to. (Indeed, it’s expecting its full year 2017 revenue to be even higher, between $3.395BN and $3.425BN, so this theoretical fine inflates to as much as $68.5M.)\nWhich does rather give pause for thought.\nIf you’re a multinational corporation processing the personal data of EU citizens those sorts of figures probably send some rather large shivers down the CEO’s spine.\nEquifax does indeed have a European presence, and has also said that some UK consumers are affected by the breach — writing yesterday that as part of its investigation it “also identified unauthorized access to limited personal information for certain UK and Canadian residents”, and adding: “Equifax will work with UK and Canadian regulators to determine appropriate next steps.”\nSo if these events had been shifted just a few months into the future Equifax might well have been forced to handle the breach disclosure very differently — or else it would be risking a very large fine under GDPR.\nThe question then would be, would it have informed the UK regulatory of the breach within 72 hours whilst continuing to keep U.S. data watchdogs and U.S. consumers in the dark? That wouldn’t seem like great domestic PR.\nThe aim of Europe’s new rules is of course to encourage companies that collect and store consumers’ personal data not to treat the security of that data as an afterthought. And large fines for failure is certainly one way to grease the pipe of security spending among corporates.\nAs the UK’s DPA warns on its website in an FAQ about the new breach notification rules: “In light of the tight timescales for reporting a breach – it is important to have robust breach detection, investigation and internal reporting procedures in place.”\nWhile an interesting potential side-effect of the new, tougher regime is whether it will end up forcing higher standards on non-European businesses, especially those in the U.S. — given many do handle EU citizens’ data, and will therefore need to reconfigure their processes to meet the bloc’s new standard.\n(The GDPR also expands the definition of what personal data is, and brings additional requirements such as a right for consumers to see what information is held about them and have it deleted on request — so there are other big changes incoming.)\nWe’ve reached out to Equifax in the UK for comment and will update this post with any response.\nIn a statement, the deputy commissioner of the UK’s data protection watchdog, commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone, told us: “Reports of a significant data loss at US-based Equifax and the potential impact on some UK citizens gives us cause for concern. We are already in direct contact with Equifax to establish the facts including how many people in the UK have been affected and what kind of personal data may have been compromised.”\n“We will be advising Equifax to alert affected UK customers at the earliest opportunity,” he added.\nI’ll leave you with this final food-for-thought:\n", "tags": "computer-security,data-breach,equifax,security", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/equifax-breach-disclosure-would-have-failed-europes-tough-new-rules/", "id": "1537814"}, {"title": "Straight outta Siberia — inDriver raises $5M for its flat-rate ride-hailing app", "text": "You’d think all the business models around on-demand taxis and cars had been invested, but straight out of Siberia comes another one.\nRide-hailing app inDriver has raised a $5 million Series A round from Russian venture fund LETA Capital. They aim to use this cash to launch inDriver in India, the USA and Canada, where the service will of course compete with Uber, Lyft and Ola Cab.\nHow on earth will they attempt this, rather optimistic, feat? Well, for starters, drivers themselves pay for to access the app, rather than the app’s operation effectively being subsidised by venture capital, as the other are. Next, inDriver is a decentralized, bid-style service, where the passenger enters the price he or she is willing to pay, while the driver accepts the order only upon agreement of the fare. inDriver does not influence price formation and doesn’t take a commission from drivers. All drivers do is simply pay by the hour to use the app, at a flat rate. A passenger can pay either with cash, or with credit card, but payment happens only directly between driver and rider.\nThe service’s simplicity means it has expanded to 70 cities in Russia and neighbouring markets. It claims to have about 7 million installations across iOS, Android and Windows Phones. Each month inDriver’s users make around 4-5 million trips, and the total number of trips is close to 100 million, they claim. inDriver also offers the option to travel between cities, much like BlaBlaCar.\nThe inDriver service was created in Yakutsk – a small town in Siberia. Their story goes that during a freezing winter day on Christmas Eve, when the temperature fell to -49°F, all the local taxi services simultaneously doubled their prices. To fight this, some students formed a public group on the VK.com social network (a clone of Facebook), where anyone could submit an application for a ride, and those who owned cars could accept their calls for help. After a year the group had 50,000 subscribers. Later, Yakutian tech entrepreneur Arsen Tomskiy “bought” the group from its creators (only in Russia could you buy a VK group…) , releasing a mobile app based on the group. QED.\ninDriver says its has been profitable from its first year of existence, because the company does not subsidize its drivers, like Uber does. When the app is launched in a new city, it is free for all drivers for the first several months, and later the company adds a subscription fee to access the order database. In Russia, depending on the city, the price can vary from $0.50 to $2 per hour.

In addition, EatWith will continue its existing partnership with TripAdvisor, which CrunchBase also lists as a backer.\nMeanwhile, VizEat says the acquisition of EatWith makes it the leader for enabling social eating experiences with locals and puts the startup at the forefront of the sharing economy within the food and travel sectors. It claims more than 25,000 hosts across 130 countries, with localised versions of its app available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Chinese.\nThe roll up of EatWith follows a similar acquisition in 2015 when the company gobbled up Paris-based Cookening, an early pioneer in the dine with a local space.", "tags": "eatwith,vizeat", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/vizeat-swallows-eatwith/", "id": "1536120"}, {"title": "Blackmoon to ICO its blockchain-based platform for tokenized investment funds", "text": "As the Blockchain and Crypto world gathers pace, vehicles to allow for the creation, promotion and management of crypto investment funds are growing. The Iconomi Digital Assets Management Platform enables users to invest and manage various digital assets. Meanwhile, Melonport is building a blockchain protocol for digital asset management, initially built on the Ethereum platform. This is basically a framework for blockchain-enabled hedge funds.\nRight now, most tokenized investment vehicles are either fully crypto-oriented or pegged to a tradable asset, like the U.S. dollar or gold. But creating access to fiat investment opportunities would diversify the income sources while at the same time retaining all the benefits of the crypto universe, such as transparency. Additionally, investors would get a higher return, because tokenized funds are much more cost-efficient than traditional ones.\nNow, Blackmoon Financial Group, a financial technology and investment management company, has launched Blackmoon Crypto (BMC), a blockchain-based platform for — guess what — tokenized investment funds. BMC claims it has found a way to make crypto investments legal and secure, which would be significant, given the recent SEC decision to classify some tokens as securities.\nThe move might not be considered so worthy of note, were it not for the fact that these are not a bunch of pie-in-the-sky, fly-by-night crypto cowboys. For one, the company has attracted $3.5 million in venture capital investment from Target Global, AN&N Investments, Flint Capital, and several other private investors. And right now, Blackmoon’s lending marketplace is operating in 9 countries and exceeds $100M in deals volume, while reaching $13M in monthly volumes.\nLast Friday it passed a $10M pre-ICO threshold with more than 2500 paid accounts. As a result, BMC closed its pre-sale after the first 2 weeks, indicating a strong public interest in the project and the forthcoming ICO. It’s ICO is now slated for September 12th.\nThe idea is to offer a new standard for tokenized investment vehicles that will bridge the gap between fiat and crypto universes by creating a way for asset managers to create and manage legally compliant tokenized funds. This would include everything from technology and infrastructure to legal framework and corporate structuring. Eventually any experienced and approved investment manager would be able to create a fund based on Blackmoon Crypto’s platform. (The platform and its tokens are based on Ethereum and also the Waves blockchain).\nThe company is led by entrepreneurs and investors Oleg Seydak and Ilya Perekopsky (former VP and COO of VK, the Facebook clone previously founder buy Pavel Durov, who went on to create Telegram).\nIn addition, two well-known players in asset management are supporting the ICO. The first is Nicolas Tranter – founding director of Bibbsworth, which advises institutional asset managers in the UK and Europe, and is based in London. The other is John Hyman – partner at Ondra Partners, a leading corporate finance advisory boutique.\n“Setting up the proper investment structure is a costly endeavour. Not all tokenized funds do this, which leads to greater regulatory risk for investors,” says Seydak. He thinks there needs to be an industry standard for setting up tokenized investment vehicles that would then be able to attract investments from private individuals and institutional investors of any kind. “That’s what the Blackmoon Crypto platform does; it pays attention to regulatory risk and bridges the gap between the fiat and crypto worlds.”\n“Tokenized funds are more cost-efficient thanks to lower infrastructure and setup costs,” Sergey Vasin, Chief Investment Officer of Blackmoon. “This economy is transmitted to investors in the form of higher net return. The cherry on top is that, fund tokens are also immediately tradable.”", "tags": "blackmoon", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/blackmoon-to-ico-its-blockchain-based-platform-for-tokenized-investment-funds/", "id": "1536913"}, {"title": "Ahead of iPhone X day, Samsung teases 2018 foldable phone launch plan", "text": "Apple is preparing to draw scores of eyes to Cupertino later today as it unboxes a clutch of new iPhones, including a new premium handset, called the iPhone X, slated to have a near bezel-less OLED display, a 3D face unlock feature and a $1,000+ price-tag, while bringing various new camera and feature tweaks — many of which have leaked in recent weeks.\nEven so, the new iPhones are set to look like, well, iPhones — aka slabs of expensively shiny glass.\nSo what better time for rival Samsung to tease that it might finally be nearing the point of outing something rather different: A smartphone with a foldable screen — encouraging consumers who might be thinking of shelling out serious bucks for Apple’s new glass slabs to think twice.\nBloomberg reports that Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung’s mobile business, has said the company is setting its sights on 2018 to release a smartphone with a bendable display.\n“As the head of the business, I can say our current goal is next year,” he told reporters. “When we can overcome some problems for sure, we will launch the product.”\nHe was speaking at a press event in South Korea announcing the Galaxy Note 8 phablet to domestic media. The future foldable phone is intended to sit in the same Galaxy Note portfolio line-up, according to his comments.\nSamsung has been teasing the fact it’s working on a bendable device for multiple years now — showing investors a range of folding prototypes in 2013, and teasing bendy screen concepts (branded Youm) at CES that year. Though its tests date back further still, while it’s been showing off concept videos of flexible devices for a similarly long time.\nBut while Samsung has been happy to scatter suggestive tidbits about its folding phone plans over the years, the date for a potential commercial release has never been firmed up. Instead possible release years have been mentioned then pushed further forward in time — apparently as it encountered new manufacturing complications.\nSo it’s fair to say that the latest claim — that 2018 might finally be the year of the folding phone  — should be taken with a large pinch of salt. Especially as the timing of the tease coincides with the most important date in the Apple calendar: iPhone X day.\nAnd, well, let’s face it, concept smartphones don’t have a great record of ever seeing the light of day either.\nEven if you assume Samsung has made some progress on its bendable prototypes, having worked on the concept for more than five years at this point, there’s no doubt that creating a screen robust enough to be opened and closed (and prodded) as much as 150 times+ a day by touchscreen-addicted humans is a huge challenge.\nAnd after the flaming disaster of the Galaxy Note 7, which had to be recalled after some batteries caught fire, the risk-margin for Samsung on this potential release must be very tight indeed…\nNo one wants a folding phone if that means screen glitches and/or a handset that feels tacky and whose dimensions hark back to the heft of late 1990s mobile devices.\n(For the record, Samsung’s folding phone has been rumored to be called the Galaxy X. So Apple’s choice of premium brand name for its top tier new iPhone is probably causing more than a little irritation in South Korea.)\nWe’re liveblogging Apple’s launch event here, and here’s details on how to watch the keynote. So stay tuned for all the news from Cupertino.\nBloomberg also reported Samsung’s Dong-jin saying it’s working with audio device maker Harman, which it acquired last year, to develop an artificial intelligence-enabled speaker for voice commanding to play music and conduct other tasks — aka an Amazon Echo inspired Apple HomePod clone in the making.", "tags": "smartphone,harman,iphone", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/ahead-of-iphone-x-day-samsung-teases-2018-foldable-phone-launch-plan/", "id": "1539162"}, {"title": "Zilingo raises $18M for its fashion e-commerce service in Southeast Asia", "text": "Southeast Asia-based fashion marketplace Zilingo has closed an $18 million Series B funding round led by Sequoia Capital India and Burda Principal Investments.\nZilingo was founded less than two years ago by ex Sequoia analyst Ankiti Bose (CEO) and former Yahoo engineer Dhruv Kapoor (CTO). The basic vision is to help Southeast Asia’s thriving independent fashion sellers and boutiques stores expand their businesses online.\nThe startup had existed largely under the radar until it raised $8 million around one year ago. This newest round includes participation from existing backers Venturra Capital, SIG, Beenext and Wavemaker, as well as new investors — two angels — Tim Draper and Manik Arora, ex IDG Ventures India head, via his family office fund.\nThis new funding is being put to work growing Zilingo’s presence in Southeast Asia, and particularly Indonesia — the region’s largest economy. The startup said it has grown its revenue over 10-fold and added 5,000 new merchants during the past twelve months. It currently ships to eight countries, with seller hubs in Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia, with five company offices.\n“A large part of this round is dedicated to growing in Indonesia,” CEO Bose told TechCrunch in an interview. “There’s no other comparable fashion brand, so we probably have a window of about a year to make to big before others follow.”\nZilingo expanded into Indonesia earlier this year after Bose relocated to Jakarta to learn more about the market. Some six months into operating there, she’s impressed by the opportunities of the country.\n“I’ve never seen a market that’s so ready to consume consumer internet products,” she said. “We are seeing 85 percent growth each month, that’s not something anyone has seen in other Southeast Asia markets. People spend a bit less on every transaction, but the behavior is crazy and they shop more times.”\n“We were initially really worried about logistics, because Indonesia is an archipelago, but it hasn’t been that hard. If your expectations are correctly set, it’s a great market,” the Zilingo CEO added.\n\nAside from aiming to grow its share of the local market, Zilingo is also making moves overseas. It has just opened a B2B network that will allow fashion sellers in the U.S. and parts of Europe to purchase items direct from Zilingo at a competitive price for local resale.\n“There’s demand for that supply outside of Southeast Asia,” Bose said. “If you run a boutique in Europe or America, it’s likely you are procuring products from Asia but there are a lot of middlemen.”\nFor now though, the primary focus is Southeast Asia at this point.\nBose added that she’s particularly excited to work with Burda, which has emerged as one of the few traditional Series B investors in Southeast Asia after hiring ex-GREE investor Albert Shyy to head up the region.\n“These guys bring a whole new perspective on fashion and lifestyle,” she said in reference to Burda’s investment in Etsy and its global media portfolio, which includes brands such as Elle, Harper’s Bazaar, and InStyle.\n“It seems only yesterday that Zilingo started with a seed round from Sequoia India and most of the team based out of the Sequoia incubation space in Bangalore.

The bezel is minimal once again, and the Chinese phone maker claims to have trimmed the lower border down by a significant 12 percent.\nIt’s a pretty striking look — once again — and it fits with the biggest trend in devices this year, minimizing the bezel in exchange for maximum front screen size. It’s a train that Samsung, LG and (reportedly) Apple have all bordered to help stand out from the rest. Xiaomi went a little further last year when it removed the front speaker to optimize the screen, and it’s the same story this year. Again, it has opted for a piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology setup to minimize the speaker, but this time it actually occupies some space on the device rather than being buried last year, which had caused some audio issues.\nThere are some notable internal upgrades, including a higher quality camera that uses a Sony IMX386 sensor — bringing it up to par with the Mi 6 — and Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB RAM powering the phone.\nThe options start at 3299 RMB ($506) for 64 GB of storage, with 3599 RMB ($550) for 128 GB and 3999 RMB ($613) for 256 GB.

This time, as Reuters spotted, a single report from financial news site Caixin is saying that the Chinese government is considering banning cryptocurrency exchanges in China.\nIn particular, the report is saying that Chinese citizens won’t be able to use exchanges to buy bitcoins, ethers and more using Chinese yuan, and vice versa.\nCryptocurrencies aren’t banned per se, just exchanges. But do bitcoins have value in China if you can’t exchange them? That’s the main question and the reason why cryptocurrencies are crashing.\nThis is what it looks like on coinmarketcap.com right now:\n\nBitcoin is currently down 7.7 percent, Ethereum is down 11 percent, Bitcoin Cash (which is quite popular in China) is down 11.2 percent, etc. But if you go on Chinese exchanges, the crash is even more important.

Over in nearby Japan, one company is hatching an ambitious plan to offer a one-stop-service to let companies across the world take advantage of blockchain technology and IPOs. And all without violating financial regulations.\nTech Bureau currently helps companies with consultancy and a range of technical services, but it is preparing to introduce new platforms to cover nearly every aspect of the process of an ICO, also known as token sales, and chiefly that of raising capital.\nThe scope of ICO work will span developing the initial white paper (similar to a pre-IPO prospectus), to technical integrations, managing the sale process and even community management and marketing. On the technical side, it already operates its own “mijin” blockchain based on NEM protocol for developers for deployment and “Zaif” bitcoin exchange where coins are sold, so the final piece is facilitating the token sale itself.\nThe company this week announced that it has raised $15 million from Japan’s largest VC firm JAFCO to kickstart it plans. It previous raised $10 million. The money will be used to put the first building blocks in place, including hiring talent and opening at least four offices worldwide, to develop Japan’s first ICO platform, COMSA, and take advantage of the interest in bitcoin in the country and a boom in crypto currency funding that has already passed $1.7 billion this year.\nCOMSA will take a different approach to platforms like ICOage and ICO.info in China. The Chinese services were ideal for buyers, offering a one-stop solution to buying into ICOs, and companies selling tokens, since they could almost guarantee that a chunk of the token sale would come from China. With COMSA, Tech Bureau wants to be more selective and tie the sale process into its other services.\n“We help implement token/blockchain tech to businesses in a way that businesses can add value to the tokens they issue,” CEO Takao Asayama told TechCrunch. “We will be a catalyst or I would say a conduit between the decentralized public blockchain world and the centralized, legit and working businesses.”\nAsayama told TechCrunch that the platform could host 20-30 token sales before the end of next year, all of which will be with “legit and working businesses.” Four are slated to come this year, with crowdfunding site Campfire and public-listed Premium Water Holdings set to go first.\nThe first step of the process seems Tech Bureau help companies wanting to hold ICOs analyze how they can implement blockchain technology into their business, a critical factor that is often overlooked by the fact that companies can raise considerable amounts by token sales. A genuine integration is one factor that would be used to judge whether a token sale is legitimate, or not. Another — and the big crypto question, being asked by the SEC and other regulators worldwide — is whether the token on offer falls under securities law.\nOn that subject, Japan has been fairly accommodating to bitcoin as an asset — it is accepted fairly widely by retailers — but, like most other countries, its position on ICOs is less clear, particularly if and when tokens fall under securities laws.\nThat doesn’t concern Tech Bureau, because the company does extensive diligence and already provides advice around whether a token sale structure might fall under the jurisdiction of financial regulators.\n“As long as you handle only non-security tokens, it is ok,” explained Asayama. “Once it circulates in the market, it becomes virtual currency. We help implement token/blockchain tech to businesses that way they can add value to the tokens they issue.”\nThe plan is to take the model global — in terms of both token issuers and token buyers — and already 50 percent of inbound interest for ICO companies is from outside of Japan, Asayama said. Given the international scope, some level of risk management will be implemented with users. Those based in China, for one, are likely to be excluded from the COMSA platform.\nWhile the platform is still being developed, Tech Bureau has already attracted 150,000 registered users who, once it is online, will be able to invest in ICOs hosted on COMSA. One key component to attracting that audience is COMSA’s own ICO.\nYes, of course the platform that will host ICOs is running its own ICO first!\nAsayama said that the VC cash will go towards constructing the business, and hiring, but its own ICO will fund the development of the COMSA platform and other blockchain-based services that for integration\nThe plan is to raise money through an uncapped sale to registered COMSA users following an initial $10 million pre-sale to major investors. Asayama said the sale would uncapped to prevent so-called ‘pump and dump’ strategies from investors who get into a closed cap sale and release a token into the market at a higher price once it is generally available to all.\n“We consider this a platform not a one-time token sale,” he explained. “And we have confidence of ongoing growth in value of the CMS token.”\nHe said an ideal sale would raise upwards of $50 million. The token sale itself will run from October 2 to November 6, according to details on the dedicated website.\nToken ownership will include a number of benefits, including decisive votes on potential COMSA projects.\n“If there are some challenging businesses coming along with certain risk, we can take community vote, based on the number of our tokens they own. The community can decide if they want that business to go ICO or not,” Asayama explained.\nExperts have warned that China’s ICO ban could allow other global markets to take the lead on token sales, and it looks like that’s exactly the objective here.\n“With a foresighted approach, Japan appears to be taking the lead in managing the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. Major venture capital companies are pouring in money, and the industry is well on its way to becoming a major economic force,” said Lon Wong, President of the NEM.io Foundation which has collaborated with Tech Bureau.\nNote: The original version of this story has been updated to provide more accurate information around the planned token sale.", "tags": "blockchains,cryptocurrencies,icos,japan", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/japanese-startup-plans-one-stop-ico-platform-fueled-by-25m-from-vcs-and-a-60m-ico/", "id": "1537812"}, {"title": "China’s UrWork invests in Indonesia’s ReWork via $3M deal as WeWork rivalry heats up", "text": "UrWork, the unicorn that is competing with WeWork in China, is following its American rival’s lead by extending its reach in Southeast Asia after it took part in a $3 million funding round for Indonesia-based ReWork.\nThe round, which is described as pre-Series A, was led by China-U.S. firm ATM Capital and Indonesia’s Convergence Ventures.

It has 88 locations in 22 cities in its native China, but it is planning an aggressive overseas expansion into 32 cities worldwide over the next three years. That’s just as WeWork doubles down on China, where it recently launched a local business that is aimed at rapidly growing the eight spaces it currently operates across the Greater China region.\nJust as we have witnessed Chinese tech firms moving rapidly into Southeast Asia to grab a slice of the fast-growing startup ecosystem, so the co-working unicorns have taken aim at the region, and Indonesia — its largest economy — in particular.\nWeWork expanded into Southeast Asia via the acquisition of Singapore-based SpaceMob, and it has set aside a budget of $500 million to grow in Southeast Asia, which houses over 600 million people.\nAlready, UrWork has a location in Southeast Asia via Singapore in addition to a presence in the U.S., but now it is looking to expand into Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, through this deal.\n“Southeast Asia’s economy and technology market are extremely promising with huge growth potential for both local ventures and for China based businesses.

There’s no immediate plan for regional expansion, but the it is looking at possible moves into the Philippines and Malaysia next year.\nBusiness-model wise, ReWork typically works with property owners on a revenue-share basis, but, as it eyes more rapid expansion, it is in talks with larger real estate companies over joint ventures that could add multiple spaces to its presence in one go, Hendriadi said.\nIt’s also taken an interesting twist on expanding via a tie-up with commercial property group Ismaya. That deal will see small ReWork outposts opened alongside Ismaya locations, which include shopping malls and office buildings, to give members more flexibility with work options and help reach new demographics.\nEchoing others in the co-working industry in Asia, including aggregator FlySpaces, Hendriadi said the main meat of the business is in established companies and corporates, rather than digital nomads or small teams — although they are also catered to. She believes the current system is seriously lacking, and that’s the gap ReWork aims to plug.\n“Traditional serviced offices are very soul-less with very small shared facilities,” the ReWork CEO said. “All you want to do is go to your office and close the door, but sometimes it doesn’t even have windows!”\n\nIt’s going to get interesting when WeWork moves into Indonesia via SpaceMob, which is working on entering the country, while Naked, another massive competitor to WeWork from China, is also casting glances at Southeast Asia.\nFor now, ReWork — and UrWork — have the advantage, and investors seem impressed.\n“Vanessa has grown Rework’s members and revenues quickly with healthy margins great retention, all while maintaining strong capital discipline.

Treebo just announced a $45 million round of its own last week, and it has been busy investing in TV ads to grow its brand, so the timing of this new OYO raise is particularly noteworthy.\n\nIn a statement, OYO CEO Agarwal said he also intends to invest in technology and improving the customer experience.\nOne area where it is diversifying out is with the younger generation. OYO launched millennial-focused brand Townhouse — “your friendly neighborhood hotel” that also serves as a breakfast/co-working venue — in January. Agarwal suggested that the product, which is aimed at the mid-market audience with prices upwards of 3,500 INR ($55), will be expanded nationwide after a promising start to life.\n“OYO has solidified its position in India as the leading accommodation brand for consumer affordability and high quality standards. We’re excited to continue to support OYO as they further expand their position in India and bring the OYO promise of affordability and elevated hospitality to other markets around the world,” SoftBank’s Justin Wilson, who sits on the OYO board, said in a prepared comment.", "tags": "ritesh-agarwal,japan,vodafone,softbank-group", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/oyo-raises-250m/", "id": "1537120"}, {"title": "Chatbot startup founder sees Southeast Asia potential despite slow start worldwide", "text": "Chatbots may have underwhelmed thus far, but the impact of the technology still has bags of potential in international markets where mobile messaging has been mainstream for years.\nThat’s the view of one startup that’s working to bring the benefit of bots to the mainstream in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and the largest economy in the growing region of Southeast Asia.\nIndonesia has been recognized as a global hotspot for social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in recent years, and messaging app adoption has been equally as strong with Line, Kakao, BlackBerry BBM and WhatsApp among the top choices for the country’s 260 million population.\nKata.ai, a Jakarta-based startup that recently raised $3 million, said it sees huge potential for many industries and segments to tap into the culture of chat to advance their business and customer relations. It operates a platform that lets brands and companies to operate chatbots using the native Bahasa Indonesian language, and not English which is not widely spoken with fluency.\n“We are helping brands to provide better engagement, sell stuff and open new revenue generation channels,” Irzan Raditya, CEO of parent company YesBoss Group. “Chat already has a foothold in Indonesia, but now we want to demystify AI and open up other technologies to underserved markets.”\nRight now, Kata.ai operates on a number of chat platforms, which include Facebook Messenger, Line, Telegram, Slack and BBM (which is still big in Indonesia), as well as Twitter and Skype.\nWhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging app, is a conspicuous absentee because the company has not yet opened its platform. However, that could change soon with this week’s announcement of plans to integrate business services into the app soon.\nYesBoss Group began as a personal assistant service, but it pivoted into chatbots when Raditya noticed that the only solutions were global — and therefore in English — which could only ever have limited impact in markets like Indonesia. He then went ahead and started the first local platform for bots.\n\nMobile operator Telkomsel is one of the startup’s most visible clients today, using its platform to power its own-name chat bot that lets customers top-up their balance, change packages and check other information. The company plans to use this new funding — led by Taiwan’s Trans-Pacific Technology Fund — to push business-wise by creating its own in-house sales team. The core tech itself needs development and so a significant portion of the round will go towards hiring the AI and big data talent required.\nThat’s a tough ask in Indonesia where, despite a large population, there’s a lack of tech talent and particularly individuals with experience in AI and chatbot-related fields. For now, though, Raditya isn’t thinking of opening overseas offices to suck up talent, instead he’s looking locally and for those willing to move (or return) to Indonesia.\nLikewise, there’s no immediate expansion plan, but he did suggest that the Kata.ai service will launch in new markets in Southeast Asia at some point next year. But with Indonesia forecast to account for half of the region’s fast-growing internet economy, the startup is at least starting out at ground zero.", "tags": "southeast-asia,indonesia,chatbot", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/chatbot-startup-founder-sees-southeast-asia-potential/", "id": "1536577"}, {"title": "Thailand’s Event Pop raises $2M to expand its ticketing service in Southeast Asia", "text": "Event Pop, a two-year-old digital ticketing startup from Thailand, has raised a Series A round of over $2 million to expand its product and move into new markets.\nThe round was led by Thai investors InVent, a subsidiary of the parent of operator AIS, and Kasikorn Bank’s $30 million Beacon fund.

A recent Goldman Sachs report estimated that more money was raised in the first half of 2017 by ICOs than early stage VC firms.\nDespite some promising projects, there is widespread concern around the accountability of all ICO projects and the potential for scams, money laundering and other illicit activity.\n“We are concerned about an increase in the use of ICOs to raise funds in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Those involved in an ICO need to be aware that some ICO structures may be subject to Hong Kong securities laws,” Julia Leung of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said in a statement.\nWhile Leung and her colleagues may be concerned, the SFC — which regulates Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets — isn’t dropping the hammer as China’s central bank did with its decision to immediately suspend ICOs and investigate around 60 companies that facilitate them.\nInstead, the Hong Kong-based body has warned those who take part in ICOs, which are also known as token sales, that they may be in breach of laws if what they sell is a security. Whether ICO tokens are a security is a million billion dollar question in itself. The SEC in the U.S. and Singapore’s MAS are among other regulators to have warned those involved in ICOs of securities laws which they may be violating.\nThe SFC also clarified that the regulations don’t simply apply to Hong Kong-based companies holding ICOs, but any entity worldwide that sells tokens to individuals based in Hong Kong.\nRegulatory concern has already prompted many companies to exclude citizens based in the U.S. and Singapore from token sales, and concerns from today’s memo may lead to others that are contemplating an ICO to add Hong Kong to that exclusion list.\nThat’s significant because not only is Hong Kong a major global financial hub, but it retains considerable business links with China, particularly around investment. You’d imagine, then, that today’s statement was triggered by yesterday’s China ban.\nKorea is another worry for ICO companies after its financial regulator issued a crackdown that was also announced this week.\nHere’s the full statement from the SFC:", "tags": "icos,hong-kong", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/hong-kong-ico-concern/", "id": "1535981"}, {"title": "Xiaomi aims to upstage the iPhone with successor to acclaimed bezel-less smartphone", "text": "Xiaomi’s bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone grabbed a huge amount of attention when it launched last October.

Its last device was a smash and there’s huge expectations on the next iPhone.\nAll eyes will be on Apple, which needs to release a device that distinguishes itself from the past few tick-tock iterations to boost its brand and shore up falling sales in China. From what we’ve seen so far from leaks, it appears that the next iPhone will include some radical changes, but in launching a day prior, Xiaomi will take the spotlight for 24 hours and lay the ground for direction comparisons with Apple’s next flagship.\nThe Mi Mix was a hit beyond Xiaomi’s usual pool of fans thanks to a stunning front design which is nearly all screen and very little bezel.\n\nAt the time that was a serious breakthrough — Xiaomi initially billed the Mi Mix as a concept device — but now screens are the hot topic for smartphones in 2017. LG and Samsung have unveiled devices with minimal bezels, running with the Mi Mix’s design lead, so naturally there’s plenty of anticipation over what Xiaomi has up its sleeve for the follow-up model.\nEarly leaks suggest an even smaller bezel — well of course! — with Qualcomm as-yet-announced Snapdragon 836 chipset and support for Android 8.0 Oreo off the bat.\nXiaomi isn’t saying too much for now… because why spoil the event when you’ve set it up so nicely.\n2017 has been a much better year for Xiaomi after it had struggled to maintain heady growth of its early days over the last two years.\nCEO Lei Jun admitted that Xiaomi had grown too fast when looking at its 2016 results, but this year it seems to have found its rhythm with impressive sales growth and a recent $1 billion loan to put the focus back on its international growth, which had stalled in recent times with little sign of success outside of China.\nIn that respect, the Mi Mix launch timing is ideal for Xiaomi.

In the U.S., the SEC has issued official warnings around the risks of ICOs, also known as token sales, but the Chinese government looks set to beat it to implementing regulation around the rapidly growing fundraising option.\nA notice from a committee led by China’s central bank [link in Chinese] today announced an immediate ban on ICO funding, which has “seriously disrupted the economic and financial order.”\nFinancial news site Caixin reported [link in Chinese] reported that the committee has prepared a list of 60 exchanges which will be subject to inspection and a report. In the meantime, there will be an ICO freeze in China.\nICOs involve raising funding by creating and selling new crypto tokens — commonly based on Ethereum — to investors. That’s led to comparisons with securities, with much speculation over whether financial regulators will look to regulate the space.\nThe Chinese committee voiced concern that some ICOs are financial scams and pyramid schemes. That echoes a recent warning from Singapore’s MAS.\n“ICOs are vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks due to the anonymous nature of the transactions, and the ease with which large sums of monies may be raised in a short period of time,” MAS, Singapore’s central bank, said in an August 1 statement.\nIt isn’t clearly exactly which companies are on the committee’s investigation list, but already two of China’s largest platforms for buying into ICOs — ICOage and ICO.info, which help connect companies selling tokens with buyers — have suspended their services and stopped taking on new projects. Both said their suspensions were voluntary.\nThe number of ICOs hosted this year has risen massively across the world. The total amount raised from token sales surpassed early stage investment spending from traditional venture capitals during the first half of 2017, according to a Goldman Sachs report.\nThis year to date, ICO fundraising is said to have topped $1.6 billion. Already, two companies’ coins have grown to a market cap of more than $1 billion, although the significance of that landmark is unclear since neither has a product in the market right now.\nChina, which houses one of the world’s most active bitcoin communities, has been a key part of the ICO boom, both in terms of companies selling tokens and buyers snapping them up.\nState media firm Xinhua reported in July that Chinese companies had raised $383 million from 105,000 investors during the first half of the year.\nThe SEC hasn’t made a firm move in the U.S. yet — despite making announcements — so all eyes will be on China to see what kind of mechanisms can govern ICOs, and indeed whether all types of ICOs will be regulated. It’ll also be interesting to watch the potential fall out of this crackdown on the market for ICOs, and crypto currencies generally, given the prominent role played by China.\nLong-time crypto watchers will recall 2013, when China banned exchanges from allowing people to buy into bitcoin and other crypto coins using the local yuan currency. The result was a huge price drop, but support for yuan deposits did return and the price if bitcoin has soared to new highs — most recently $5,000 on some exchanges.", "tags": "icos,initial-coin-offering,china", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/chinas-central-bank-has-banned-icos/", "id": "1535660"}, {"title": "GoGoVan becomes Hong Kong’s first $1 billion startup following merger deal", "text": "At our TechCrunch China event in June we discussed the bright future that Hong Kong’s startup scene has, despite some big challenges.

GoGoVan and others like it, including fellow Hong Kong company Lalamove, are often labeled as ‘Uber for delivery,’ but most customers are from the business world.\nGoGoVan has passed the $1 billion mark precisely because it is looking to go beyond the B2B market. It has merged with China-based 58 Suyun, a fellow logistics on-demand platform that is focused on serving consumers.\nBeyond the strategy of marrying a business-focused service with a consumer-focused offering, the deal is also complementary in terms of geographies. 58 Suyun — which is owned by online classifieds giant 58.com — is present in over 100 cities in China with 1.2 million registered drivers, while GoGoVan is present in eight cities in China as well as China, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea and India.\nThe merged entity — which will be called GoGoVan — plans to integrate the two businesses together to offer GoGoVan services in 58 Suyun’s locations, and bring 58 Suyun’s services outside of China. The newly formed company has a valuation of over $1 billion, its CEO Steven Lam told TechCrunch in an interview.\n“This deal make perfect sense for both sides,” Lam said. “We have Southeast Asia and China with a B2b focus, and that’s completely different from 58, which is in the consumer market. We have a leadership position in China and in some countries in Southeast Asia — we can do much more in Southeast Asia and beyond.”\n\nThere is also a common investor. Alibaba invested in GoGoVan via its entrepreneurship fund, and it backed 58.com’s 58 Home subsidiary, which operates 58 Suyun, in a $300 million round in 2015. GoGoVan, which was started in 2014 by five Hong Kong founders, has raised over $26 million from investors although its most recent Series C was undisclosed.\nLam said that post deal the company is looking to raise upwards of $200 million for expansion into two or three new markets next year. In 2019, he wants to move beyond Asia, perhaps into Australia and Europe, and list the company on a public market.\n“The plan is to make sure the company is ready to be listed, but it depends on the market situation. If we can be really profitable, we may even stay private,” Lam explained. He added that Hong Kong, which has seen a growth in interest from tech companies, could be the IPO destination, but GoGoVan is open to a U.S. listing, too.\nGoGoVan isn’t alone with this ambition. Lalamove is also beginning to explore opportunities to go public, too.

Before this deal, two-year-old Treebo had raised $23 million, including its $17 million Series B last year.\nStartups like Treebo and OYO, which has raised over $250 million from investors like SoftBank and Sequoia, have sprouted up to offer a tech-enabled response to the problem of vastly differing quality of hotels across India.\nThey propose a base standard for guests which includes clean linen, bedding, free WiFi and more, for a price range of 1,000-3,000 INR, or roughly $15-$50, per night. In addition, they use a mobile app as a virtual concierge service to help with check-in, orders, answer questions and more.\nThe idea is to set standards where none exist. That might not sound all that impressive in a Western context, but anyone who has traveled in India, or other parts of Asia, can attest to the peace of mind that these guarantees can give.\nTreebo claims to offer nearly 300 hotels (covering over 6,000 rooms) in more than 50 cities in India. Unlike OYO, it hasn’t ventured overseas. Co-founder Rahul Chaudhary told TechCrunch last year that the India opportunity is a large enough challenge to tackle. He estimates that budget hotels represent 65 percent of the national hotel market, which means roughly $15-20 billion in spend per year.\nThe company does differentiate from the competition slightly with its approach. Treebo operates a full franchise model which means it takes on hotels exclusively, working with hotel owners to provide its branding, customer acquisition channels, management software and more. In exchange, it takes a revenue cut that can be as high as 40 percent.\nOYO and others operate partial inventory, allowing some rooms at a hotel to be unlisted or available via other platforms. However, they have begun to move in the same direction as Treebo. Earlier this year, OYO said it had 30,000 rooms under full inventory, but it isn’t clear what portion of its total reach that is.\nTreebo said it plans to spend the new capital on improving its customer experience, marketing, tech and expansions.

Tj O’Shae, a former GrubHub W-2 employee who worked as a driver care representative from September 2015 to February 2016, echoed much of what plaintiff Raef Lawson testified.\nShe spoke about preferred drivers getting access to priority scheduling, acceptance rates, bonuses and a system that allowed GrubHub to see where their drivers were — even if they weren’t on a specific delivery — and “ghost orders.”\nBut before O’Shae took the stand, Lawson faced cross-examination by Michele Maryott, a lawyer for GrubHub.\n“You talked about the ghost orders and your claim you didn’t receive orders,” Maryott said. “You were making that up, weren’t you?”\n“No,” Lawson replied.\nGrubHub says ghost orders are not and were not a thing. Maryott referenced how GrubHub at one point told Lawson there was no such thing as a ghost order and then gave him tips on how to avoid missing delivery opportunities.\nMaryott also mentioned that it was possible those glitches happened because there was something wrong with Lawson’s phone, which he provided himself, rather than something wrong with GrubHub. Lawson said that was a possibility.\nBut O’Shae’s testimony suggests Lawson was not the only driver who experienced ghost orders.\n“Drivers complained about ghost orders all the time,” O’Shae said.\nSo-called ghost orders are a miscommunication between the computer system and the driver’s device, O’Shae said. It results in drivers not noticing that they received a delivery request, which negatively affects their order acceptance rate. And a low acceptance rate means no access to priority scheduling.\nThe reason priority scheduling matters is because Los Angeles, where Lawson drove for GrubHub, “was one of the most competitive markets for shifts that we had,” O’Shae said in her testimony. Drivers would describe the process to get shifts as a “mad scramble,” she added.\nWith these alleged ghost orders affecting the acceptance rate of drivers, Lawson’s lawyer, Shannon Liss-Riordan, believes GrubHub used “ghost orders” to keep drivers “on their toes,” she said earlier in the week. By allegedly keeping drivers on their toes, the drivers would in theory be more inclined to accept every order they received. Liss-Riordan is trying to prove that GrubHub had a certain amount of control over its drivers, which is a primary factor in the Borello test.\nThe Borello test looks at circumstances like whether the work is part of the company’s regular business, the skill required, payment method and whether the work is done under supervision of a manager. The purpose of the test is to determine whether a worker is a 1099 contractor or a W-2 employee.\nI’ll be back in court tomorrow morning to hear testimony from GrubHub COO Stan Chia, who is expected to discuss the part of GrubHub’s business that relates to drivers, and hear some cross-examination of O’Shae.", "tags": "1099-economy,sharing-economy,grubhub-trial,grubhub", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/former-grubhub-employee-testimony-ghost-orders/", "id": "1537294"}, {"title": "HotelTonight to expand booking window to 100 days", "text": "HotelTonight, the platform that lets you make last-minute bookings at hotels, is today announcing that they’re expanding their reservation to up to 100 days out.

Back then the startup was pretty focused on providing users with helpful graphs and charts that could be pulled up by typing in a question like “most points scored by an NFL team this year”.

The company did recording sessions with dozens of NFL players and legends – ranging from Payton Manning to Jerry Rice. These players spent about 90 minutes recording a range of phrases, which StatMuse then strings into complete sentences on the fly when generating a response.  The startup also has players record different verb combinations and styles of the same word, so the algorithm sound more realistic by saying the same thing in a few different ways.\nRight now there are 7 players launching, and the startup hopes to add about one a week going forward.

For general sports inquiries StatMuse enlisted Scott Van Pelt of ESPN, who spend nearly 10 hours recording a much broader catalogue of phrases and player names from the sports world, meaning his voice can respond to basically any question that StatMuse’s database can handle.\nThe technology isn’t perfect – some of the pauses between words are a bit awkward – making it clear that some phrases is being stitched together on the fly. But this is the exception, and on the whole most responses sound pretty good. Sure, GPS services like Waze have already added voice recordings of celebrities, but its a different experience hearing them respond to a question that you ask with your voice.\nThe app is totally free to use, but going forward StatMuse sees a trend towards small dollar consumer subscriptions – meaning they may charge a dollar or two a month to talk to your favorite player.\nYou can check out StatMuse in the iOS App Store now, and on Alexa devices in the next few days.\n", "tags": "nflpa,statmuse", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/statmuse-lets-you-ask-a-sports-question-and-hear-a-response-from-an-nfl-star/", "id": "1537251"}, {"title": "Pendo acquires Insert to add mobile apps to its user analytics and engagement platform", "text": "Pendo helps businesses understand and assist their customers with tools like analytics, polls and walkthroughs. Until now, however, CEO Todd Olson said the company has been focused on the web (both desktop and mobile), with just a single mobile developer on the team.\n“We as a team constantly had a lot of internal debates about how much to invest in [mobile],” he said. “If you want to do it, you have to really invest in it.”\nThat’s why the company has made its first acquisition — it’s buying Insert, a mobile marketing startup based in Israel. Olson told me that he connected with Insert through Battery Ventures, which backed both companies, and he saw their product as doing “essentially what we do, but for mobile devices.”\nThere are some differences, he acknowledged, since Insert is more focused on mobile messaging and less on analytics. But in Olson’s view, the Insert team has already done “all the hard work” of creating a platform that marketers and product designers can use, and integrating that product with native mobile apps.\n“The key is doing it without developers,” he said. So with Insert, Pendo can build a platform that allows teams to engage with customers and improve their product across devices, and to do so without developer assistance: “The vision is to combine the products into one simple platform.”\nPendo recently raised a $25 million Series C, partly to fund acquisitions and international expansion — it looks like the Insert deal covers both. (Insert’s Tel Aviv office will also become Pendo’s first international location.) Insert, meanwhile, raised a $10 million round from Battery last year.\nThe financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Olson said the combined companies have a headcount of 145 employees.\n“With Insert, Pendo acquires a team that shares its passion for great product experiences,” said Insert founder and CEO Shahar Kaminitz in the acquisition announcement. “This combined platform allows product teams to better understand mobile users and deliver personalized experiences on the right mobile moments, when users are likely to get the best value.”", "tags": "battery-ventures,insert,pendo", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/pendo-acquires-insert/", "id": "1537220"}, {"title": "Favor, the on-demand service focused on Texas, picks up $22 million Series B", "text": "The on-demand economy is great for consumers but hard for the companies that provide on-demand services. While many are still struggling to stabilize their business model and optimize their work force, Favor has seemed to find a bit of success by focusing in on a specific region.\nFavor is an on-demand delivery service that operates in Texas. Much like Postmates, the service lets users order food (as well as other stuff) from their favorite restaurants and has runners pick it up and deliver it to the end-user.\nThe company has today announced the close of a $22 million Series B financing round led by existing investor S3 Ventures. Moreover, Favor says that the company has achieved profitability (overall profitability; not unit-economic profitability) as of this year.\nPart of that has to do with the way that Favor has scaled back and focused on growing up a small number of markets.\nFavor came on to the scene at SXSW in 2014, and took the same approach that most on-demand services do, which is to rapidly expand to new markets. However, Favor announced in July 2016 that it would be shuttering service across five major markets — Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC — and shifting focus to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, instead.\nThe plan was to target markets with low density but high population, and it worked for a while. But the company has now drawn back into its home state of Texas, serving 11 markets within the state.\nCEO Jag Bath sees Texas as a great place to learn how to grow up a market. After all, Texas has the second-largest economy of any state in the country, with a GDP greater than that of many countries.\nAs part of the funding deal, Favor is bringing on 25,000 new runners and working out a plan to expand to more markets within Texas. Eventually, Bath tells TechCrunch, the company will proceed outside of the state of Texas, but for now they’re working on making Favor as strong as possible in Texas.\nSpeaking of, Favor has mobilized its workforce to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey, and built out tools offering users the option to donate a care package of relief supplies or make a monetary donation.\nLike most on-demand delivery companies, Favor makes a portion of its revenue from its delivery fee, which it splits with the runner — runners keep 100 percent of their tips. But, beyond that, Favor also has paid partnership deals with businesses and restaurants, taking a percentage of the business they bring in for those partners.\n“Our biggest challenge is to continue to win on service against many competitors who have deeper pockets and raised a lot of funding,” said Bath. “We don’t try to buy customers or runners, but instead try to provide the best possible service. It’s difficult to compete with free food all the time.”\nThat’s a clear dig at Postmates, which frequently uses promotions and discounts to turn up engagement on the platform. Postmates also operates in some of the same markets as Favor in Texas.\nWith this new $22 million, Favor has now raised a total of $34 million.", "tags": "s3-ventures,favor", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/favor-the-on-demand-service-focused-on-texas-picks-up-22-million-series-b/", "id": "1537215"}, {"title": "After scrapping Monsanto deal, Deere agrees to buy precision farming startup Blue River for $305M", "text": "Five months after abandoning its proposed purchase of Monsanto’s precision planting subsidiary due to anti-trust concerns, agricultural equipment giant Deere and Company announced that it will spend $305 million to acquire ag-tech startup Blue River Technology. Founded in 2011 and based in Sunnyvale, Blue River develops machine learning technology for precision farming and counts Monsanto’s venture capital arm, Monsanto Growth Ventures, among its investors.\nAccording to Crunchbase, Blue River raised a total of $30.35 million in funding and its other backers included Data Collective, Pontifax AgTech, Innovation Endeavors and Khosla Ventures.\nPrecision agriculture refers to farming practices that rely on computer vision, machine learning and smart devices to improve yield. It’s attractive to growers because it automates labor-intensive parts of the farming process, allowing them to cut labor costs, and also reduces the waste of pesticides, water and fertilizer.\nPrecision farming is an important part of Deere’s growth strategy and it agreed to buy Precision Planting LLC from Monsanto in November 2015, but gave up on the deal in May after the U.S. Department of Justice filed an anti-trust lawsuit. The Department of Justice claimed that the deal would have been worth about $190 million and that Deere and Precision Planting together would have held at least 86 percent of the high-speed precision planting market.\nMonsanto Growth Ventures participated in Blue River’s $17 million Series B, which was announced in December 2015.\nThough Deere is based in Moline, Illinois, Blue River’s 60-person team will remain in Sunnyvale. The acquisition is expected to be completed next month.\nBlue River’s See & Spray equipment uses computer vision and machine learning to help growers reduce the use of herbicides. Its technology analyzes each plant and refers to an image library to determine if it is a weed. If it is, the See & Spray then sprays herbicide directly onto the offending plant, avoiding the crop or surrounding soil. This distinguishes See & Spray from other computer vision-based weed detection methods that analyze growth patterns and colors in patches of plants and makes it much more precise. Other Blue River machines include the LettuceBot, which automatically culls lettuce plants so the others have enough space to thrive, and remote-sensing drones.\nIn a statement, John May, Deere’s chief information technology officer and president of agricultural solutions, said the company will be able to integrate Blue River’s technology in a wide range of products. “As a leader in precision agriculture, John Deere recognizes the importance of technology to our customers.

Neither Scott, nor her legal counsel, responded to a request for comment for this story. Upload has also released the following statement around the conclusion of the legal case.\n“Our primary focus at Upload is education, which we believe is the key to growing the mixed reality ecosystem. We are deeply committed to creating an inclusive community to empower the pioneers building the future.”\nThe Upload allegations came at the beginning of a tumultuous summer for technology companies as women (inspired, perhaps, by Susan Fowler’s courageous exposure of harassment at Uber) came forward with stories of inappropriate behavior from venture investors and executives.\nIn Upload’s case, some former employees wonder whether the company has failed to show real changes have been made in the aftermath of the suit.\n“From the other cases that happened along the same lines, either with Uber or 500 Startups, something happened with the people that did those things. They stepped down or publicly apologized or they put processes in place or they got HR or they did something,” one former employee told us. “[Upload’s co-founders] said one little quote and then they dragged a settlement case out for long enough that it wasn’t even news anymore.”\nWhen news of the sexual harassment lawsuit broke in early May, Upload employees were waiting to see what the response of the startup’s co-founders would be to some of their former co-worker’s allegations. When Taylor Freeman and Will Mason denied the merit of all of Scott’s allegations in their official statement, four full-time Upload staffers immediately quit.\nWhat followed were days of “radio silence” from the company’s leadership regarding the scandal, former employees told us, and then suddenly an email asking team members not to talk to the press while they “resolve outstanding issues.” According to people familiar with the company’s thinking, the silence was due to ongoing legal discussions, which kept the founders from discussing the matter publicly.\n“When we reflect back on our short history, like any startup, there are things we should have done differently,” Freeman wrote to the startup’s members in an email, obtained by TechCrunch. “But we are also very proud of what we have accomplished, and remain tremendously excited about our future.”\nFreeman and Mason faced internal calls to step down following the controversy, sources tell us.\nIn the weeks following the scandal, key investors distanced themselves from the company and its initial plans to raise a VR/AR-focused venture fund. SEC documents and a since-deleted company web page confirm the startup was looking to raise a $12 million early stage fund for launch in Q3 of this year.\n“The decision to put Upload Ventures, which was in its infancy, on hold was a mutual one reached with our partners in order for us to focus more on our core business units in the short term,” an Upload company spokesperson wrote in a statement.\nIn the months since, the company has looked to move on from the harassment scandal that has engulfed it by hiring new leadership to tackle education and community-building efforts at the company’s SF and LA offices.\nAnne Ahola Ward, the chief executive of Circle Click, has stepped in as the company’s new chief operating officer. The company has also brought in Jacquelyn Morie to head up the company’s education efforts.\nWe received a copy of a blog post that Ward, the company’s incoming COO, posted to the internal Upload site, which attempts to address the aftermath of the lawsuit.\nMeanwhile, the company also hired Morie, a former Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Creative Technologies, who has been working in and around virtual worlds almost since the industry’s inception. She spent 13 years at ICT before launching her own company, All These Worlds, to commercialize her work in virtual and augmented reality.\nMorie is aware of the company’s recent history and troubles, but insists that Upload is ready, willing and able to move on.\n“You can’t judge an entire company on one incident. Whatever that happens to be… unless it is so egregious that the company can’t get beyond it. I don’t think that’s what’s happening here,” Morie told TechCrunch. “I believe that this is a learning opportunity. They will take something that wasn’t working and would try to make it right. If I thought they were not going to address it or deal with and were trying to sweep it under the rug, I wouldn’t be there.”\nNot everyone in the industry is convinced that the company has done enough to address the allegations surrounding it or create a safe space for female entrepreneurs in the VR industry.\n“I do think they are good guys at heart, but I think they were immature and they… fucked up,” one former employee said of the company’s founders.\nWith Scott’s lawsuit finished, Upload does still have a community to reassure.\nOne female founder, who had previously worked with Upload, hopes that women in the VR industry can move to create systems that enable women to talk about their experiences with sexual harassment.\n“There’s no safety network for women to speak up,” she said. Asked if Upload should be the one tackling that problem, the founder said that there would likely be “severe trust issues” with such an initiative. “Maybe Upload’s culture changed, but they didn’t even apologize or give an explanation on what they stand for, and that’s a problem because you don’t want to be associated with people who are in a scandal like this without an explanation,” she said.", "tags": "uploadvr,upload", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/vr-company-upload-settles-sexual-harassment-suit-though-some-still-feel-unsettled/", "id": "1533258"}, {"title": "23andMe hits $1.5B pre-money valuation in latest huge funding round", "text": "Following up on the news of 23andMe’s huge upcoming financing round, TechCrunch has learned that the company is raising the new financing at a $1.5 billion pre-money valuation.

A case study of early-stage funding", "text": "\n\nFor many entrepreneurs, especially first-time founders, raising outside capital can be daunting. Between all of the new vocabulary — like “term sheets,” “capitalization tables,” “pro rata” and different valuation metrics — and the very real legal implications of the agreements being signed, it’s easy to get overwhelmed.\nWhen you’re first starting out (or just need a refresher), it’s often best to learn from examples. So, that’s what we’re going to do today. We’re going to explain the basic mechanics of the first rounds of funding, some of the key terms involved and how different types of financial instruments and deal structures work. Let’s start a company and build a capitalization table! And, for the sake of keeping this accessible, we’re going to try to keep the terms simple.\n(Also note: All companies and funds mentioned in this article are fictitious and presented for the sake of example. Any resemblance to real firms is purely coincidental.)\nLet’s start at the beginning. Imagine two founders, Jack and Jill. Their idea: The Internet of Wings, a buffalo chicken restaurant featuring drone delivery to all of Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\nThey work with a lawyer to set up a corporation. The two decide to split their stakes at a 60-40 ratio, with the majority going to Jill because she’s going to serve as CEO and has the technical background to make the scalable part of the business — drone-based delivery — a reality. They also decide to set aside 20 percent of the shares in an equity pool for future employees. So, here’s how the ownership stakes break down at the start:\nInternet of Wings Inc. (abbreviated IoW, like IoT, but involving poultry) was established as a Delaware C corporation — the standard type of legal entity for venture-backed startups — with 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock outstanding, issued at a par value of $0.001 per share. With this, in the eyes of the law, the company is now valued at $10,000. Here is the capitalization table for the company at this point:\n\nJack sets to work developing a chicken sandwich that appears to be lovingly hand-crafted, even when produced at industrial scale. And he may or may not have taken “inspiration” from Apple’s patented pizza boxes when creating packaging to keep the sandwiches intact and warm, but not soggy, during the short airlift from IoW’s rented kitchen space to the customer. Meanwhile, Jill hacks together a drone capable of flying chicken sandwiches hither and yon.\nAfter months of working nights and weekends, they go to a park — their Kitty Hawk — and successfully make their first flight, which was captured on video and subsequently went viral on Periscope. With demonstrated demand for the novel idea but no cash to cover the costs of the business, Jill determines it’s time to raise some outside capital in a seed round.\nSeed rounds come in two main flavors: priced and unpriced. A priced seed round is much like any other round of funding in that the company is given a valuation, and shares in the company are purchased for cash by investors at a price determined by that valuation.\nBut today, due to their popularity relative to their priced cousins, as well as their unique structures and financial instruments, we’re going to focus on unpriced seed rounds in this section.\nAs the name suggests, in an unpriced round, the company is not given a valuation, and the investor isn’t necessarily purchasing a known amount of equity at the time of investment. Rather, it’s an agreement between the investor and the company to issue shares in a future, priced round in exchange for an infusion of cash at the time the unpriced Seed deal is struck.\nThe two most common financial instruments used in unpriced seed rounds are convertible notes and so-called Simple Agreements for Future Equity (or “SAFE notes”). A convertible note is a financial instrument that is issued first as debt, but then converts to equity under predetermined conditions, such as raising a priced round. A SAFE note is like a convertible note, except it’s not a debt instrument, meaning that SAFE notes don’t carry an obligation to pay interest. Introduced in late 2013 by Y Combinator, the prominent Silicon Valley-based incubator program, SAFE notes are generally thought to be more founder-friendly than convertible notes precisely because they aren’t treated like debt, so they don’t have a maturity date or interest payments associated with them. And as an added point of convenience, the agreements tend to be short, and there are comparatively fewer terms for founders to negotiate.\nBecause seed investors take on a lot of risk by investing in very early-stage companies, they’ll oftentimes add a number of provisions to their investment agreements to ensure they get a sufficiently large piece of the company to justify that risk. Two of the most common provisions in unpriced rounds are “discounts” and “valuation caps.”\nTrue to its name, a discount provision grants investors the right to purchase shares at a discount from the price of shares in the next funding round. In this case, the next round is Series A, which is typically the first priced funding round a company experiences (and the point at which the convertible note or SAFE would convert to shares). Separately, a valuation cap puts a ceiling on the valuation of the company such that the investor can ensure they get a certain percentage share of a company. This helps prevent a runaway valuation from squeezing the percentage share they’d be able to purchase in the company.\nBack to Jack and Jill. They decide to raise capital in an unpriced seed round for their startup. They figure they need to raise $5 million to get their company off the ground. After soliciting introductions from their network, and lots of back and forth, they find two investors eager to commit the entirety of the round.\nOpaque Ventures agrees to a $2.5 million SAFE with a 20 percent discount provision, and BlackBox Capital will invest $2.5 million in a SAFE that has a $10 million valuation cap on the company’s pre-money valuation. Agreements are signed, money is wired to the company’s bank account and Jack and Jill resume the process of building their venture.\nIt’s important to note that at this time no new shares have been created, and the value of the company remains the same because, again, this is an “unpriced” round where no new value is assigned.\nFast-forward 18 months. Business is booming, with a fleet of drones buzzing all around the Bay Area delivering chicken sandwiches to hungry customers. Jill and Jack have marshalled the financial resources from their seed round well, having invested heavily in R&D, a few good engineering hires and a few agreements with drone manufacturers overseas. But despite rapid growth, the company isn’t profitable and only has eight months left before it runs out of cash.\nIt’s time to raise a Series A round. If a company hasn’t already raised a priced round, Series A is typically when the shares of a startup receive their first valuation.\nAmongst venture capitalists and other startup investors, it’s common to hear two types of valuations mentioned: “pre-money” and “post-money.” Put simply, a pre-money valuation is the value of the company prior to (hence “pre-”) the round’s infusion of capital. The post-money valuation is the value of the company after the round is complete, and it’s usually calculated by adding the amount of money raised in the round to the pre-money valuation.\nJack and Jill went to Sand Hill to raise their Series A. They want to raise $7 million. They meet with many, many investors, and ultimately work out a deal with two new firms. One of their previous investors, BlackBox, opted to participate in the round. Here’s the breakdown:\nAnalysts at Cormorant Ventures determine that Internet of Wings Inc. is worth $15 million prior to any investment. This is its “pre-money valuation.” Although it’s tempting to think that the company’s post-money valuation would be $22 million (by summing the pre-money valuation and the amount being raised here) we’ll see that the post-money valuation is actually a bit higher due to the discount and cap provisions used by the seed investors.\nThe final signing of checks and legal paperwork sets off a cascade of conversions and capitalization table adjustments as the company issues new shares to its investors.\nLet’s start with our seed investors whose investments will convert to equity at this stage.\nOpaque Ventures invested $2.5 million in a SAFE with the ability to purchase shares at a 20 percent discount to the pre-money valuation at Series A. The Series A price is $1.50 per share ($15 million pre-money valuation divided by 10 million shares, the number of shares originally created when the firm was incorporated, which we noted earlier), so at a 20 percent discount ($1.20 per share), Opaque Ventures’ $2.5 million investment converts to 2,083,333 shares ($2.5 million divided by $1.20 per share) valued at $3.125 million, a 1.25x multiple on invested capital.\nIn the seed round, BlackBox Capital invested $2.5 million in a SAFE with a valuation cap of $10 million. This allows them to purchase shares at $1.00 per share ($10 million cap / 10 million shares outstanding), resulting in the purchase of 2.5 million shares from their seed investment. At the new $1.50 share price, BlackBox Capital’s seed investment is now valued at $3.75 million, a 1.5x multiple on invested capital.\nAt a Series A stock price of $1.50, Cormorant Ventures purchased 2,666,666 shares with its $4 million investment. Provident Capital purchased 1,333,333 shares with its $2 million investment. And with its $1 million follow-on funding in the Series A round, BlackBox Capital purchases an additional 666,666 shares of Series A stock.\nHere’s how the ownership of the company breaks down after the Series A round. Let’s start first with our capitalization table after the Series A funding round is complete:\n\nThe post-money valuation of the company after raising its Series A round is roughly $28.875 million. Recall our temptation to say the post-money valuation should be $22 million ($15 million pre-money valuation plus $7 million raised in the round), but that would be incorrect in this case.\nClauses like valuation caps and discounts allow investors to purchase shares at a price lower than the prevailing price per share. This increases the number of shares they are able to purchase, and thus results in more shares being created.\nTo further illustrate that, let’s think about what would have happened if IoW’s seed investors didn’t implement caps or discounts. They would have been issued stock at the regular share price of $1.50 and, accordingly, wound up with a smaller percentage of the company. The terms they put into their investment agreements both raised the post-money valuation of the company by generating more shares and served to give these investors a larger chunk of the company than they’d otherwise be entitled to if they purchased shares at the $1.50/share price paid by Series A investors.\nHere’s the percentage breakdown of the company’s different share classes between seed and Series A rounds:\n\nOne of the other important things to note is that, on a percentage basis, Jack, Jill and the employee equity pool’s relative share of the company has decreased on a percentage basis. This is known as dilution. Financially, dilution isn’t really a big deal, because even a shrinking slice of the proverbial pie is still valuable if the size of the pie — the value of the company — continues to grow. For example, although holders of Common Stock own just 52 percent of the company after its Series A round, their collective stake is now valued at $15 million. And so long as share prices continue to increase in subsequent rounds, the value of their stock will continue to increase, as well, even as they continue to be diluted.\n(Down rounds flip the math here, both diluting current shareholders and driving down the value of their stake. More on that in a coming piece.)\nWhere dilution does matter, though, is in the control and voting structure of the company. In most voting agreements, voting power is often tied to the number and type of shares held by a given shareholder; founders and other investors can find themselves outnumbered during key votes as their percentage ownership of the company is diluted. This is the principal reason why many investors include anti-dilution provisions — to maintain their control in a company.\nRaising outside money is one of the more esoteric aspects of being an entrepreneur, but it doesn’t need to be confusing. Although we used relatively simple terms here, we discussed the differences between pre- and post-money valuations, saw how different types of deal terms affect valuation and percentage ownership and explained how raising new rounds of funding can lead to dilution of founders’ and early investors’ stakes in a company over time.\nThings are often considerably messier in the real world, but the underlying mechanics discussed here still hold.\nTop image credit: iStockPhoto / gorodenkoff\nWing-Drone Image: Li-Anne Dias", "tags": "fundraising,early-stage-funding", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/cap-tables-share-structures-valuations-oh-my-a-case-study-of-early-stage-funding/", "id": "1536481"}, {"title": "Tenka Labs raises another $2M to get its kids’ LEGO engineering kits in retailers", "text": "Tenka Labs co-founder John Schuster is no stranger to walking friends through building gadgets using Arduino, an open-source hardware controller — except they might be great software engineers, but not understand the actual circuitry.\nBut Tenka Labs, which builds simple kits that help young students create small gadgets with the use of motors and other bits that connect to legos, is looking to be an even more basic starting point to understanding engineering. Instead of jumping straight into designing a circuit, Tenka Labs makes what are called Circuit Cubes — kits that include lights or motors — that plug into Legos to teach the true basics of engineering. The company said that it has raised an additional $2 million in seed funding, and is also launching in several retailers for the holiday season.\n“Before they go onto designing circuits, we need to get them to understand the basics,” co-founder Nate MacDonald said. “When they can see and understand it, they’re more comfortable to invent. They understand that the wires are making that motor go, and then they can create things like an electric toothbrush. The stores recognize parents are looking for an educational toy. You can see it online, and there’s a wave happening where schools are starting to have maker spaces. They’re changing woodworking shops into engineering labs.”\nBecause the company is essentially producing a toy, getting into retailers is ahead of the holiday season is going to be key. That’s especially true for toys like Circuit Cubes, which are primed to be potential gifts from parents or relatives looking to get kids interested in engineering. That can then kick off the virtuous cycle: kids enjoy it; the parents, teachers, and friends notice it; and then more and more families start buying it.\nStarting off from such a very basic point is one way to get those kids excited about engineering, and get them up to speed, Schuster says. The blocks plug and play: you stick Legos on top of it to build anything from a fully operational medieval castle, which Schuster saw at a camp over the summer, to a part of a doll house. “There’s electronic, physical, mechanical, but they don’t even now that — they just know they’ve made their tank or their ceiling light,” Schuster said.\n“There are electronic, physical, and mechanical parts, but they don’t even realize that — they just know they’ve made their tank or their ceiling light,” Schuster said.\nTenka Labs, which says it is launching in Target, Micro Center, Barnes & Noble (which still exists, apparently), Amazon, and MoMA stores, will certainly face uphill battles. It’s going to have to continue engaging kids and parents, hopefully tapping that same desire that would encourage them to go to Radio Shack and pick up a proto board and motor. It can do that by adding new blocks down the line, but also at some point contend with the idea that the students may be more attracted to littleBits (or graduate into them).\nThe key question for the company — and one that it naturally got from many investors — is whether it will actually be able to spin up the kind of manufacturing it needs in order to get those toys into stores. Schuster spent more than a month abroad to try to figure out the manufacturing, and the company also soft launched it with a program called Steve & Kate’s Summer Camp to gauge demand. One of the children there actually created a sort of pinwheel with the light kit that displayed a stop-motion video of a running horse, which emboldened Schuster and MacDonald even more as they looked to pique the curiosity of kids.\n“We know there were good products but there was nothing fun and playful,” Schuster said. “That’s why we’re here, we’re filling a niche that had a need. These were the three favorite things they wanted to do. They wanted to make flashlights, battle their cars together and make this weird artwork. You can imagine your mom saying, grab me the flashlight, the kid says I’ll make you one.

Liberty Mutual is clearly a key asset thanks to its insurance industry perspective, and this deepens the relationship between the two companies, since Liberty already provides insurance for cars on Turo’s sharing platform.\nSK Holdings has a number of sub-companies, including SK Telecom, with ties to the automotive industry, and they’ve also recently been investing heavily in new mobility brands. These include SoCar, as well as leading short-term car rental services in other Southeast Asian manufacturers like Malaysia. They represent a partner with potentially far-reaching impact for Turo.\n“They have several SK companies that are involved closely with OEMs,” explained Turo CEO Andre Haddad in an interview. “They provide parts and systems for car manufacturers based in Korea, as well as global manufacturers of cars. Recently, they started investing in mobility services. They found that Turo, with our global perspective, and they’re keen on positioning themselves in what they believe is going to be a significant part of how people access, buy, sell and finance cars in the future.”\nHaddad points out that the number of cars on the road is fastest growing in Asia, and he says SK also invested because  they believe they also can help with Turo’s Asia expansion plans in general.\nDaimler’s investment is unique, since it also comes alongside Turo’s acquisition of its Croove business. Croove, which launched in December last year, was a car-sharing business that Daimler fully owned, which launched in Germany initially. It offered a very similar model to Turo, allowing anyone to rent their vehicle on a peer-to-peer basis, and it was open to vehicles of any make and model.\n“We had a lot of interest from a bunch of OEMs in this round, and we had great conversations with a lot of those OEMs,” explained Haddad. “One of the things we particularly liked about Daimler was that they were not just talking the talk, they were walking the walk with their direct investment in incubating and launching Croove. We do believe that our platform Turo and peer-to-peer car sharing is fundamentally going to evolve car ownership and we believe that partnering with an OEM that has already expressed their deep interest and belief in this phenomenon by building their own business with Croove was a differentiator.”\nOnce the investment in Turo by Daimler was agreed upon, Haddad says it made no sense for the automaker to continue to operate its own separate peer-to-peer car sharing business, hence the decision to put Croove in Turo’s hands. As to why it went that way, when a lot of OEMs seem to be going in the other direction and acquiring younger mobility startups, Haddad says it’s about recognition on both sides of how the model works.\n“For peer-to-peer car sharing to be really successful, it needs to be operated within an open platform where anyone can participate,” he said. “We believe very strongly that peer-to-peer marketplaces are only great when they are open and accessible. I think there was mutual recognition of this fundamental nature of peer-to-peer marketplaces, and I believe that’s the reason why Daimler are also very clear on this dynamic.”\nHaddad said the details of how the transition will work in practice are still being worked out, but the plan is not to operate separate brands for long, and to launch Turo in Germany in place of the Croove brand in a matter of “weeks and months,” not years.", "tags": "daimler,turo", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/turo-raises-92m-and-acquires-daimlers-croove-car-sharing-business/", "id": "1536592"}, {"title": "Apple just released iOS 11 beta 10 to developers", "text": "Apple is pushing the limits of its beta program as the company just released the tenth beta version of iOS 11.

While revenue generated by the company’s core wireless business in 2016 was 2.7 per cent down on the year before.\nVerizon is therefore intent on transforming into an “information company” which sells “experiences” on top of connectivity, and looks for ways to “optimize the monetization” — including making use of machine learning and AI, as the company’s EVP and president, Ronan Dunne, put it in comments at a conference last month. (For “optimize the monetization” read: target ads to our existing subscriber-base to ramp up our share of the digital advertising market.)\nIn a promo video for Verizon Up, as the new program is called, the wireless giant claims its motivation for giving customers who sign up for the program one credit (which is good for one reward) for every $300 they spend on their monthly bill — which they can redeem on a variety of offers from Starbucks coffee to TV shows to movie premiers to concert tickets — is “just because you’re with Verizon”. “Because, thanks,” they add.\n\nOf course the truth is rather less one-sided.\nA legal disclaimer on the Verizon Up sign up page notes that only those customers who sign up for Verizon Select are eligible for the rewards program. So what is Verizon Selects? It’s Verizon’s ad-targeting program, which targets marketing based on users’ personal data.\nSo, in plain English, Verizon is saying: let us use your browsing, location, interests and other personal data for marketing purposes — and we’ll let you participate in our earn-rewards program.\nVerizon Selects targets ads based on users’ web browsing, app usage, device location, use of Verizon services and “other information about you (such as your postal/email addresses, demographics, and interests)” — sharing this information with Oath (aka the digital media entity formed after the recent merging of Verizon acquisitions, AOL and Yahoo) in order to power wider ad-targeting of Verizon users across its devices and services.\nThe data is also being used to personalize the rewards individual users see in Verizon Up, the company’s FAQ says.\nThe wider context here is that Oath is Verizon’s bid to better compete for digital ad spend with the personal-data-harvesting ad-targeting specialists of the Internet: aka Google and Facebook.\nRegulation of how telcos can use personal data has typically been tighter than for Internet services but earlier this year the FCC reversed tighter privacy rules for broadband providers — thereby giving giants like Verizon more room for their data-harvesting, ad-tracking manoeuvres.\nInterestingly, Verizon is not auto-enrolling all users in the rewards/data-sharing program — so is evidently taking things a little more cautiously than it could technically, given the current lack of a robust regulatory framework covering U.S. ISP privacy.\nAs TechCrunch wrote in March, when the broadband privacy rules were reversed —\n— with only the potential possibility of the FTC regaining privacy oversight of ISPs in future to provide some pause for thought in how wireless providers go about sucking up and sharing their customers’ data.\nWriting in the Hill in March, at the time of the broadband privacy rule reversal, FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny warned of what she couched as “part of a larger effort to substantially shift the risks of data security from companies to consumers and to weaken consumer privacy choices”.\nEven so, ISPs face the risk of losing customers’ trust if they are perceived to be playing fast and loose with their privacy — so perhaps a sense of needing to balance these sorts of trust issues is feeding into Verizon’s decision to make the program opt-in, as well as wider regulatory considerations.\nOn the latter, earlier this year Verizon agreed to paid a $1.35M fine to the FCC which had been investigating its user of so-called “supercookies” to target ads — and also agreed it would ask users to opt-in before sharing data with third parties. So that penalty is serving as a recent ‘regulatory considerations’ reminder.\nCommenting about the new Verizon Up program to the WSJ, Diego Scotti, Verizon’s chief marketing officer, pointed to tech giants like Google and Facebook, saying: “Some of our competitors, they have exactly the same thing, it’s just buried in the terms and conditions of the service. We are not hiding anything.”\nAlthough there’s still at least a technical difference between an Internet application that people choose to use, like Facebook, and an ISP that provides Internet connectivity, with only limited alternatives for accessing the Internet if someone wants to ditch their ISP (even if lots of web users might feel they cannot easily ditch Facebook or Google, either).\nVerizon users opting to share their personal data with Oath for ad-targeting purposes can withdraw their consent (via logging in to a preferences page) — however an FAQ on the program suggests that users’ data is unlikely to be immediately deleted. “Information used for Verizon Selects while you are a participant may be kept for up to three years,” it states.\n“Information previously collected may continue to be used for analytics and modeling purposes,” the FAQ further notes.\nWe’ve reached out to Verizon with questions and will update this post with any response.", "tags": "broadband,aol,verizon", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/verizons-new-opt-in-rewards-program-requires-users-to-share-personal-data-for-ad-targeting/", "id": "1536588"}, {"title": "Facebook Watch original video tab launches to all U.S. users", "text": "Today Facebook officially opened its new Watch tab of original video content to everyone in the U.S. after a limited rollout a month ago and expansion to some more users last week. Available on Facebook’s native mobile apps, desktop site, and TV apps, Watch lets users subscribe to their favorite series instead of just haphazardly stumbling upon one-off videos in the News Feed. U.S. users will now see the TV icon in the mobile navigation bar and desktop site bookmarks.\nMeanwhile, Facebook is trying to ensure that user generated videos don’t get taken down for including music owned by the major record labels. Bloomberg reports Facebook is offering the labels hundreds of millions of dollars for a deal that would let infringing videos stay up, rather than be removed to the great annoyance of users.\nFacebook had planned to build out a YouTube Content ID-style system so labels could detect uses of their music and claim a cut of monetization from then instead of just issuing blunt takedown notices. But Bloomberg says that system could take up to two years to build, and Facebook is willing to pay now to stop the takedowns.\nFacebook is offering a range of different options for discovering video content, including a carousel of featured programs, and sections like “Today’s Spotlight”, “New This Week”, “Popular Now”, “What Friends Are Watching”, “Most Talked About”, “Suggested For You”, and a special “10 Minutes Or More” spot for long-form videos.\n\nFor now, Facebook is primarily highlighting reality shows, which partners are producing en masse since they’re cheap, don’t require set scripts, and can be watched piece-meal. But to really seduce audiences who frequent YouTube, Netflix, and cable TV, Facebook will need high quality scripted comedies and dramas.\nOne of the first signs of this content is the sci-fi short film ‘Lost Memories’ by independent filmmaker Francois Ferracci about a future “over-saturated by holograms”. Beyond that, its current offering isn’t very appealing, as the shows lack stars, big budgets, or cliff-hangers. But if you’re the type to just turn on the Discovery Channel and lay back on the couch, you might find some fun time-wasters on Facebook Watch.", "tags": "facebook-video,facebook-watch", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facebook-watch-tab/", "id": "1536327"}, {"title": "Facetune maker’s latest app, Quickshot, helps you take better photos", "text": "Lightricks, the company behind the popular selfie-correcting app called Facetune, is adding to its line of mobile photography and editing tools with the recent launch of a new app called Quickshot. Like its other efforts in this space, Quickshot aims to make photo editing more accessible to amateurs. However, in this case, the app’s focus is to assist with taking photos, not just correcting them after the fact.\nThe app’s name references one tool in particular – a “quickshot” mode which will automatically align your photos, fix the lighting and preview filters before you even snap the picture. The idea is that you’ll be able to take better photos if you can see what they’ll look like before you press the capture button.\nOther modes include the “strobe” mode that lets you capture action and movement by mimicking strobe lights and long exposures, and an “HDR” mode that helps with tricky lighting situations.\n\nBeyond these different camera modes, the app also ships with a range of adjustable presets for various scenes, like portraits, nature, urban, and more. That way, novice photographers don’t have to fiddle with various settings to take the best photo, while more advanced users can load a preset then tweak it further to their liking.\n\nThe ability to customize your filter in order to give your photos a unique, personalized look is something that draws people to other top photo apps, like Instagram, Snapseed, and VSCO, for example. But with Quickshot, the larger idea is to combine favorite tools like photo filters with Lightricks’ understanding of making photo edits easier through tricks like instant fixes and other tools that can speed up the process.\nFor example, Quickshot’s batch editor that lets you adjust a single style – like the filter, brightness, depth and more – and then apply it multiple images all at once.\n\nQuickshot is the latest app in a growing lineup of apps from Lightricks, which has been aiming to capitalize on its success with Facetune to launch a subscription business for its creativity tools. Earlier this summer, it debuted a new photo editor called Enlight Photofox, which is basically the upgraded version of the existing Enlight app.\nIt’s still somewhat rare to see this strategy play out on today’s App Store. Developers are often expected to roll out new features as upgrades to existing apps, not as new ones. Tweetbot, a Twitter client, has been one exception to this rule, which applies more so to apps than games. It’s far more common for sequels to arrive as their own standalone games, as with Monument 2, for instance.\nLike Enlight Photofox and Facetune 2, Quickshot is also a subscription offering. While the app itself is free, an “unlimited access subscription” offers all the app’s features and content, for either $1.99 per month, $0.83 per month if you pay for a year upfront, or $19.99 for life.\nBecause of this model, Quickshot is getting slammed in the App Store reviews from those who feel like it doesn’t offer enough features to justify this pricing. The app currently has a 2.3-star rating (out of 5). This, unfortunately, speaks to a larger problem with the App Store’s business model – developers who believe their work is worth paying for are penalized because there are so many free alternatives available they have to compete against, and because the App Store has propagated the belief that because apps are small, they should cost less than desktop software.\nLightricks, before the shift to subscriptions, sold a healthy 11 million paid downloads of its apps. But despite the pushback from users about subscriptions, the company claims they’ve enabled it to increase revenues.\n“Regarding the pivot to subscription model we can definitely confirm that there has a been a significant uptick in revenue run rates,” says Itai Tsiddon, Lightricks co-founder. “However, at this time, we are not yet disclosing specific numbers,” he says, adding that the company will release more details around the end of year.", "tags": "photography,photos,apps,lightricks", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/facetune-makers-latest-app-quickshot-helps-you-take-better-photos/", "id": "1536148"}, {"title": "WhatsApp announces free Business app, will charge big enterprises", "text": "WhatsApp is gearing up to finally monetize its messaging app by charging large enterprise businesses for tools to better communicate with customers. WhatsApp will also offer a free app to small-to-medium sized businesses, though it hasn’t outlined the specific functionality of the app. The enterprise solution will allow global companies “to provide customers with useful notifications like flight times, delivery confirmations, and other updates”.\n“We do intend on charging businesses in the future,” WhatsApp’s Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema told the Wall Street Journal. “We don’t have the details of monetization figured out.”\nThe company did write that it wants to facilitate “someone placing an order with a local bakery or looking at new styles from a clothing store” and “shopkeepers who use WhatsApp to stay in touch with hundreds of customers from a single smartphone”, plus offer “an easier way to respond to messages.”\nPerhaps WhatsApp could charge enterprises like “airlines, e-commerce sites, and banks” to have multiple representatives managing an account or sending high volumes of messages. It could also charge for artificial intelligence bot functionality or ecommerce transactions.\nWhatsApp also officially announced its closed pilot program for verifying business accounts with a green checkmark to distinguish them from personal accounts and fakes.\nWhatsApp began testing verified accounts for businesses a week ago. Conversations with businesses are encrypted and they can be blocked. Interestingly, if a business isn’t already in your phone number contacts, its name will appear as whatever they register themselves as instead of their number. This could allow WhatsApp to create a business search engine with optional sponsored results, or let businesses cold-message people, possibly for a fee.\nAlternatively, businesses on WhatsApp may need to be contacted by a user first before they can respond with organic or sponsored messages. That’s how Facebook Messenger works, and it’s led to businesses buying “tap-to-message” ads on Facebook’s News Feed to get people to initiate conversations so the business can follow up with sponsored messages. Not allowing cold-message ads meshes with WhatsApp writing that it plans to “make it easier for people to communicate with the businesses they want to reach on WhatsApp”, emphasis mine.\n[Update: WhatsApp now confirms our hunch, telling TechCrunch “Businesses will only be able to contact people who have provided their phone number and agreed to be contacted by the business over WhatsApp.”\nThe company also says that the enterprise solution will initially be free but it does plan to charge businesses. Some functionality that will be offered by the Business app and enterprise solution includes the ability to create a verified profile with info like address, description, and hours, plus “Features for helping manage customer chats like away messages for when businesses are not able to respond at the moment.”]\nWhen Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, the companies said they wouldn’t put ads in WhatsApp because it would degrade the experience. But it also ditched its $1 annual subscription fee, leaving few monetization options beyond charging businesses for tools. The introduction of display ads and sponsored messages to Facebook Messenger may indicate a relaxation of WhatsApp’s stance against ads.\nWith over 1.3 billion monthly users and 1 billion daily users, WhatsApp has reached the massive scale necessary for it to earn significant revenue even from light advertising. Its Snapchat Stories clone WhatsApp Status now has 250 million daily users, and could host vertical video ads between friends’ content the way Instagram does. It could also insert display ads into the inbox like Facebook Messenger.\nAfter being one of tech’s biggest startup acquisitions, WhatsApp has tripled in size under relatively hands-off management by Facebook. Now it’s time to earn its keep.\nNote: Article updated to include a link to the Wall Street Journal story", "tags": "facebook-messenger", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/whatsapp-business-app/", "id": "1536154"}, {"title": "Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 excels as a premium productivity smartphone", "text": "Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 launches with more baggage than have previous smartphones in the lineup: Its predecessor’s recall problems ended up killing the phone entirely in most markets.

This version of it, as I said before, seems like it takes the big display concept from outlier specialist hardware to mainstream mainstay; in practice, that’s exactly what it’s done after a week or so of testing.\nI use big screen phones for practical reasons – the large displays are useful if I’m ever in a pinch and need to do some photo editing or article writing on the fly, and they’re also great for consuming content, including both text and video. But if I was picking a phone based on preferred ergonomics and design alone, I’d opt for a smaller device every time (which is why I enjoy the Essential Phone so much).\n\nThe Note 8 is the best balance out there right now between an extremely generous display size, and a device that actually fits the descriptor “mobile.” Its 6.3-inch display gives you a long, gorgeous column for easily gobbling down long sections of text, and it’s a stunning device for viewing photos or videos. Samsung’s video enhancer also works wonders here, bumping up brightness, contrast and saturation to make video content, including Netflix HDR, especially pop automatically when you use those apps or view videos on the web.\nIn terms of footprint, the Note 8 isn’t that far off from the iPhone 7 Plus, and is in fact narrower (though also slightly taller). It’s the same size in terms of how it feels in the pocket, however, and perhaps a bit more manageable in the hand (though reaching for that top left corner will still be a stretch).\nWhen you add the S Pen into the mix with the Galaxy Note 8, which ships with the phone and is spring-loaded in the bottom left corner, and so always easy to access, what the Note 8 becomes is the ultimate productivity smartphone. It’s the easy choice for anyone who wants to get their work done on the go, but who generally sticks to a phone above all else, which these days includes a lot of execs and busy business travellers.\n\nThe Note 8 is also an appealing choice for creatives and artists, since the S Pen actually performs incredibly well when used with apps like Autodesk’s Sketchbook and ArtFlow, displaying impressive performance in terms of both latency and pressure sensitivity. If you’re the type of person who likes to have a pocket notebook or sketchbook handy, the Note 8 is also for you.\nCombined with the camera system, which offers industry leading performance in my opinion in terms of both its artificial depth of field effects and general snappiness, the Note 8 is no longer an outlier device – it feels like the true Samsung flagship, and a vision of productivity done right in the age of mobile device dominance.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/samsungs-galaxy-note-8-excels-as-a-premium-productivity-smartphone/", "id": "1536016"}, {"title": "Xiaomi’s first phone running stock Android looks impressive and costs less than $250", "text": "Xiaomi’s newest flagship smartphone will launch the day before the next iPhone, but Chinese firm has offered another new arrival before that date — and it marks a departure from the usual.

It’s also the first device to go on sale without running Xiaomi’s own MIUI software — and it is in line to get Android Oreo before the end of 2017.\nThat should already be enough to get your attention… and then there’s the price.\nThe Mi A1 is priced around the $230 mark and a wide global release is planned. Xiaomi said the phone is slated for sale in 40 countries worldwide, some of which include Indonesia, Vietnam, Russia, Poland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ukraine and Mexico. Notably, though, the U.S. and UK are not on the list.\nFirst up, the phone will be available in India from September 12. Timing for other launches has not been communicated yet.\n\nBeyond the Android One selling point, the 5.5-inch Mi A1 sports a dual-lens 12 megapixel rear camera and five megapixel front camera. That rear camera arrangement includes wide angle and telephoto lenses to give more advanced photography options — and, yes, the bokeh effect. It’s something we’ve seen in high-end devices like the iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Xiaomi’s own Mi 6 flagship, and that makes its inclusion pretty unique for a phone in the sub-$300 range.\nHe’s an interesting tidbit [hat tip Mashable], Xiaomi is for once not being shy in inviting comparisons to the iPhone. One big difference is obviously the price, with the iPhone 7 Plus costing upwards of $649.\nIt’s worth noting that despite being Android One, Xiaomi has opted for its own camera app over the Google alternative. A small detail, but one that prospective customers may have strong opinions on — or not.\nThe device is basically an international version of the Mi 5X which launched in China earlier this month. Elsewhere, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor running the show, with 4 GB RAM, 64 GB of internal storage and a 3080 mAh battery.\nThere’s supports for USB-C, there’s a fingerprint scanner on the reverse and it will be available in a choice of Black, Gold and Rose Gold.\n\nAll in all, this looks like an impressive Android One device.\nGoogle has put a focus on making Android One more appealing than before — phones released since 2014 have been stuck with a ‘budget’ label — and getting Xiaomi’s brand to be a part is bound to help.\nGoogle certainly seems pleased at the collaboration. It called the device “great example” of what the Android One program can produce.\nProof is in the pudding, of course, and we are yet to get our hands on the Mi A1 to give you some insight into how it performs in the real world. If nothing else, it will be novel to see a Xiaomi phone that doesn’t run the company’s MIUI software, which is used by over 200 million people.\n", "tags": "ios,technology,smartphones,computing", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/xiaomi-android-one-mi-a1/", "id": "1535964"}, {"title": "GetAccept raises $1.6M to help companies close sales leads faster", "text": "GetAccept co-founder Mathias Thulin is very familiar with a common problem sales representatives have: they have a great meeting with a potential customer, fire off an email to follow up on that deal and send a thank you note, and then hear nothing back.\nWith all these leads going dark, Thulin and his co-founder Samir Smajic wanted to dig into the data to figure out what was happening. To do that, they decided to start GetAccept, an e-signature service that helps representatives track their documents and help close those deals. The start-up today said that it has raised $1.6 million in a seed funding round from Amino Capital and Y Combinator, as well as other angel investors. GetAccept came out of Y Combinator in 2016.\n“Too many times you had a great meeting that you just said, ah I love this, send me a proposal and I will talk with my manager and get back to you next week,” Thulin said. “Then, they just go dark. There are much more decision-makers involved that they tell you about, and also that it’s so hard to understand how engaged they actually are. You don’t know what’s happening after you sent the proposal. It’s so easy to ignore your inbox and phone when you try to follow-up with a sales rep.”\nInternally, GetAccept analyses a sales representative’s behavior to see why they are closing on more deals, or vice versa. It looks for cues, like a sales representative including a product demo or the company connecting directly through a chat bot that then connects them directly to another representative. These sales representatives can also lean on retargeting, chasing their leads across platforms in order to build that awareness. Thulin argues that it’s all these light touches that can help companies close that deal, but often times they just go overlooked.\n\nHe also likes to say that his startup is based on artificial intelligence — though you won’t find it at the deep, complex level of a convolutional neural network. But there is certainly some learning happening in the background, with algorithms studying the behavior of the best sales people and the trick and quirks they have that are helping them close better sales leads. It’s not some kind of hardcore AI that would come out of a lab at Stanford, but this kind of self-reflecting software is a hallmark of many emerging enterprise sales startups that look to help businesses streamline their processes.\n“If we could find the triggers that could help push the deal forward, we would do it,” Smajic said. “We see that it’s really for different reasons why sales reps can push the lead forward. If [potential customers] don’t open the document in 24 hours, then we definitely need to address it. We also see another case that if they forward it to other people [in the organization] that the deal will be postponed because there are people involved. We figured out we couldn’t use generic tools, and that was the reason.”\nGetAccept, with this seed funding, still faces an uphill battle against e-signature companies like DocuSign and lead tracking from existing lead-tracking CRM start-ups like Gong or Attach. Those are two very significant markets, though Smajic says that by targeting a product that does both of them will help them outmaneuver the companies that look to eventually dig into each others’ territories. Getting there first will help, though it remains to be seen if they will be able to get the kind of widespread adoption that these companies have already built up.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/getaccept-raises-1-6m-to-help-companies-close-sales-leads-faster/", "id": "1535201"}, {"title": "Designed for iPhone 8, Weather Atlas is a great replacement for your stock weather app", "text": "There’s no shortage of weather apps on the market, but you may have noticed that few of them are actually all that good. That’s where a new entry called Weather Atlas, from the developer behind the popular productivity app Launch Center Pro, comes in. This newly launched weather application aims to be a better alternative to the stock weather app, offering a more modern take on weather apps, as well as a design that’s ready for the new, taller screen expected in the upcoming iPhone 8.\nAccording to Weather Atlas creator, David Barnard, the app includes bottom-focused navigation modeled after Apple’s Maps app, as well as a stacked maps and forecast that will take advantage of the extra space provided by the iPhone 8’s extra vertical space.\n“Weather Atlas started as an update to my old weather app, Perfect Weather,” he explains. “I built Perfect Weather in 2013 because there were no apps at the time that showed a glanceable view of both the forecasts and weather maps,” Barnard continues. “Living in Texas where storms can pop up randomly or blow through from the north or south, I like to take a quick look at the radar even if there’s no rain forecasted in my immediate area.”\n“In 2017 there are now a few weather apps that do show both the forecast and weather maps in the same view, but none of them do it well,” he adds.\n\nPlus, he notes that even though the weather app market is crowded, these apps see high usage, which makes the idea to enter the space still compelling.\nI have to agree that many of today’s top weather apps are starting a feel a bit dated.\nYahoo’s entry in the space years ago was then heralded as a surprisingly attractive creation with its heavy focus on visuals, but its big in-app advertisements have since limited its appeal. Meanwhile, other highly ranked apps like those from The Weather Channel, Weather Underground, AccuWeather, WeatherBug and others perform their utilitarian tasks as promised, but their designs feel a little less-than-current.\nThen there’s that small matter of how AccuWeather was sending users’ location data to a third party, which recently led many users to dump the app from their iPhone. (If that’s a concern for you, Weather Atlas is a good replacement because it doesn’t require your location to work. There are ways to use it without providing access to your personal data. And if you do share location data, it’s not sold or shared with ad networks.)\nAt launch, the new app includes a 10-day forecast; but unlike some weather apps, this forecast also includes hourly breakdowns for all ten days – just keeping scrolling on the hourly forecast screen to see the later days.\nThe mapping component in the app will display radar and cloud layers, as well as temperature, humidity, and precipitation accumulation – layers that aren’t that aren’t as standard elsewhere.\nThe app also supports warning layers for things like thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and tropical tracks – the latter being especially timely given how Hurricane Irma is now getting cooked up out in the Atlantic.\nPlus, Weather Atlas takes advantage of another newer iOS feature, as well – it lets you choose your preferred app icon for your homescreen from a broad selection. Though support for customizable icons were launched earlier this year with iOS 10.3, it’s  still not too common these days to see apps offering this feature. Outside of MLB at Bat and NHL’s apps, we haven’t seen broad adoption from the developer community.\nYou can even change the weather icons within the app to match your preferred style. A Notification Center widget is included, too, if that’s where you prefer to check the forecast.\nOn iPad, the app leverages Apple’s latest technologies like Split View.\nThe app, at launch, provides most of the basics you’d need, but will be updated with support for other features in future releases like push notifications. However, the plan is not to overwhelm users’ with too much data like “some of the nerdier weather apps” do, as Barnard puts it.\nThe app is a free download and is ad-supported, but you can remove ads by paying a $4.99 annual subscription, or $0.49 per month.\nThis “Pro” subscription allows you to support the app’s maker, and gain access to other features including some of those mentioned above, like the customizable icons; warning layers on the maps; additional weather layers like Temperature, Humidity, and Precipitation Accumulation; and Hourly and Daily widgets. (The Current Conditions widget is free though.)\nSubscriptions for weather apps is now a fairly common practice – The Weather Channel, for example, lets you block ads by subscription. Not everyone wants to pay, of course, which is why Weather Atlas still works well without the upgrade. (But I have to say the ads are pretty distracting…it’s worth paying to remove them.)\nHowever, since its launch yesterday, around 7 percent of those who downloaded the app subscribed. That’s closer to 10 percent, if you only count those who launched the app and checked it out, notes Barnard.\nWeather Atlas is available for the U.S. only in the App Store. Other countries may be supported in the future.\n ", "tags": "weather-app,mobile,apps", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/designed-for-iphone-8-weather-atlas-is-a-great-replacement-for-your-stock-weather-app/", "id": "1535180"}, {"title": "Google’s Search app on iOS gets a Twitter-like Trends feature, faster Instant Answers", "text": "Google’s search app on iOS is adding a Trending Searches feature, similar to Twitter or Facebook’s Trends, with an update that rolled out later in the day on Thursday. According to the app’s added “What’s New” text on the App Store, Google will now show you searches that are “trending around you” when you tap into the search box to start a search. It’s also showing Instant Answers as you type, meaning you can ask questions or get quick information before you even press the search button.\nIf the Trending Searches feature sounds familiar, that’s because the feature was rolled out last year on Android, where it was quickly met with a huge influx of user complaints. In fact, one thread on the Google Search product forum was filled with some 500 posts from people who hated the feature and wanted to turn it off.\nPeople had then said they found the feature annoying and distracting, especially because it wasn’t content they were personally interested in – it reflected what the masses on Google were searching. Wrote one person at the time, “I have never searched for Captain America or Manchester United football. Please disable asap.”\nA few months later, Google responded to this feedback with an update that implemented an opt-out Setting in the Google Search app.\n\nWith the updated app on the App Store, it seems that Trending is again making its way to mobile users. And yes, there’s an opt-out option included.\nNow, the Trending Searches have blue, rounded ‘climbing arrow’ icons next to them, which makes these trends easier to differentiate from your own search history, as compared with the gray icons on a white background when the feature first launched last year.\nThough the update claims the Trends are related to what’s happening around you, they don’t seem to be all that local. Instead, today’s list points to general U.S. trends, like the upcoming iPhone event, Big Brother spoilers, and Starbucks Pumpkin Spice latté, among other things. (Wow, that’s America in a nutshell, huh?)\nIn addition, the search feature itself has gotten a little smarter, as it can now answer questions as you type out your search query – even if you typo.\n\nFor example, Google suggests, if you typed “goog stock” or “how tall is the Eiffel Tower,” the answer would appear in the suggestions below the search box. This data comes from Google’s Knowledge Graph – its database of facts sourced from places like Wikipedia and the CIA World Factbook.\nThese updates follow a more recent, major change to Google’s app, which introduced “the feed,” Google’s own, algorithmically crafted news stream focused on your interests.\nThe updated Google Search app is live on the App Store now.", "tags": "mobile,app,search", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/googles-search-app-on-ios-gets-a-twitter-like-trends-feature-faster-instant-answers/", "id": "1535148"}, {"title": "Microsoft’s new Mixer Create app lets you live stream games from your phone", "text": "Microsoft’s mobile game streaming app Mixer Create is launching out of beta testing today on iOS and Android, allowing gamers to broadcast the games they’re playing right from their phone. This feature works on Android with all games, but is more limited on iOS. On iPhone, select games that have enabled Apple’s ReplayKit functionality will work, the company notes.\nThat means games like Star Trek Timelines, Goat Simulator, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, and others will be supported.\nThe app can also be used for co-streaming, which allows up to four streamers to combine their streams into a single viewing experience, Microsoft says in its announcement. In the new app, there’s now an invitations feature that’s partially functional for now. Currently, you can accept or reject the pop-up co-stream invites, but in a few months, you’ll be able to send out these co-stream invites as well.\nGamers can also use the app for non-gaming related purposes, too – like vlogging through a feature that lets them ‘go live’ at any time to initiate a real-time broadcast to their fans.\nPlus, streamers can interact with viewers in their channel’s chat interface when broadcasting, as they could on PC or Xbox.\nThis includes access to moderation tools as well. Some gamers may choose to use the Mixer Create app for chat, while streaming from their computer or console, Microsoft suggests.\nThe launch comes shortly after rival Twitch debuted an updated streaming app of its own, which included the ability to live stream from mobile devices to their channels. Like Microsoft, Twitch is also working to expand beyond gaming to allow its streamers to broadcast other content, including personal updates and other artistic endeavours.\nWhile Microsoft has some features gamers want, its traction in the streaming market still lags behind both Twitch and YouTube in terms of reach. According to a recent study by Streamlabs, Twitch has a much larger chunk of the streaming market, ahead of YouTube in second place. Microsoft, Periscope and Facebook Live had only slivers.\n\nHowever, Mixer (a startup that won TechCrunch Disrupt last year, when it was then called Beam), is still a relatively new entry to this market, and could catch up in time, or at least increase its share.\nMixer Create is live now on both Android and iOS.", "tags": "streaming,gaming,mixer", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/microsofts-new-mixer-create-app-lets-you-live-stream-games-from-your-phone/", "id": "1534615"}, {"title": "Disruptor Beam’s ‘Walking Dead: March to War’ puts you in the middle of a zombified Washington, D.C.", "text": "Disruptor Beam has already created games based on Star Trek and Game of Thrones. Next up is The Walking Dead, with the launch of The Walking Dead: March to War.\nTo build the game, which was first announced last year, the company partnered with Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment. That means the game is technically an adaptation of the comics, but the environments and challenges should feel pretty familiar to TV fans, too.\nNot that this is the first mobile game to adapt the ubiquitous zombie franchise — Telltale has released multiple, critically acclaimed Walking Dead adventure titles, while Scopely’s got The Walking Dead: Road to Survival.\nStill, I was quite impressed by what Disruptor Beam CEO Jon Radoff demonstrated for me. March to War takes place in the same zombie-overrun United States as the comics — in this case, Washington, D.C.\nThe team created what Radoff said is a 20-square-mile map of the city. In other words, it’s a big map, but it also has lots of detail, allowing you to recognize landmarks like the White House, and even to spot individual walkers (a.k.a. zombies) moving across the landscape.\n\nYou can also interact with characters from the comics like Rick and Negan by adding them to your council, where they’ll advise you on your next move.\nAnd as in the comics, the walkers provide a threat, but the bigger danger comes from other humans. March to War is a multiplayer experience that allows you to form alliances with other players (you’ll have a pretty tough time trying to survive on your own, Radoff said), and then launch raids and attacks on other communities.\nThe Walking Dead: March to War is available for free on iOS and Android. Radoff said the launch reflects the same philosophy that Disruptor Beam used with Game of Thrones Ascent and Star Trek Timelines — the goal is to win over the most passionate fans of the franchise, and then expand outward from there.\nRadoff said this is also happening as the owners of popular entertainment franchises increasingly see games as a way to stay connected to fans, not just to make a quick buck.\n“Nothing engages an audience like a long-running game,” he said. “What we build are MMOs that are fundamentally designed to engage people for many, many years.”", "tags": "zombies,the-walking-dead,the-walking-dead-march-to-war,disruptor-beam", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/disruptor-beams-walking-dead-march-to-war-puts-players-in-the-middle-of-a-zombified-washington-d-c/", "id": "1534397"}, {"title": "Echo’s messaging service may add support for SMS texts from your own ‘Alexa number’", "text": "Amazon appears to be planning an expansion of Alexa’s existing messaging capabilities to support sending SMS text messages to friends using your Echo device or Alexa app. That means Echo users could then text anyone using voice commands, not only other Echo owners.\nAccording to code found in the Amazon Alexa app, there are references to a new type of phone number – referred to as your “Alexa number” – which is listed alongside other contact information, like a home phone number, work phone, and mobile. Additionally, references in the code specifically state that users will be able to “send and receive SMS text messages” from their Echo device or the Alexa app.\nNews of SMS messaging was first spotted by the site Voicebot.ai, citing an unnamed source.\nIn a screenshot of code they’ve now added to their original report from last week, you can see lines that reference this so-called “Alexa number,” and further details about how this feature works.\n\nImage credit: Voicebot.ai\nFor example, the code includes references like “My Alexa number is:” and “When you send messages, your contacts will receive them from this number.” \nIt also says “Send and receive SMS text messages using Echo, Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, and the Alexa app,” and offers an example of how to use the feature.\nIt says you can use voice commands like “Alexa, message Jane” and another to check the messages you’ve received. (These commands work today, but don’t extend to SMS.)\nAssuming this is something in active development, rather than placeholder code of some kind, this new feature would go beyond the existing Alexa calling and messaging options that launched in May.\nCurrently, Echo owners can place free voice calls and send text messages using a supported Echo device or the Alexa companion app on their smartphone. However, this feature is limited because the only people you can call or text are those who also have the Alexa app and an Echo, Echo Dot, or Echo Show.\n\nToday, for instance, you can tell Alexa to “message Jane,” but Jane won’t get an SMS text from you, in that case. She has to read it in her Alexa app, or ask Echo to check her messages. If the code above actually does what it promises, then that would change when this feature goes live. Jane would then get a SMS text sent from your “Alexa number.”\nAt present, the existing messaging feature requires you upload your phone contacts to your Alexa app to get started. This led to some privacy issues at launch – users could message you, call or send voice messages to you as long as they had your phone number and the Alexa app installed.\nAmazon, in a response to backlash about this problem, rolled out a contact blocking setting shortly after the feature debuted.\n\nAbove: Amazon’s website detailing the feature as it works today\nAn “Alexa number” could come into play here as another means of protecting user privacy.\nYou could give out your “Alexa number” to those you want to be able text or call you through Echo and the Alexa platform, when you don’t feel comfortable enough to give them your “real” phone number.\nThen you could use Alexa voice commands to send actual SMS texts to those recipients, or you could type your texts in the Alexa app.\nThis is a similar value proposition offered by competing voice services, like Google Voice or Skype, for example, as well as apps that offer you temporary and virtual phone numbers, like Burner.\nBeyond the screenshot from Voicebot’s report above, there are other references to this “Alexa number” that can be found in the Alexa Android app (the APK file)’s code.\n\nAbove and below: code showing an “Alexa” phone number type\n\nHere, you’ll see this “Alexa number” is listed as one of the phone number types a user can have on file in addition to others, like a home phone, work phone, mobile, and “other” – all standard contact fields. The Alexa number field in this APK contains an actual phone number with an area code, which hints that Amazon may assign a virtual number to Echo owners.\nAmazon already has a solution to do this, Voicebot had pointed out – AWS’ Simple Notification Service (SNS) is often used by businesses who want to send broadcast SMS messages to their customers, among other things.\nAnother interesting tidbit is that a reference in the code (see the first image) also says that “Messaging is available for free for a limited time.”  \nThat could mean that being able to send SMS texts is something Amazon is considering rolling out as a paid upgrade. That would be notable, if true, as Amazon isn’t really monetizing Echo right now beyond the cost of selling the hardware itself, and from those consumers who use its voice shopping features.\nOf course, finding code references doesn’t always mean that a feature is in active development or on the near-term roadmap. But there’s quite a lot of code here to dismiss this as being placeholder text, written “just in case” Amazon’s decides to go that route.\nIn addition, it seems clear that Amazon is highly interested in the potential for Echo to become a communication device. It launched the Echo Show, which has a disruptive new way to stay in touch called “Drop In,” where you literally just pop up on a friend or family member’s video screen.\nPlus, the Alexa app today defaults to the “Conversations” screen, instead of the app’s actual “Home” screen – something meant to encourage adoption of the messaging service.\nReached for comment about Alexa’s planned SMS texting feature, an Amazon spokesperson only said “per company policy, we don’t comment on rumors or speculation.”\nKnow more?

A Swiss startup brings the, in retrospect, obvious solution of augmented reality to the problem, giving patients a virtual view of the smile they could soon have.\nThe company, Kapanu, is a spin-off of Swiss technical university ETH Zurich; CEO Roland Mörzinger and his team created an augmented reality engine for medical purposes, and dentistry was chosen as a good first application.

Once the software locks onto the user’s mouth and teeth, it overlays the improved teeth — and that’s where the fun starts. There are options the user can then tweak: how close the teeth are, various shapes and spacing and so on. All the changes are visible live.\n\nOnce the patient has customized their teeth and given them a preview in the AR “virtual mirror,” the final model is sent off for manufacture wherever it is replacement teeth are made.\nThe system was shown at the International Dental Show in Cologne last winter, and apparently they were mobbed. It clearly impressed the big players in this corner of the health world: this June Kapanu was acquired by Ivoclar Vivadent.

Allbirds currently manufactures the product in South Korea, with material sourcing coming from what I’m told is the same mill Armani uses in Italy to make its wool suits.\nBrown played it coy when asked which new materials he was looking at but did add that, as great as he thought wool was, it had its limits.\n“We’re focused on the idea of comfort and comfort is different when it’s raining, when it’s snowing. Comfort is different when it’s 110 degrees and you’re wearing wool,” Brown told TechCrunch. “Wool is a miracle material but there’s other materials that do other things.”\nThe startup is also planning to push into physical retail. Allbird’s current model is direct-to-consumer, selling shoes from its website. But, much like Tiger Global’s other bet, Warby Parker, the plan is to expand into brick-and-mortar.\nAllbirds already started the physical process, selling out of its first retail location in a 500-square-foot downtown San Francisco retail space it calls “Allbirds on Hotaling.” It now plans to scout for a second store location in a yet-to-be-announced city.\nA company spokesperson couldn’t give me the foot traffic or sales for San Francisco store but did say it was “doing better than expected.”\nAllbirds, which come in several styles and colors for both men and women and sell for $95 a pair, aims to replicate the success elsewhere.

The figure is a widely-recognized placeholder number. The company could raise more or less in its IPO.\nFollow Crunchbase News on Twitter & Facebook\nAs a private company, Roku raised more than $200 million.\nThe firm, whose IPO was widely anticipated at a valuation around $1 billion, is set to test the market’s waters when indices trade near record highs, video reigns supreme in the media landscape, and some tech offerings have done well. Others have struggled.\nBefore the weekend impends, let’s slice through how Roku makes money, how much money it makes, and what to make of it all.\nRoku sells TV-focused streaming hardware to consumers, and it also works with content players to get their material in front of consumers. It also has an ad business. The latter two efforts fall under what Roku calls “platform revenue.”\nThe company’s mix of top-line sources is described in its S-1 in the following fashion:\nOver time, Roku has increased the percent of its total revenue that comes from its platform business. In practice, it looks like this (via Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research):\n\nAs we’ll see shortly, the mix shift in Roku’s revenue matters as one of the two sources has a far higher gross margin.\nDriving the change, it seems, is that Roku drives more usage of its streaming service through partnered-hardware (TVs that run its software) instead of selling hardware over time. This means it can still drive new, active users and engaged hours while not being beholden to selling low-margin hardware.:\n\n\n \nSo Roku sells hardware for its streaming service, partners with TV manufacturers to sell Rock-powered hardware, drives revenue from partnered streaming companies, and sells ads.\nSimple enough, really. How big is Roku? Let’s find out.\nBefore we dive into the guts of the company, here are the big numbers.\nThe following chart from Roku’s S-1 shows its 2016 and 2015 fiscal years, and the results of the first half of 2017 compared to the first half of 2016 (calendar). Bear in mind that everything is in units of thousands, so a result of “$119,116” means $119,116,000. Let’s go:\n\nThe company’s revenue is expanding while its net losses fall thus far in 2017. The firm’s growth in the 2017 fiscal year came with slightly increased losses.\nRoku grew 23 percent in the first two quarters of calendar 2017 compared to the year-ago period. That’s partially due to the company changing up how it brings in revenue. As such, the soft 23 percent figure is more nuanced than it might seem.\nThe above-mentioned revenue mix shift makes Roku’s revenue a bit harder to track than it otherwise might be. The firm posted sequential-quarter declines in hardware sales, for example, from the first quarter of this to the second. And, in the second quarter, the firm also posted year-over-year declines in hardware income.\nSuffice it to say that the company’s hardware business is in decline. Its platform revenue has grown consistently, however. Going back a few quarters (calendar), here are its results:\n\nAs you can see, that is steady revenue growth from Roku’s platform business, aside from the slight Q4 to Q1 dip. Holiday quarters for companies that sell advertisements often see a decline in certain incomes after the close of the holiday-focused fourth quarter. The decline for Roku was modest and quickly offset by growth in the second quarter.\nHow investors will read that remains to be seen, but the firm has shown dramatic growth of its platform revenue—nearly 100 percent year-over-year.\nMore broadly, in the quarter ending June 30, 2017, Roku put up $99.62 million in revenue, less than its $100.09 million derived from its first quarter and under its fourth quarter result of $147.34 million. The company, despite its sequential-quarter declines, grew compared to its year-ago periods in each of the last four quarters.\nIf investors are willing to give more credence to Roku’s growing platform incomes as indicative of its corporate future, the sequential declines may not matter.\nAnd why might investors care a bit more about Roku’s platform revenue than its hardware incomes? Because the company generates the vast bulk of its gross margin from its platform revenue. Turning once again to Dawson of Jackdaw, the following chart shows precisely how the platform business is more gross profit than the hardware business for Roku:\n\nThat’s sharp. What should we make of the above?\nRoku must want out of the hardware business, at least as a leading revenue driver. It makes no money in that game. Notably, that makes it in a future-sense a nearly all-in OTT service that doesn’t generate its own content.\nThat isn’t a model that I would not have thought possible given the incredibly stiff arena of competition for content on the Internet today. Facebook is getting into a game that Netflix is pouring cash into, Amazon is playing, Apple is tinkering in the space, and Microsoft already picked up and dropped its video efforts.\nI wonder if that fact might help Roku. It has distribution and content providers want access to audiences. That confluence could be, in part, why Roku’s ARPU is doing this:\n\nThat bodes well for the firm that, as we saw before, has a history of active user accretion. Quickly growing high-margin businesses are worth something after all.\nWhat Roku is worth, however, is beyond me. With one revenue stream in decline, persistent losses, but big potential, the firm is going to be a fun one to price.\nHit up the S-1 for more, and send in your best finds.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/01/understanding-rokus-ipo-and-its-growing-platform-revenues/", "id": "1535492"}, {"title": "Roku files for $100M IPO", "text": "Roku has filed for an initial public offering and is looking to raise up to $100 million. The company will be listed on the NASDAQ appropriately under the ticker of ROKU.\nWe reported in July that Roku was planning an IPO in 2017. Roku has been able to capitalize on the cord-cutting trend, where many people, especially millennials, have opted not to pay for cable television. Instead, they are accessing content on digital platforms like Roku, Apple TV, Google’s Chromecast, Amazon’s Fire TV and others. Roku is the No. 1 streaming device when measured by total hours streamed.\nThis has been a long time coming. Roku was founded in 2002 and raised over $200 million from various VCs and investment firms. The company was key in helping create the home streaming device market. It was one of the first devices to target general users rather than the technically savvy. Roku never left that demographic.\nToday the company claims to have 15.1 million accounts and stream quarterly 3.5 billion hours of content, which is up 60 percent year-over-year.\nMenlo Ventures looks to be the largest shareholder with a 35.3 percent stake, followed by Fidelity with 12.9 percent, Twenty-First Century Fox at 7 percent and Globespan Capital Partners at 6.1 percent.\nRoku states its average revenue per unit is $11.22, up 35 percent. It reported $199 million in revenue in the six month period ending June 30, 2017, up from the year prior of $162 million. Its annual revenue numbers also increased year-over-year, up from $319 million to $398 million.\nThe company’s primary gross profit source is switching from hardware sales to its platform, mainly around advertising and subscription revenue. In January 2017, hardware sales represented 19 percent of total gross profit while down 28 percent. Meanwhile, the platform gross profit represented 81 percent of the total, up 104 percent from the six months prior.\nRoku is looking to go public at the same time as two other hardware startups-turned public companies are struggling. GoPro and Fitbit flipped the switch in 2014 and 2015, respectively, and after a brief pop, both company’s stock crashed and have yet to recover.

The first such accessory is Essential’s own 360 camera, which offers you an easy way to capture immersive images and video in a very small package. The Essential 360 camera is much smaller than most other consumer 360 cameras out there, and aims to be something that’s as easy to take with you wherever you go as the phone itself.\nI got a chance to take the 360 camera for a spin over the past few days, now that it’s preparing to ship out to early Essential customers. The diminutive camera easily slides into a pocket or bag, and snaps into place on the back of the Essential phone with a satisfying click. The magnetic force also feels strong enough that you can be confident the camera won’t fall off during use, while also keeping the accessory easy enough to remove when you want to.\nSnapping the camera on to the back of the Essential Phone results in the camera app itself launching right into 360-degree capture mode. This was a bit hit or miss for me – the camera app also launched, but sometimes I’d have to exit and relaunch to get the image preview to appear. Removing the camera also automatically quits the app, which is a nice feature.\nBy default, the app launches in photo capture mode, where you tap the virtual shutter button to grab a still. You can also pan around the image in live preview using your finger to see what the whole scene looks like. Essential stitches the image on the fly, so what you see is what you get when you tap the shutter.\n\nTapping the red dot next to the shutter will jump right into video recording, so that’s always only one tap away, too. Video capture also lets you pan around to see your surroundings, and again stitches the images from its two 210-degree cameras live to provide you with a real-time preview of what you’re recording.\nBoth the resulting images and the resulting video are good quality, and perfectly usable for sharing on Facebook and YouTube, as you can see with the examples provided. Stills come in at 12 MP, and the video records at 4K UHD resolution – 3840 x 1920, captured at 30 fps. Audio is recorded from the microphone on the camera, too, not the one on the phone, and that features a 4-mic array that captures 3D audio for more immersive effect.\n\nIn the end, Essential’s $50 camera add on is as good, or better, than some third-party mobile 360 camera options that are bulkier and more expensive. Also, this doesn’t really impact any of the video or photo results, but the Essential phone has a tiny fan in it to help with heat management, which I just find incredibly cool. Plus, it satisfies that most important quality for a camera: it’s more likely to be with you and usable, which is the key to making this kind of media more commonplace.\n", "tags": "essential", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/first-impressions-of-essentials-360-degree-camera-attachment/", "id": "1534745"}, {"title": "Uber’s new head of Asia is a former Goldman exec who once climbed Mount Everest", "text": "Regular run-ins with government regulators and battles with well-funded local rivals have made Asia challenging terrain for Uber. The challenge is such that it’s fitting that the U.S. ride-sharing giant has hired a man who once scaled the summit of Mount Everest to lead its business in the region.\nBrooks Entwistle, a former Chairman of Goldman Sachs Southeast Asia, was announced today as Uber’s Chief Business Officer, Asia Pacific.\n“After twenty years working in Asia, I couldn’t turn down the opportunity of shaping how the region moves over the next twenty,” Entwistle, who joins Uber from PE firm The Everstone Group, said in a statement.\nIn the role he’ll be responsible for business development, corporate development and marketing across Asia, excluding India and China, the latter being a market where Uber is no longer present. Interestingly, Uber said Entwistle will have a focus on “autonomous vehicle alliances.” While Uber has made progress on self-driving cars in the U.S. through its Otto unit — now known as Uber ATG — the company has yet to make a move in Asia, unlike rival Grab which partnered with MIT spin-off Nutonomy last year.\nAlso notable in Uber’s announcement are plans to “explore new opportunities to invest and grow our presence through strategic partnerships and investment opportunities.”\nThat looks like Uber will be doing investment deals across Asia, helping it catch up with a strategy that Grab has used in Southeast Asia to expand its business beyond merely ferrying passengers from point A to point B.\nGrab is developing a payment platform to help reach users and develop increased loyalty, and it has put particular emphasis on Indonesia — the region’s largest economy. Earlier this year, Grab announced a $700 million program dubbed ‘Indonesia 2020,’ which includes an allocation of upwards of $100 million for investment in startups and other local initiatives.\nGrab quickly got into that budget with the acquisition of Kudo, which sources told TechCrunch was priced at $80 million-$100 million, but it has indicated an interest in deploying more capital to help spread its base and business.\n\nUber may well be looking to follow in Grab’s footsteps and make investments of its own to growth its marketshare, which indicators suggest has fallen lately as Grab — which recently raised $2 billion from Didi and SoftBank — has pushed the accelerator to the floor.\nEntwistle will also have government relationships to work out. Just this week Uber was suspended in the Philippines for a month, it is also currently out of action in Macau and has been knee-capped in Taiwan, where it recently returned with a licensed taxi service after UberX was ruled to be illegal. It has also scrapped with regulators in Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia among other places over the past year.\nWith talk of a potential Uber exit from Southeast Asia in some media, there’s also an argument that Entwistle could be a deal-maker who looks for the kind of amicable departure that Uber found in China last year and again in Russia this year.\nSuch talk ballooned up after Grab raised its recent funding round and, while watching a key ally refuel its war chest is a blow, Uber’s position across Southeast Asia isn’t so far behind that it should needs to concede. However, if it deems itself to be losing ground in the U.S. then it isn’t impossible to imagine resources being diverted to protect that the home turf above all others.\nBut there’s much more to come in Southeast Asia where the ride-hailing industry is only getting started.

Alongside Singapore, it was one of the first two markets in the region where Uber reached profitability, as TechCrunch reported last year, while the country is understood to account for a sizable portion of revenue for Grab, too.\nUber has run into issues across Asia, but recent hotspots have included Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong and Thailand.", "tags": "car-sharing,commuting,business,transport", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/uber-suspends-its-service-in-the-philippines/", "id": "1527408"}, {"title": "Beijing’s public transport system gets an app for paying fares — but Apple isn’t invited", "text": "Apple continues to be locked out of China’s massive mobile payments space. The latest reminder came this week when Beijing’s transportation system opened up to smartphone payments… via an Android app.\nAlready Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s Alipay services dominate China’s mobile payment space, which is estimated to have processed $3 trillion last year, but now Apple has missed out being part of what is sure to be a very convenient usage case.\nThe Financial Times reports that Beijing’s public transport payments company Yikatong launched an app for ‘most’ Android devices that allows commutes to ditch their physical card and pay fares via their phone.\nApple isn’t included most likely because its operating system doesn’t support third-party payments like Yikatong, instead favoring its own Apple Pay. But it is also worth noting that iOS accounts for just 16 percent of all smartphones in China, according to data from Kantar as of March. Though the figure in urban areas is likely to skew in Apple’s favor, it doesn’t dominate which may be another factor.\nIt’s unclear whether potential iPhone owners would go to the lengths of buying an Android device just to use the transportation app, but it’s another piece of anecdotal evidence that shows the difficulty Apple is up against in China, where revenue was down 10 percent year-on-year in its most recent quarter of business.\nApple recently removed the popular tip feature from chat app WeChat, a move that some believe might tempt its users to move over to Android where it continues to exist. While WeChat itself, far and away the most popular Chinese app, has ‘leveled the playing field’ in some ways by standardizing parts of the mobile experience for users whether they are on iOS or Android, the latter of which is often (far) cheaper.\nThat said, analysts are optimistic that the forthcoming next iPhone — which has been heavily linked with a range of new features — can sell well in China if Apple is able to differentiate it from previous models.

The examples are countless. Food delivery, dry cleaning, jet planes, home services rental bikes, or even phone chargers to name but a few — but how about farming equipment?\nThat’s the case in India, where a startup called EM3 AgriServices is helping rural farmers literally get their hands on specialist (and expensive) equipment and machines that would ordinarily be out of their reach. The goal is to help them earn their livelihood with cutting-edge tech without breaking the bank.\nThe concept is actually quite straightforward. EM3 works with farmers who own equipment like tractors, harvesters and other mechanical implements by allowing them to ‘rent’ out their assets to help pay off the purchase or generate additional revenue. Farmers, typically those in remote regional with small holdings and limited capital, then get access to quality implements and machines on a pay-as-you-use basis on either an hourly or acreage pricing.\nThat’s important when most farms in India are smaller than three acres. Tight economics, and a reliance on loans to make big-ticket purchases, are thought to be a key factor responsible for a high level of suicides among farmers over the past twenty years.\n“The average Indian farm holding is just one percent of what you’d find in U.S., so farmers aren’t able to afford technology, even basic mechanization, because the capital load is too high,” EM3 founder and managing director Rohtash Mal (pictured above) told TechCrunch in an interview.\nAnd he should know. Mal, a 63-year-old self-confessed “corporate world veteran,” started EM3 with his son Adwitiya Mal (CEO) in 2013 after a spell in charge of agriculture machinery manufacturer Escorts gave him a glimpse into the struggles of Indian farmers.\n“In the farm equipment business one thing became clear, we did everything we could to help customers buy our products, but the fact is that the small farm could not afford the rate of technology,” Mal senior said.\n“We’re inspired by what happens in tech world, but this hasn’t been done in agriculture before. The need wasn’t there in a lot of markets, such as the U.S., which were the foundation heads of technology, but the need is here in India,” he added.\nThe company calls its business farming-as-a-service — or Faas.\nUnlike Uber, which has pioneered an online business model, EM3 is ‘tech-enabled’ rather than ‘tech.’ That’s to say that while it uses common on-demand tech to manage supply-demand, customer data and more, the majority of its business is offline. That’s because, quite simply, its customer base remains disconnected from the internet.\n“The majority of farmers are not on smartphones,” Mal junior said. “The smartphone penetration is increasing but it isn’t at critical mass yet so we have a physical on the ground presence.”\nSo where there are apps for those ahead of the curve, EM3 operates call centers for handling requests from farmers — both inventory owners and prospective renters — and it deploys local representatives in the villages that it serves. But even the select farmers who are online and own smartphones find something comforting and secure about talking to a person on the other end of the phone when it comes to business matters that impact their life, the EM3 execs said.\n\nTo date, EM3 has focused on central parts of India where it claims to have worked with 8,000 farms through its 10 service centers. Mal senior explained that its platform covers machinery and services that span all seasons, but customer activity levels do vary during different parts of the farming calendar and based on location, crop type, etc.\nThe startup recently partnered with the local government of Rajasthan, India’s largest province by size and a major agriculture producer, to make a push into helping thousands more farmers. It is planning further forays, too, after raising significant funding from investors.\nEM3 closed a $10 million in Series B financing led by Global Innovation Fund and VC firm Aspada which will be put to work expanding into more regions, increasing its inventory and developing tech. EM3 previously raised a $3.3 million Series A round led by Aspada in 2015.\nFurther down the line, Mal senior said he can envisage its business moving into other areas of a farmer’s business where it believes it can add value.\n“There’s no other company [offering this service yet, but I’m sure there will be me-toos,” he said.\n“We are still significantly ahead, but will have to add more and more to the menu of services to keep our lead. We want to become more dedicated to the farmer and look for more opportunities in farming and adjacent spaces.”\nAlready there is competition with Gold Farm and Trringo, a subsidiary of automotive conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra, opening similar services over the past year.\nInterest in agritech in India has heated up in recent years. Earlier in 2017, Accel backed AgroStar, a startup that offers a range of guidance and e-commerce services targeted at rural farmers, in its first deal in the sector. Plenty of other VCs in the country have expressed their interest about getting into the space, which has the potential to harness the power of technology to help many farmers in a profound way.", "tags": "business,renting,battery-charger,energy", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/em3/", "id": "1526956"}, {"title": "Indian messaging app Hike acquires hardware startup Creo", "text": "India-based messaging app Hike is back on the acquisition trail after it picked up Creo, a hardware company that previously released smartphones, streaming devices and an operating system.\nThe price of the deal is undisclosed.

Barely days after WeWork announced plans to enter the region, which is home to over 600 million people, through the acquisition of Singapore startup Spacemob, now a company that operates like an Airbnb for office space rentals has raised money.\nFlySpaces, a startup headquartered in the Philippines, raised $2.1 million this week in funding round described as pre-Series A.\nThe company operates a service that aggregates a selection of co-working spaces in six cities across Asia — Manila and Cebu in the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong/Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. It was launched in 2015 with $500,000 in initial financing, and CEO and co-founder Mario Berta was previously with Rocket Internet’s Uber rival Easy Taxi.\nWhile its core focus is office space rentals, Berta told TechCrunch that FlySpaces has diversified into other enterprise verticals including event venues, retail space and corporate dining. He said other expansions may see it move into billboard spaces.\n“We’re looking at how we can cross sell other things into this space once we acquire a customer,” Berta said.\nOn the business side, the FlySpaces makes money through commissions on bookings made through its site. It retains a cut when a customer that first found a space through its service signs on for a longer leasing, Berta confirmed. That seems essential when most people might book a day or another short lease to test an office before committing to a longer booking. In addition, the company also runs some ads selectively, but that accounts for less than 25 percent of income.\nBerta said his company is already profitable but it sought out investment to ramp up its growth through hiring, increased marketing and product development. The backing comes from undisclosed players in the retail space — although one named investor Net Group co-president Raymond Rufino — because Berta found that tech VCs “don’t understand” the FlySpaces business. But he admitted that there’s the potential to be more strategic with these backers.\nFlySpaces already covers the main markets where English is a primary language for business in Southeast Asia, and Berta said that while there is no immediate plan for further country launches, he’d like to be in all ASEAN countries eventually. That’ll necessitate moves into Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia at some point.\nSpeaking generally on the industry — which now includes WeWork in Southeast Asia — Berta said that one of his biggest frustrations is that co-working spaces are commonly thought to be focused on tech startups and freelancers. A point he said isn’t true.\n“It’s huge misconception, the money is in SMEs and corporates,” he argued. “It’s ideal for companies who don’t want to invest in capex and want to maximize their office space.”\nSome of the customers that have used FlySpaces include Google, P&G, Media Corp and Uber, according to its website.", "tags": "coworking,business", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/flyspaces/", "id": "1526022"}, {"title": "China’s top social networks face investigation for hosting porn and illicit content", "text": "China continues to crack down on online media after the government announced that it is investigating three of the country’s most influential social networks for hosting illicit content.\nThe Office for Cyberspace Administration is looking into content on chat app WeChat, micro-blogging platform Weibo and web forum Baidu Tieba, each of which stands accused of failing to stamp out material that “jeopardised national security,” the BBC reports.\nPrincipally that includes content related to terrorism, pornography and other obscenities, the office said.

Viu is available in 15 countries in Asia and the Middle East with 12 million monthly active users. It takes a hybrid model offering both paid subscriptions and ad-supported user options. Vuclip, which was acquired two years ago, differentiates by offering shorter videos in 19 countries across India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nOn the music side, PCCW Media has MOOV which is available in Hong Kong. It expanded to Vietnam last year, where the firm sees potential among a young popular with booming 3G data subscriptions.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Janice Lee, PCCW Media managing director, said the business didn’t need to raise capital since it is funded by its parent, but the deal is driven by potential synergies.\n“We saw that there are strategic investors we feel we are very complementary [and] playing in different parts of the OTT space. Foxconn is a transforming company [while] Temasek and Hony have [backed] companies that have been successful in the media space,” Lee said.\nFoxconn in particular, which is best known as a key Apple manufacturer, could open the door to hardware products in the future, although didn’t elaborate on that in detail.\n“It’s a direction where we see cooperation,” she said. “There are definitely commercial synergies to working together.”\nIndeed, Foxconn has made a sustained push into internet-of-things and media in recent times.

There may still be country launches, but adding new content — including the company’s own original productions out of Hong Kong and markets like India and Indonesia — is the immediate priority alongside product development and localization tweaks.\nThe overall strategy is to take a local approach to content — not unlike Iflix — to gain engagement in individual market. Already though, PCCW Media claims its most engaged users are on its service for upwards of 1.3-1.8 hours per day, consuming more than 15 videos per week.\nAs for MOOV, PCCW Media has been more measured with its approach with just two active markets.\n“We selectively assess where we go next,” Lee explained, since the company believes that, for now in Asia, “video is much more ready for monetization for both advertising and subscriptions.”", "tags": "distributed-computing,iflix,pacific-century-group", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/pccw-media-raises-110m/", "id": "1525535"}, {"title": "Indian startup Flux Auto wants to democratize self-driving tech for trucks", "text": "A young startup in India wants to makes autonomous driving technology more widely available for truck operators, especially those outside of the U.S., by lower the cost significantly.\nThe concept of self-driving trucks sat in the background for some time as the vision of autonomous cars ferrying consumers from A to B hogged the limelight, but the potential for trucking is at least on par if not higher — particularly on a global level. Beyond potential safety gains, integrating elements of autonomous car tech can help boost efficiency, too.\nThus far the technology has been pioneered in Silicon Valley, where giants like Uber and Google are working on bringing the tech into trucks — via their Otto (now Uber ATG) and Waymo business units, respectively — while Tesla is preparing to enter to foray. All these solutions require expensive kit that isn’t deployable on all vehicles. That combination means it is likely to be out of reach for most of the world’s trucking community once it is finally available on a commercial basis.\nThat’s where Flux Auto, a 16-person startup based in Bangalore, hopes to make a difference by democratizing autonomous systems. It is developing technology that, when finished, could enable any kind of truck to be retrofitted with self-driving car technology at a far lower price.\nTo make its tech accessible, Flux Auto has had to make a compromise. It doesn’t use Lidar — Light Detection and Ranging — sensors which have become the standard for autonomous vehicles, but are incredible expensive. Waymo CEO John Krafcik recently revealed a Lidar would cost $75,000 a few years ago, but these days he claims it is just 10 percent of that price. Even still, at $7,500 it remains prohibitively costly for many truck operates — and that’s just one component.\n“While the competition is focusing on LIDAR technology which is very expensive and processing heavy (due to a lot of unneeded data), our vision algorithms can be used with any cheap cameras and has a much quicker response time. This drives down our cost and in turn, the cost for the customer as well, all while having similar levels of accuracy as a LIDAR system,” Flux Auto founder Pranav Manpuria explained to TechCrunch.\n\nUber ATG’s trucks use a Lidar mounted above the cab\nFlux Auto is looking at a product that would retail for around $3,000-$4,500, the price range would be dependent on the level of features a customer wants.\nThe system is being developed to handle cruise control, lane keeping and collision avoidance. Like Uber AG and Waymo, the idea is to take the strain off of drivers and help make journeys more efficient.\n“We’re using cameras along with other sensors — sonar, radar, ultrasonic, etc — to understand everything that’s happening around the vehicle, and make decisions based on that,” Manpuria said. “We’re developing our entire tech stack as an after market accessory. This allows us to target the massive market of already existing commercial vehicles.”\nManpuria, who graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology and previously ran a payment startup, said the company is looking to raise around $1.5 million to fulfill its goal of deploying its systems on trucks in a range of markets beyond India. Initially it began testing on cars, but it has just equipped its first truck (see above) for the next stage of testing before the end of this month.\nMoney from investors will go towards expanding the team and developing its technology. Flux Auto is aiming to deploy its tech on 2,500 vehicles within the next twelve months. That’s likely to necessitate a U.S. office, and Manpuria said the business may need to migrate to the U.S. to continue its development in the future. That’s particularly true if India bans autonomous cars, as its transport minister has threatened.\n“I’ve been very interested in self-driving and it’s benefits for a while now. However, working on a self driving car didn’t seem appealing since car owners would be reluctant to spend a few thousand dollars on technology where the benefits to them aren’t that obvious,” he said.\n“Where this technology makes the most sense, and can have the biggest impact is the trucking industry — and the benefits we provide with our technology are worth an investment into it by truck owners,” said Manpuria.", "tags": "entrepreneurship,transport,business,economy", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/flux-auto/", "id": "1524040"}, {"title": "SoftBank’s Vision Fund backs Flipkart in record India tech investment", "text": "SoftBank missed out on getting a piece of Flipkart when its deal to acquire Snapdeal, the e-commerce firm which SoftBank backed in 2015, fell apart last month, but the Japanese tech giant has finally gotten there.\n Flipkart today confirmed that SoftBank has invested in its business, via its $100 billion Vision Fund, as part of an extension to the $1.4 billion financing round which was announced in April.\nThe Vision Fund is buying a mix of primary and secondary sales, but the size of the investment is not disclosed.

Afterwards, Chiu became the founding general manager of Camp Mobile Taiwan, a branch of Naver’s mobile app development subsidiary.\n“We already have a lot of accelerators in Taipei, but I think there is still a gap for Taiwanese startups that want to go global and I want to see more succeed.

Chiu says founders will be matched with four to six mentors and encouraged to talk to them weekly.\nThe small size of Taiwan (total population 24 million) means that startups targeting rapid growth usually need to go abroad, but Taiwan still makes a good test market because of its high smartphone penetration rate and the willingness of users to be early adopters of apps and online services. While Taiwan’s startup ecosystem is frequently compared with other Asian countries, Chiu believes its best role model might actually be Israel.\n“Korea was able to develop unicorns within its own markets, but Taiwanese startups should be more like Israeli startups where they had to seek to go global from the outset,” he says.\nChiu cites photo-editing app PicCollage as an example of a Taiwanese startup that found success abroad with 150 million users worldwide. PicCollage’s founders worked and studied in the U.S. before launching the company, but founders who don’t have that kind of experience can learn how to adapt for international audiences, Chiu says.\nFor example, he notes that Gogolook’s founders were born and educated in Taiwan, but decided early on to launch their main product, caller ID app Whoscall, abroad and seek international investors once they realized unwanted phone calls are a near-universal problem. At Gogolook, Chiu was responsible for securing global partnerships in Japan, Korea, the Middle East and Southeast Asia for Whoscall, which has been downloaded more than 50 million times.\n“If you can find international co-founders or partners, then take advantage of that, but if you can’t, you need to be more aggressive to evaluate users from global markets and also do more product testing to know what they really want,” he says.\nTaiwan’s tech industry is known for its hardware prowess; one of its most notable hardware startups is electric scooter company Gogoro. Chiu believes Taiwan’s hardware manufacturing resources has the potential to translate into startups that can not only build infrastructure for smart cities, but also integrate software that is frequently updated and adaptable to different markets.\nChiu will work with SparkLabs Taipei’s two venture partners Alex Wu and Tony Ling. Wu is currently vice president of marketing and communications at Newsela and previously worked at Quora, Facebook and Obama for America. Ling was previously managing director at Silver Lake Partners, where he sat on the boards of GoDaddy and IPC Systems.

The size of the investment was not disclosed.\nYes, Didi is backing yet another Uber rival in another corner of the world.\nAside from Taxify, the Europe and Africa Uber competitor that it invested in earlier this month, Didi has shares in Lyft in the U.S., India’s Ola, 99 in Latin America and Southeast Asia’s Grab. It also owns equity in Uber courtesy of the unique terms of the acquisition of the Uber China business last year.\nIn that respect, it makes sense that it is considering investments in basically any ride-sharing company in the world. Beyond giving it the potential to expand its service through acquisitions or partnerships at a later, these deals also help Didi — which is the world’s second highest value tech company behind Uber — to put Uber under some pressure. The firm can help its global partners b giving them more money and providing the expertise and tech capabilities that it has developed from serving 400 million users in China.\nAs the saying goes: the enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n“Didi Chuxing brings leading edge AI capabilities, insight and expertise to our organization as we enter our next phase of growth,” Careem CEO Mudassir Sheikha said in a statement. “This evolution in our long relationship will enable Careem to more effectively pursue growth opportunities through continued innovation and sustainability.”\nDubai-headquartered Careem started out five years old as a scrappy Uber competitor, but it has grown into quite a formidable business in its own right. Back in June, it raised $500 million from investors that include auto giant Daimler at a valuation of $1.2 billion — that’s up on the $1 billion valuation that it scored when it raised the first part of that round in December 2016. In total, Careem has raised just shy of $570 million to date, and its other backers include Rakuten and Saudi Telecom Company (STC).\nAs for its business, Careem operates in 80 cities across 13 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. It claims to have over 12 million registered customers and in excess of 250,000 drivers. It has even played the Didi big brother role. Back in July, it invested an undisclosed sum into Egypt-based Swvl.\nFollowing this investment Didi said its “global framework of collaboration” now covers over 60 percent of the world’s population across 1,000 cities. That gives a clear insight into what its next ambition is having already driven Uber out of China via that acquisition deal.\nThings might be about to get a little more complicated if SoftBank, which has invested alongside Didi in many of its global deals, backs Uber. Following media reports, CEO Mashayoshi Son yesterday confirmed his interest in doing a deal with Uber, but he said that SoftBank is also weighing a deal with Lyft.\nNote: This post was updated to correct Careem’s financing history", "tags": "careem,didi-chuxing", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/didi-backs-careem/", "id": "1524515"}, {"title": "Iflix raises $133M for its Netflix-style service for emerging markets", "text": "Iflix, an Asia-based startup providing Netflix-like streaming services in emerging markets, has landed $133 million in fresh funding to accelerate its business.\nThe investment was led by U.S. media conglomerate Hearst, which counts BuzzFeed, Vice and Roku among its investment portfolio. The group was joined by another new backer EDBI — the corporate investment arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board — alongside undisclosed clients of Singapore-based DBS bank. Existing investors joining included Evolution Media, UK broadcaster Sky, Malaysia’s Catcha Group, Liberty Global, Jungle Ventures and PLDT.\nIflix was started in May 2015, initially in selected Asian markets. Today its streaming service is priced around $3 per month and available in 19 countries thanks to expansions into the Middle East and Africa. The business has raised close to $300 million from investors to date. It started out with a $30 million pre-launch round in 2015, before adding $45 million from Sky last year and completing a $90 million raise in March of this year.\nThat most recent round valued the company at $500 million, but there’s no word on what the valuation following this new financing is. (We’re working on getting that detail.)\nNetflix is the most obvious rival to Iflix but, with over 100 million paying subscribers and 5.2 million new additions in the last quarter alone, few can rival the U.S. media giant. In that respect, more regional competition includes Singapore’s HOOQ, which is backed by telecom firm Singtel, and PCCW Media-owned Vuclip, as well as local single-country streaming services are more valid comparisons.\nIflix said it had five million registered users back in March, but it isn’t giving an update on that this time around. It instead hailed “tremendous growth” which it said includes a 3X increase in subscriber numbers and 2X rise in user engagement over the past year. Revenue, it said, is up 230 percent year-on-year, but it is keeping quiet on raw figures.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Iflix CEO Mark Britt played down inevitable comparisons with Netflix, insisting that the services do not share the same target audience.\n“We very genuinely don’t see Netflix as a competitor, we see ourselves as providing a new service for the mass markets,” he said.\nBritt explained that Netflix’s model targets the global elite, those with high-end devices like an iPhone, disposable income and a credit card for payment. Iflix, he claimed, is aimed at those with lower-end devices and poorer quality internet access, but a desire to always consume on mobile.\n“If Netflix is the iPhone of content streaming, our aspiration is to be the Android,” Britt added. “We’d love to be a secondary choice to the upper socials — if you love Netflix you should probably get Iflix as an addition — but for the mass market, the majority of their consumption is on a mobile device.”\n\nThere’s certainly plenty of pie to fight for. A recent report from Media Partners Asia forecast that online video consumption in Asia alone could surpass $20 billion by 2020, although the figure falls to $3.2 billion when China — which is dominated by local players, and where Iflix is not present — is removed.\nNonetheless, Iflix has taken steps that are similar to Netflix. This year it began broadcasting its own original programming — bringing an underground comedy series from Malaysia to its platform earlier this year — and that is expanding to a dozen countries. While in March it hired Sean Carey, who was formerly VP of global television for Netflix, as its own chief content officer. It has also moved into live sport, having captured the rights to Indonesia’s soccer league, and Britt said it is focusing on acquiring more local content, including first releases from cinema’s and local productions.\n“We’ve realized the key for us is local content, not the Western content studios — the majority of our top 10 content is regional or local,” he told TechCrunch. “Western content sets the bar for binge-watching, but in terms of reaching the mass market, what’s having a bigger impact is taking content from local cinemas or distributors.”\nThat’s where this new funding is likely to be put to work, growing that local collection with a focus on exclusives and first-runs. Britt said that Iflix may also look to enter new regions, too, with Latin America on the list of potential entries thanks to its similarities with regions where Iflix already plays.\n“The opportunity is very real in emerging markets globally,” he added. “TV has gone from stalling in the last few years to actual decline in most emerging markets. Our understanding of that is that it is actually yesterday’s product [since] the majority of the emerging classes worldwide are aged under 25.”\n“We’re the only platform talking with [studios and producers] about what this new experience should look like for these 1.3 billion people [in emerging markets] in the next few years,” Britt said.", "tags": "business,economy,streaming,iflix", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/iflix-133m/", "id": "1524169"}, {"title": "SoftBank transfers its $5B stake in Nvidia to the Vision Fund", "text": "SoftBank has confirmed that its 4.9 percent stake in Nvidia is to be transferred to the Vision Fund, its colossal investment vehicle that’s targeting a $100 billion final close.\nThe Japanese tech firm bought the position in chip-maker Nvidia, which has forayed into AI and self-driving car tech in recent years, back in May for a reported $4 billion. The Vision Fund held the rights to acquire that asset and the transfer was confirmed today in a filing.\nThe price paid was never disclosed but, with Nvidia’s market cap nearly at $100 billion today, the shares are worth around $5 billion right now. Following the deal, the Vision Fund becomes Nvidia’s fourth largest shareholder.\nBeyond Nvidia, the Vision Fund is also picking up SoftBank’s share of medtech startup Guardant Health, which raised $360 million led by SoftBank in May. There’s plenty of cross-over beyond those deals. Previously, Softbank sold one-quarter of ARM, the chip giant it acquired last year for north of $30 billion, to the Vision Fund.\nThat ARM deal is a key component to the interest in Nvidia. SoftBank CEO Mashayoshi Son explained that Nvidia’s involvement in the Vision Fund makes particular sense because of the relationship that it has with ARM, which licenses its chip design to Nvidia among others. Addressing investors and press at a Q1 earnings event, Son dedicated plenty of time to explaining the Vision Fund which, as he himself admitted, is quite like any other VC investment vehicle in tech today.\nBeyond its sheer size, he said that the fund is about developing a group of the world’s best companies to capitalize on the coming “information revolution.” Son explained that neither SoftBank nor the fund will look to take majority ownership in companies or invest strictly for profit, rather the goal is to develop a portfolio of top tech firms that can explore partnerships and synergies to grow together.\n“We are ready to create this group and Nvidia is part of that,” he said.\nBack when the Vision Fund announced its first close of $93 billion — that also happened in May, it was a busy month — SoftBank disclosed that the fund has the right to buy its stakes in ARM, Nvidia and Guardant Health, as well as Intelsat, OneWeb and SoFi. Expect more share swapping between the two entities going forward.\nSoftBank’s other transactions may soon include its first ride-sharing investment in North America, too. Son revealed his intention to cut a deal with either Uber of Lyft — he said a decision hasn’t been made on which one yet.

I met Xuezhao for tea on a park bench in Potrero Hill earlier this week to chat about her strategy for the fund.\nI spend a good portion of my time meeting with investors, but if you don’t know a lot about the scene, Potrero Hill is not a place you go to meet VCs. Hot spots for meetings generally range from opulent coffee shops in San Francisco to opulent offices on Sand Hill Road. So a park bench in a fairly residential, low-profile neighborhood stands out.\nBut even more than that, Xuezhao has a surprisingly laid-back demeanor and an apparent academic appreciation for technology. With a PhD in quantitative psychology, the former head of mergers and acquisitions for Dropbox can do something that most other investors cannot — relate to the incredibly talented founders of highly technical startups.\nBreaking rank with increasingly flashy, services-focused AI studios like Yoshua Bengio’s Element AI, Xuezhao wants Basis Set to be the anti-VC. Everything blindly promised by AI-focused VCs gets a layer of realism. Data sets: What data, why and does it actually exist anywhere? Technical mentors: How about I just sit down and we both start by being honest with each other — then if we can’t come up with it, let’s text someone who can.\nWe spent about an hour talking about the state of AI startups and how Basis Set Ventures aims to capture the windfall from the burgeoning space. I’ve edited all remarks for brevity.\nTechCrunch: Why did you feel $136 million was the right number to start with? \nLan Xuezhao: The number is more strategic than anything else. I feel like there’s a gap between Series A and smaller seed deals. There are a lot of smaller seed funds and it’s hard to compete with them because there are so many.\nAt Series A there are a lot of bigger names who do a very good job with those. But in-between, there’s a sweet spot for checks ranging in size between one and three million dollars. And not that many funds are able to do that.\nTC: Can an AI focus still be a differentiator in a market that now seems saturated with AI-focused funds? What do you think is the real value a VC can add to a machine intelligence startup?\nLX: Given my experience, I think go to market is the most important because algorithms are less defensible. Being able to help startups close larger clients is something I spend a lot of time on. Startups value me as a thought partner. You don’t have to be very formal with me in terms of presentation or reporting numbers.\nI’ll sit down with a founder and we will go through an Excel spreadsheet and figure things out. I’ll help startups recruit people. Those are the resources that people want. I’m very pragmatic; I want to help founders get this stuff done.\nThe fund is very focused in terms of thesis and size. We do a lot of inbound leads, but we also do a lot of research to ensure our leads are not biased. Every Friday we talk to customers, the real people who actually use these products, and we try to figure out what works best and what doesn’t work at all. A lot of times the products people are using are from companies not based in California. These end up being very helpful conversations.\nTC: Is the AI studio model overhyped?\nLX: There is value in technical talent. I have advisors and their perspective is very valuable to me. Even product managers and designers, their perspectives are really valuable to a fund. But you want to make sure that these people are involved enough to actually help uncover blind spots.\nSome incubators try to provide data which will help companies build early products. I think that’s a little tricky because the data needs to be very targeted. There is a lot of potential for value, but it depends on exactly what a company needs.\nTC: Are machine learning APIs and developer tools defensible as investments in the long run?\nLX: I’ve seen this approach working for some companies, but I’m a bit torn. I don’t have a strong opinion. It’s truly a case by case basis. I have invested in one company that fits this profile and things are going great for them, but I’ve also heard cases where it’s not working out so well.\nI like when companies develop their own technology. The integrations need to be good and the experience needs to be native in order for this to be useful. Developers need to have very strong incentives to make this work. It’s not that easy to get all three, but if you can, companies are in a pretty good position.\nTC: Do you agree with the majority of folks opting to invest in verticalized AI over horizontal platforms?\nLX: I believe in vertically integrated full-stack solutions. Algorithms are getting more and more commoditized and big companies are trying to do a lot of the horizontal plays. It’s hard to do well there.\nTC: Are you OK with startups using off-the-shelf AI tech early on?\nLX: You need to be building something that actually solves a problem versus working on tech for three years and building something that people will not use. AI is a path to solving a problem versus the solution. AI is not the goal, it’s something that solves a problem. Having a real product that people will actually use sometimes means using off-the-shelf tech. Then, in the future, when the product actually takes off, you can make the tech more robust.\nTC: You’ve been investing in building a quantitative sourcing engine; what’s the real value that it brings? Is this a natural application of AI inside Basis Set?\nLX: Quantitative sourcing is a great way to cover blind spots. Each person’s network is limited and biased. It’s a great tool to supplement people’s own network so that you have a shot at seeing something you otherwise might not see. When doing CorpDev for Dropbox, I first hired a PhD from MIT who did a lot of work building us a quantitative sourcing engine. Together we found a lot of interesting companies that we definitely wouldn’t have seen if we didn’t use that engine. This approach won’t replace traditional sourcing, but it’s a really strong tool and I plan to build one for Basis Set Ventures.\nA lot of the challenge is finding the right signal. The algorithms themselves don’t actually need to be that complicated. There will be some curve smoothing when we look at growth etc., but most of it is understanding the problem and finding the right signal so that you can get the right trigger set up when something happens. It requires domain expertise in the same way as AI, though.", "tags": "venture-capital,basis-set-ventures,artificial-intelligence,finance", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/basis-set-ventures-gets-real-to-get-to-the-heart-of-ai-startups/", "id": "1534246"}, {"title": "Egyptian technology startups stand on the shoulders of giants", "text": "\n\nFor a young Youssri Helmy, it was a Tandy Radio Shack (TRS) 80 that first piqued his curiosity in technology. For Wael Amin, it was the Commodore 64 that he received when he was four years old. Indeed, Youssri and Wael developed a passion for using technology to solve some of the world’s toughest problems, and put that passion to work by founding an Egyptian technology company called ITWORX, a firm that would grow to employ more than 800 people with eight offices worldwide.\nFor Youssef Aly, it was an MSX computer he programmed to show his brother he was the dumbest guy in the world and that Youssef was the smartest. For one of his co-founders, Hamdy Khalil, it was his Atari 2200. They founded eSpace as one of the MENA region’s original “hacker firms.”\nAs a young PhD student at MIT, Dr. Khaled Ismail was motivated by the engineering challenge of designing the smallest devices possible. This drive led him to create Egypt’s first chip design firm, SySDSoft.\nTo the concern the parents of 16-year-old Waleed Khalil — the founder of several electronics firms — it was his interest in electricity and the products that use it that launched his journey to develop Olkya, the first electronic products company in Egypt.\nA young Alaa Agamawi got his start working for his family business in 1979, which re-sold western computers into Egypt. There, his desire grew to develop Arabic software that could reach the masses in the Middle East and to build an Egyptian technology industry that global markets would notice.\nWith technology and curious minds, these founders not only built great products and companies, they created the foundation for a strong and resilient technology sector that has been an economic driver and job creator in a country looking for stable footing.\nThe technology localizer\nAlaa Agamawi is one of the pioneering founders of Egypt’s IT sector. Though his family business re-sold western computers in Egypt, he knew that software, not hardware, presented the best growth opportunity. The family business was slow, as English-based software had a small market in Egypt in the mid-1980s. The problem, Alaa saw, was that the operating system DOS did not work in Arabic.\nThis sent Alaa down a path to lay the foundation of the Egyptian technology industry. In 1982, Alaa founded Arabic Information Systems (Info Arab), which created the first Arabization utility for DOS. He later developed a simple Arabic word processor. Slowly, multinational software companies started to see the Arabic language countries as a viable market and started to approach Alaa to localize their software. In 1986, he developed an Arabized spellchecker for Apple, which was the first systematic Arabic analyzer.\nThere were several spin-offs from Info Arab from some of the incredible engineers he hired. One of those engineers was Youssri Helmy, who was very interested in graphics applications. Alaa knew Youssri’s curious mind was limited at Info Arab and supported him in his next endeavor.\nPutting Egypt’s’ IT solutions on the global map\nYoussri Helmy has always been a man ahead of his time, with incredible technology insights and vision. He went to Cairo University at the age of 17 to learn electrical engineering. Youssri thought the classes were a waste of time, so he started to learn about software development on his own at night. While working at Info Arab, Youssri was responsible for porting accounting software to an Apple computer in Arabic. He loved writing software and wanted to know what software Egyptians wanted.\nSo in the late 1980s, he created an Apple user community called “Apple Pie” in Egypt. He met all 1,000 Apple users in Egypt to understand how they wanted to use their computer. He found that people wanted a bilingual drawing package, and thus his first startup was born. He developed a low-end graphics program that Apple loved, and soon he had a licensing agreement with Apple. Unfortunately, the royalties stopped in 1992 and he had to make important decisions about his future. He was 30 years old and married with a daughter. Luckily enough, he met Wael Amin and they went on to create the largest software outsourcing company in Egypt.\n \nWael Amin was also an overachiever, and at a very early age he saw the power of technology and wanted to harness it. He went to the American University in Cairo (AUC) at the age of 14 and graduated by the time he was 17 in 1993. He then started with Microlabs with two partners, developing software products for the Middle East. Youssri meet Wael and was excited about Microlabs because it was developing Microsoft Windows applications and he thought it would complement its Apple applications, so he bought the company. In a year, they were bankrupt.\nOne week after the bankruptcy, Youssri and Wael started ITWORX together to use technology to solve problems. A former employee of Youssri’s found a job at Corel in Canada. The company was impressed with this engineer and asked if there were other Egyptian software developers. Soon Youssri was on a plane to Canada and ITWORX had its first customer. The relationship with Corel was not typical for software outsourcing in the 1990s. Corel wanted to produce ideas from ITWORX, which included a video editor that won several awards. ITWORX grew to 1,000 engineers at its biggest in 2001, and was able to launch a couple of spin-offs in the U.S. and Egypt.\nThe big dreamer \nDr. Khaled Ismail has always been driven by engineering challenges. Although MIT wanted him to stay on after he graduated with a PhD, he wanted to work for IBM research labs and wanted to push the limits of making chips faster. At IBM he developed about eight patents and set a world record on the speed electronics could move on a chip.\nAlthough Ismail was very successful in the U.S., he wanted to return to Egypt and develop technology products. He founded a couple of companies, including in 2002 SySDSoft, which designed wireless technologies on chips. This type of technology was not heard of in Egypt. Ismail’s goal was having a team of 1,000 highly skilled engineers. In the first week of business, SySDSoft had customers on five continents. In three years he was able to hire 100 amazing engineers. Once they focused on developing the intellectual property based on LTE technology, things really took off for SySDSoft.\nIn 2010 as consolidation was happening in the industry, Intel approached SySDSoft to acquire them, to which they agreed. In fact, Ismail was negotiating with Intel in the United States as the 2011 revolution was happening in Egypt. Although the revolution slowed down the negotiations, it did not stop it and terms were reached a month after the revolution, even with the lack of Egyptian government creating massive political risk and weekly protests.\nThe Egyptian hackers\nThe first computer science program at the university was not in Cairo but at Alexandria University. There were two groups of friends who went to Alexandria University in the 1990s and worked on software problems. One group had Youssef Aly, who would go to the MIT website and look for computer problems to solve; the other group, lead by Hamdy Khalil, would do weekend-long hacker events at his house. During this time, in late 1990s-2000s, an agreement with Microsoft and the government of Egypt was put in place to get rid of illegal software downloads at the universities. Youssef and Hamdy were upset about this and started an open source software and web development endeavor; they called the company eSpace in 2001 with 10 co-founders (not the smartest move at the time).\n \nIn 2004 they got a big break — an important contract from Unilever that requested a sales automation solution. eSpace decided to do the project at cost, but was able to resell the software; this turned these hackers into a real business. During the next seven years different founders came and went as eSpace grew its reputation in open-source programming. Soon after the 2011 revolution, the government needed to communicate to the citizens about an upcoming referendum and wanted an IT company to do it for free and in two weeks. eSpace took up the job and utilized its hacker culture to complete the platform in a week, for free. eSpace then got eight more election projects from the government as they became the go-to firm for open-source technologies.\nElectronics is not just for Asia\nAt the age of 10, Waleed Khalil took a course on being an electrical technician and fell in love with electronics. In the late 1980s, Waleed would take apart electronic devices and build electronic circuit boards. After high school, Waleed went to Cairo University and studied electronics, but the courses were not interesting; what was more interesting was building products. He was so good at this many of fellow students would ask him to build their electronics graduation projects for them.\nElectronics was new to Egypt and he and a couple of students developed the electronics club, in which students with a common passion built sophisticated electronics products in their free time. This group of students had a vision, but most other students just made fun of them, calling them “Einsteins.” This particular Einstein was fortunate to meet with Ahmed Bahgat, who was the founder of a major industrial group. Ahmed gave young Waleed the large task to manage some of his major electronic manufacturing processes. He then joined a company called Metra, which wanted to design and manufacture local circuit boards in Egypt; Waleed became the factory manager and this helped him move toward his passion of building products.\nThe U.S. company Mentor Graphics then hired Waleed, and he learned how to design software. Waleed knew he was a great engineer but wanted to be a stronger business person. He was fortunate enough to receive the Yousef Jameel Scholarship and earned an MBA at the American University in Cairo. After he graduated in 2007, he started his own company, Oteena, in 2008 which became a distributor and retail consultant for electronic companies in Egypt. After visiting an R&D Center in Korea, Waleed wanted to be the first company in Egypt to design and build electronic parts and sell into Africa. So in 2010, he created Olkya, which produced flash drives and smartphones, and later designed and built the first Egyptian tablet.\nGetting the tech industry working together\nOne of my favorite quotes about leadership comes from America’s sixth president, John Quincy Adams. He said: “If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.” For the founders of the Egyptian tech sector, their leadership is shown by the future generation of business leaders they help to empower. For example, Alaa had a much bigger vision than Info Arab; it was important for him not just to build a business but an industry.\nSo in the 1980s he and a couple of other Egyptian technology founders created the Software Board, which later became the Software Association, of which he was the chair between 1996-2011. He wanted the industry to work together to demonstrate to the international market the power of Egypt’s technology sector. His vision was to get the industry to work together to present its ability to develop cutting-edge technology that would provide value to global markets.\nITWORX, the startup spin-off machine\nITWORX hired the best and wanted employees like Wael and Youssri — engineers who had a curious mind and wanted to solve the world’s problems with technology. To do this they had to create a culture more unique than most traditional Egyptian companies, a culture where it was OK to make mistakes. Engineers at ITWORX had unique opportunities developing different technologies for a diverse number of industries around the world. Whenever an employee wanted to experiment with their own business idea on the side, Wael and Youssri gave them the freedom to do this — and were even willing to give small loans when these employees left to start their own businesses.\n \nBecause of the culture, there are 48 spin-off tech companies that came from ITWORX, according to a study by Endeavor Insight. This includes Mohamed Rafea, co-founder of Bey2ollak, a crowd-based traffic app that launched during the revolution. Wael and Youssari are no longer part of ITWORX, but continue to support young founders, like Wael Amin, who is now a partner in one of the Middle East’s premier venture capital firms, Sawari Ventures.\nTech startup investor and champion\nFor more than five years on most Thursday afternoons you could find Dr. Khaled Ismail at his favorite coffee shop on the island of Zamalek mentoring a new startup. Since he sold SySDSoft to Intel he felt obligated to pay it forward and became a full-time mentor and a serious angel investor. For example, one of his investments was in young founder Mostafa Hemdan and his startup RecycloBekia, which is helping to solve the huge waste management problem in Egypt. Like ITWORX, SySDSoft has been a major source of spin-offs, with 23 tech companies being spun out. Ismail has moved from angel investor to venture capitalist and one of the founders of Algebra Ventures, which is the largest VC fund in Egypt.\nThe development of the startup hacker culture\nIn many ways, eSpace revolutionized how product development was done in Egypt. For that reason, so many of the people who leave eSpace are some of the most important parts of the startup ecosystem in Egypt. This includes Ramez Mohamed, the CEO of one of the most successful accelerators in the Middle East (Flat6Labs), and Ziad Mokhtar, who is a long-term Egyptian venture capitalist and founded Algebra Ventures with Ismail. Several startups founders were spin-offs from eSpace, like Sabrine Assem and her firm Untap, which is an innovation agency leveraging crowd sourcing.\nSuper mentor\nThere is no better mentor for startups than Waleed Khalil. For him, guiding startup helps him. “It helps your business when you help others. Good things and challenges sheds light in other areas, it doesn’t need to be the same industry or the same product. You become smarter.” About 10 of his employees have spun out different firms with Waleed’s encouragement.\nThe technology sector in Egypt has been a reliant shining light in a country that has had gray clouds since the 2011 revolution. While national GDP growth has been stagnant and only picked up in 2015, the ICT sector has been growing 13 percent per year from 2012 to 2015 and currently is the fastest growing sector in Egypt while growing employment to more than 200,000 people. This is important because Egypt has one of the highest rates of unemployed college-educated professionals in the world, and the technology sector is one of the only industries able to employ these graduates.\nThis growing and reliant industry would not have happened without the original technology founders from the 1980s and 1990s whose DNA was to solve problems with technology. They ensured their passion and DNA was downloaded to their employees and other founders they mentored. The leadership of Youssri, Wael, Alaa, Youssef, Waleed, Hamdy, Khaled and several others have to lead to the development of an industry that provides economic viability and hope to a country that has struggled to find stability over the last couple of years.", "tags": "sysdsoft,espace,egypt", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/egyptian-technology-startups-stand-on-the-shoulders-of-giants/", "id": "1531570"}, {"title": "Dharma wants to let anyone borrow a small amount of cryptocurrency", "text": "dApps, or decentralized apps, are open-source applications built on top of a blockchain. But here’s the thing – users usually can’t interact with these dApps unless they have tokens issued by these projects. For example, both Augur, a decentralized prediction market and REXMLS, a free global listing network for real estate, require tokens to interact with.\nBut if you didn’t participate in the dApp’s ICO, getting these tokens isn’t easy.\nWhile some tokens trade on exchanges, you’d have to first buy Bitcoin or Ethereum (which still isn’t necessarily easy), send it to an exchange, convert it to the token, then send to token to the dApp. It’s a process, to say the least.\nSo, enter Dharma, a company part of this summer’s Y Combinator batch.\nDharma wants to let anyone get a small cryptocurrency loan in just a few minutes, so they can use a dApp without going through that long process to acquire a token.\nRight now these loans are only denominated in ether (which some dApps accept), but eventually Dharma wants to be able to support the borrowing and lending of any crypto asset. All loans are denominated in USD so neither side is exposed to the volatility risk associated with cryptocurrencies.\nSince Dharma is built as an open-source plugin, developers can essentially plug a line of credit directly into their dApp, so users can get tokens to use without ever leaving the platform. Dharma’s protocol can also be accessed without going through a dApp at all, if someone just wanted to borrow a cryptocurrency to use for no specific purpose.\nOf course it’s a little lot more complicated than this on the backend.\nThe loans themselves are peer-to-peer, meaning Dharma isn’t actually loaning you any money – they are just building the open-source protocol to facilitate the borrowing and lending off cryptocurrency. And all loans are represented by Dharma’s own newly issued ERC20-based token, which lives on the Ethereum blockchain.\nSo how does Dharma make money?\nThe startup is also handling the credit risk assessment / loan approval process – which is the only aspect of the protocol that is not decentralized. At launch Dharma will collect basic KYC  (know your customer) information from borrowers and decide if the borrower is likely to pay back the loan.\nSince loans aren’t collateralized and there is no actual credit check, Dharma will likely limit first-time borrowers to small amounts of cryptocurrency. But over time as users generate solid repayment history they may increase the amount able to be borrowed, which is a model not so different from Affirm. In return for verifying a borrower, Dharma (the startup, not the protocol) will be allocated a certain portion of loan principal as a fee.\nRight now Dharma is the only entity that is approved to decide a borrower’s creditworthiness and approve a loan. But eventually they want to permission other entities to step in and approve borrowers – for example, an African TelCo has a lot of information on its users that Dharma doesn’t have, that could be used when deciding to approve them for a loan.\nDharma isn’t totally live yet – but you can try it out on Testnet, which is a faux version of Ethereum’s blockchain just used to test apps. On Testnet Dharma works with Metamask – a chrome plugin that lets you run Ethereum dApps right in your browser and 0x – a decentralized token exchange. But soon Dharma plans to launch on Ethereum’s live network and integrate with many more dApps.\nIf you want to learn more about Dharma, you can check out their White Paper right here.", "tags": "crpyotcurrency", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/dharma-wants-to-let-anyone-borrow-a-small-amount-of-cryptocurrency/", "id": "1534573"}, {"title": "Cowboy is a new e-bike startup from founders of Take Eat Easy", "text": "De-cloaking today is a new startup from two of the founders of defunct food delivery company Take Eat Easy.

The Durham, NC-based company today announced that it has raised a $4.3 million funding round led by Grotech Ventures, with participation from Bull City Venture Partners and Alerion Ventures.\nThe company, which was spun off from ReverbNation in 2014, plans to use the new funding to expand beyond the real estate vertical. “The first opportunity we found was in real estate, and as we work to deepen that traction, we naturally looked to adjacent verticals as well,” the company’s CEO Jed Carlson told me. “The Adwerx mission is to provide brilliantly simple digital advertising to anybody that wants to use it.”\nSome of the verticals Adwerx is currently looking at are automotive, dental practices, home services, law offices, restaurants, salons and spas. The company also offers its services in verticals like insurance and mortgage that closely align with the real estate business.\nAll of these, just like the real estate focus that gave Adwerx its start, tend to center around specific geographies and just like Adwerx already allows its real estate clients to target potential customers by zip code, these new verticals also tend to be of interest to advertisers who want to target consumers in specific geographies. Adwerx helps them create their ads and then places them on various networks, including Facebook and Google.\nAll of this may sound really familiar and Adwerx is going up against industry heavyweights that already serve all of the same verticals.

That would require a networking infrastructure to facilitate that communication, and that’s precisely what Nuco, a Toronto-based startup is trying to do with the release of the Aion blockchain network today.\nNuco CEO Matthew Spoke says that while each network is ultimately responsible for building its own level of trust within its blockchain, once you start to move outside the realm of your private blockchain as banks, governments, healthcare providers and anyone else working with this kind of data is inevitably going to do, you need a system to make that happen. Nuco built Aion to provide that mechanism.\nHe says that at its core, Aion becomes the plumbing to move data around. “[Aion provides the] middleware for blockchains to communicate with each other, and the ability to pass messages between them,” he says.\nSpoke, who along with his co-founders, were originally part of the blockchain team at Deloitte, formed the company last year to begin building enterprise blockchain infrastructure, but they began to realize that while many large organizations were building private blockchains, there was a growing need for a public mechanism. As the blockchain concept begins to scale and becomes an integral part of the economic system, it requires a generic way of moving information.\nThere are a couple of major hurdles to get people to build and use a system like this. First of all, they have to convince organizations to move information between blockchains in a public way. Second, it requires a single way to move that information, a kind of networking protocol. Once they agree to the former, the latter becomes an inevitable requirement.\nCompanies can find a way to monetize their participation on the network by charging Aion tokens, a type of digital currency, to move certain kinds of data across inter-chain bridges. This ability could lure more companies to move to the network, Spoke explained.\nThat said, he sees Aion as a market necessity, not something they are looking to commercialize in a direct way. At some point blockchain will hit mainstream adoption and it will require mature infrastructure for his company and others to succeed. Spoke says his company is making this contribution to help the market grow.\nWhile Nuco isn’t the only company working on this problem, Spoke is convinced that a process like this is required, and that like any technology, the market will decide which approach wins and becomes the standard.", "tags": "blockchains,network", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/nucos-aion-network-provides-a-way-to-communicate-between-multiple-blockchains/", "id": "1533563"}, {"title": "Expedia leads $26 million round in hospitality startup ALICE", "text": "Before Uber poached Dara Khosrowshahi to serve as its CEO, he facilitated a $26 million series B round in hotel startup ALICE as CEO of Expedia.

These range from online travel agencies, hotel booking sites and aggregators, to companies that help hotels fight back in an attempt to get more direct bookings. And of course there is Airbnb and its ilk.\nOne growing sector we can add to the travel accommodation list is long term stays for business travelers. Enter Cologne-based Homelike, founded in 2015 by Dustin Figge and Christoph Kasper. The German startup targets business travelers who need “long-stay” accommodation of a month or more and for which a hotel doesn’t really cut it. Citing growing demand from both the supply and demand side, the startup has just raised €4 million in Series A funding led by Cherry Ventures, with participation from existing backer Coparion.\n“Due to many international work assignments, Christoph and I used to work and live abroad for several months with stays in China, the U.S, and some European cities. Eventually we were both tired of staying in hotels with limited privacy and without a ‘home away from home’ feeling,” explains Figge, Homelike’s CEO.\n“Furnished apartments were more comfortable, flexible and also significantly cheaper than hotel rooms. We both liked it way more than hotels! However, it was anything but easy to find a suitable apartment and book it online from a remote location. That was the point, the idea for Homelike, and thus our business was born”.\nAs the pair began to scope out the startup’s product, Figge says it became more evident how underserved business travel is within the apartment rental market. At the same time, companies increasingly require employees to relocate temporarily as part of their work for weeks if not months on end.\n“Also companies themselves are trying to cut accommodation costs rapidly these days,” he adds. “They spend about 25 per cent of their business travel costs on overnight stays. When it comes to prolonged periods, furnished apartments are, in most cases, a 40 per cent more cost-effective solution in comparison to hotels. Including added benefits of being more comfortable and flexible. Simultaneously, the temporary housing market is growing rapidly by 20 per cent year over year and is becoming much more professional”.\nTo take advantage — and feed — this trend, Homelike offers an entirely online and “no friction” booking experience for furnished apartments for long stays. This includes a secure booking process, corporate travel policies (such as VAT invoicing), and a user experience it says is designed to cater to the needs of corporates.\nFurthermore, Figge says that apartment providers prefer Homelike because they can easily list their entire inventory online. “After the apartments have been verified based on our quality standards, the landlord can relax knowing that we take care of the whole process end-to-end, including the billing and transactional process. We are the only platform which provides a digital rental agreement that is signed by both parties, skipping the traditional process of printing and sending a paper copy back and forth,” he explains.\nMore broadly — and something that likely attracted Cherry — is that the rental market is generally shifting towards the direction of furnished and serviced living. “Similar to the shifts we are experiencing in transport and mobility, we believe that the rental market will develop towards a ‘living-as-a-service model’,” says Figge.\nFinally, I’m told there is another piece to the Homelike play: data. This is seeing the startup generate what it claims to be a significant amount of data around rental prices, the best locations, the best floor plans, etc — data it reckons will enable Homelike to vertically integrate further with developers that are building new and proprietary supply that is tailored to the business travel segment.", "tags": "cherry-ventures", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/homelike/", "id": "1533077"}, {"title": "Meet Android Oreo’s all-new emoji", "text": "The newest version of Android (Oreo, officially) doesn’t bring a ton of new stuff to the mobile operating system, but it does overhaul something near and dear to most smartphone user’s hearts: Emoji.

That’s up from around 0.3 percent of the total market.\nMarshmallow (6.0), meanwhile, has leapfrogged Lollipop (5.0/5.1), to make up just under a third of the market, at 32.3 percent, to its predecessor’s 29.2. Keep in mind, Marshmallow is a two-year-old operating system, so it’s not exactly bleeding edge, but this is certainly a step in the right direction.\n\nWe’ve already seen a fair number of O(reo)’s features, courtesy of a beta release, and, honestly, it’s not the most exciting Android update — a fact that could mean people aren’t going to be rushing to upgrade. There are still some important questions that will hopefully get answered today, however, including which devices will be the first in line to be upgraded. \nWith IFA coming up in a few weeks, we may also soon see the first devices to ship with the new Android out of the box.

While they both compete like there’s no tomorrow, they also partner on some very specific deals. For instance, Google is paying a ton of money to remain the default search engine on iOS.\nAs CNBC first reported, according to a Bernstein analyst, Google could pay as much as $3 billion a year just to remain the default option in Safari.\nBusiness Insider also obtained that Bernstein report and shared the thinking behind this number. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi starts from a previous court document from 2014 that stated that Google had to pay $1 billion every year to remain the default search engine on iOS back in 2014.\nBut mobile traffic as well as iPhone sales have been growing steadily since then. If you look at Apple’s services revenue, and in particular licensing revenue, as well as Google’s traffic acquisition costs, that number could be around $3 billion right now.\nIt shows that Google is still highly dependent from Apple. The vast majority of Google’s revenue comes from ads on search result pages. And Apple controls roughly 18 percent of the smartphone market.\nAs most users update to the latest version of iOS in just a few months, it doesn’t take long to change the default setting on hundreds of millions of iPhones. Google has no choice but to spend a ton of money to acquire this traffic.\nA few years ago, the iPhone shipped with a built-in YouTube app and Google Maps. When Apple realized that Google was becoming a serious competitor with Android, the company removed the YouTube app from iOS and worked on Apple Maps. Apple isn’t afraid of saying no to Google when it comes to iOS features.\nApple could probably not get as much money from Microsoft Bing, Yahoo Search or DuckDuckGo, but Apple doesn’t really need it anyway as it brings more than $45 billion in revenue per quarter now. It’s all about hurting Google’s bottom line.\nAs John Gruber noted, Apple is in a strong position in this negotiation. While it’s true that DuckDuckGo and Bing have gotten better over the years, it still lags behind when you’re using those search engines in non-English languages.\nThis incongruous situation is a great example of asynchronous competition. Apple and Google keep innovating and competing as hard as they can on the smartphone front. But they also partner on other aspects and even pay each other.

Pingpad released an update today to bring an organizational layer to Slack that could help teams keep their project information more orderly inside the communications tool.\n“Most companies we work with spend 80 percent of their time in Slack, but the conversational UI is a blessing and a curse,” Pingpad CEO and co-founder Ross Mayfield told TechCrunch. “Slack is great at communication, but it doesn’t support collaboration and coordination. We help you get Slack organized,” he explained.\nThe update includes a new concept called Pingpad boards, which offers a Trello-like experience for organizing projects by content type such as open items, completed tasks and shared documents. Each of these items is more than a simple to-do task. They are each full-fledged documents unto themselves. Clicking any item on the board opens an editor for adding content.\nWhile the board is separate from Slack, the work on the board is fully integrated in Slack via Pingpad Conversations.\n“Today we have Pingpad Conversations that let you have a focused conversation on a task, a decision or content you are creating, which are synced across Slack or in the PIngpad Web App,” Mayfield explained.\nThat means if you share a note created in Slack, the Pingpad bot recognizes it as a note and allows you to see more information about it, while teeing up next actions such as providing feedback about the content or even closing the item when it’s completed. All changes get synced across Slack and Pingpad automatically.\nPingpad was first released last year as a stand-alone Wiki for use with Slack. You could create documents in Pingpad and share them inside Slack, but not much more. The update provides, not only the ability to create and share underlying project documents created in Pingpad, but also additional conversational structure for projects within Slack through on-going automated integration with Pingpad and the ability to collaborate with colleagues and move projects forward.\nNot surprisingly, Mayfield doesn’t see this as additional set of activities, so much as a helper tool to make Slack users more productive. “What we are doing is helping things get done in the flow of the regular work where they are doing their work now,” he said.", "tags": "communication,collaboration,pingpad", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/pingpad-update-brings-organizational-layer-to-slack/", "id": "1539218"}, {"title": "Programmers can now access Test IO code QA service in Jira development tool", "text": "Software quality-assurance testing has sometimes taken a backseat in today’s rush-rush agile development environment. Into the breach has stepped on-demand testing startups like Test IO, giving developers easy access to a stable of qualified QA testers.\nThe company announced a new plug-in today that embeds the Test IO service directly into the Atlassian Jira development workflow tool. The tool is available in the Atlassian Marketplace.\nOnce installed, developers simply click the Test IO button directly in the Jira interface to select their testing parameters and start the workflow. The service then locates available testers who have the expertise and equipment the developer requires, Test IO CEO Philip Soffer explained.\nSoffer says they have a team of 30,000 vetted software testers, who get cross-checked by human supervisors until they reach a consistent testing level. Each person is ranked by their quality, availability and other factors. When a programmer asks for someone with a specific skill and equipment, they get routed to the most qualified person currently available online who matches the requirements. If it requires more than one skill, the testing request could get routed to multiple testers simultaneously. The idea is to get the QA completed as quickly and accurately as possible under real-world testing conditions.\nUpon completion of the review, a report with screenshots and screen cam movies showing problems is sent back immediately to the programmer with a list of problems. Developers can communicate directly with testers in the interface if they have questions about the review.\n \nGiven that 70 percent of Test IO customers are using Jira, it made sense for the company to make it as simple as possible to access the service. Without the Jira plug-in, developers would need to open their browser, go to the Test IO website, sign in, pick their testing parameters and upload the material to test. Much of that is taken care of with the embedded tool, and programmers never have to leave Jira to request testing or review the results.\nTest IO was founded in 2011 in Berlin, and still has an office there, but it’s headquartered in San Jose now.

Sometimes, these presentations are very long, with many startup teams taking the stage to pitch to investors and the media. Sometimes, they’re shorter, featuring a more concentrated group of founders. But always, the pitches are concise. In fact, most incubators or accelerators take their cue from one of the original incubators, Y Combinator, which gives each of its startups less than three minutes to dazzle the crowd.\nAs a result, what makes it into TechCrunch (and other outlets) on the heels of these demonstrations are very much first impressions of companies —  vague outlines of what’s interesting about them. Perhaps naturally, too, these first impressions are often appropriated by the companies themselves and turned into endorsements to gain traction with early customers.\nSuch is the case with Vacayo, a startup that recently passed through the 500 Startups accelerator program and which last month presented to a crowd at the Computer History Museum in San Jose, Ca., alongside 28 other startups.\nOn the heels of the event, we included Vacayo in our coverage of the event, explaining its proposal to become a kind of property manager to homeowners who have extra space (or extra homes) on their hands, property that the startup says it can furnish and find tenants to fill.\nVacayo has since used that coverage, including linking to it on Facebook, to solicit customers. The problem, as reported in a recent CNBC story, is that Vacayo is being highly deceptive in how it’s landing some those listings. For example, Vacayo founders Isabel Berney and Truth Oladapo rented the Miami Beach home of Bay Area entrepreneur and investor Drew Grewal, then listed the home on Airbnb without his permission.\nBecause of strict regulations around short-term rentals in Miami, Grewal was subsequently fined tens of thousands of dollars. After evicting the pair, Grewal tells CNBC he saw some of his furniture featured in two other Miami Beach Airbnb listings. Oladapo told CNBC that Grewal asked him to take the furniture.\nAnother Miami Beach property owner, Rula Giosmas, told CNBC she similarly had Airbnb-related problems at two of her four properties. She said in one case, she’d been led to believe she was renting the property to a couple with a child from New York. The tenants, she discovered, were Oladapo and Berney. Giosmas now plans to sell the property, which she says was turned into a “flop house,” and which has also attracted fines to the tune of $20,000.\nNeither Isabel nor Truth Oladapo responded to requests for more information from TechCrunch earlier this week. Asked about their startup, 500 Startups declined to comment.\nMaybe in an age where founders are encouraged to stretch the truth, to fake it till they make it, and to be resourceful above all else, Oladapo and Berney rationlized their approach to securing properties as unremarkable. Maybe they reasoned that as long as they were building up a client base, it wasn’t so wrong, despite the painful financial consequences their actions created for the property owners.\nWe disagree. In fact, we’re writing this post now because we don’t want potential customers to see our coverage in Vacayo’s marketing materials and interpret it as a kind of seal of approval. It is not. We do not know the company. We in no way sanction its reported approach. In fact, we found CNBC’s report fairly disturbing.\nThe truth is that we can’t really know any team that presents at a demo day. We presume that readers understand the point of these pieces: that we’re trying to bring you with us to presentations you might otherwise miss.\nWe continue to think these wrap-ups are useful, too. “It’s difficult to validate the claims a startup makes in a brief two or three minute pitch,” says TechCrunch writer John Mannes, the colleague who wrote about Vacayo. But “as long as we can keep everyone on the same page that we’re evaluating the pitches of mostly pre-seed startups, there’s still value in highlighting standouts.”\nIn the meantime, for anyone who might construe our cursory interest in a team or a technology at one of these events as anything more than that, we apologize for the confusion.", "tags": "demo-day", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/the-downside-of-writing-up-demo-days/", "id": "1538592"}, {"title": "Copycats versus disruptors in Latin America", "text": "\n\nWhen a company expands to Latin America, it requires a great deal of effort to adapt the language, operations and marketing strategies in order to find acceptance in the local market. In Spanish, the process of adapting a product or service to the local market is called “tropicalización,” or tropicalization.\nBecause tropicalization is often a significant undertaking, there are countless business models in the United States and other English-speaking markets that have not yet been fully implemented in Latin America, leaving real opportunities for startups in the region. In fact, up until now, a majority of the most successful startups coming out of Latin America have fallen under the “copycat” business model. In other words, local entrepreneurs have been the ones replicating successful business models crafted by U.S. startups and launching them locally. A few examples include MercadoLibre — the “eBay,” OLX — the “Craigslist” and Despegar — the “Expedia.”\nThe “copycat” business model has some favorable attributes. For one, startups can easily explain their concept to local investors using the well-known “Uber for X” phrasing, allowing investors to quickly identify the problem and understand how this could be a notable solution. This tends to make securing investments in a traditionally risk-adverse region a whole lot easier.\nOn the other hand, there’s been a rise in truly disruptive ideas coming out of Latin America, as well. Before going into which business model is more advantageous in the region, it is also important to point out the difference between “innovation” and “disruption.”\nCertainly, “copycat” startups can be innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors. After all, implementing an existing business model for a local market does require creativity and a serious commitment, but true disruption uproots everything consumers currently understand, how they behave and how they do business.\nAccording to Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen, “disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative.”\nIt’s worth exploring which model has been more effective in Latin America and in which way will startups continue to progress. Will they continue reshaping known business models for the Latin American market? Or, are we witnessing a steady influx of ideas that are entirely brand new? To answer that question, it’s important to first explore some of the startups born from each approach, and what the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are for entrepreneurs in Latin America.\nThe risk-averse nature of investors in Latin America has a lot to do with why so many VCs have felt much more confident investing in ideas that mimic successful companies in the U.S. or Europe. However, as the saying goes, an idea alone is not always the key to success; what matters is execution.\nReplicating an existing business model can be extremely challenging in a complex region like Latin America. In some cases, startups find adapting relatively easy. However, most of the time it can be a tough path. Nicolas Szekasy, an investor and board member of Restorando, Latin America’s “OpenTable,” argues that most copycats in the region are simply variations using the same technology. He goes on to say, “that if the companies initially appear to be copycats of their U.S. counterparts, they often adapt and adjust along the way to successfully serve the local market, and ultimately end up with very different business models.”\n\nThe true definition of a “copycat” is still very much open to interpretation. However, what really matters is that this approach does have its advantages, and, many times, Latin American startups are implementing existing ideas in a better way — or creating more value than how the original model was designed.\nTake Brazil’s Dafiti, for example. Now part of Berlin-based Rocket Internet, which is famous for applying proven ideas in other countries in emerging markets, Dafiti based its original business model off of U.S.-based Zappos and tailored the business model to fit the Latin American market. In doing so, it became quite successful in the region and joined Rocket Internet’s global fashion group, which is now valued at $1.1 billion.\nBrazilian technology-powered freight broker CargoX also found considerable success with its “Uber for trucking” business model. Brazil reportedly has an excess of between 300,000 and 350,000 vehicles, with trucks running empty 40 percent of the time. The goal of CargoX is to reduce the number of empty trucks on the highway, increase revenue for truckers and reduce costs for freight owners.\nBetween its launch in 2013 and last year, CargoX added 100,000 members, equivalent to 10 percent of self-employed truck drivers in Brazil. In a single day, the company once registered 5,000 downloads, according to the company’s CEO, Argentine Federico Vega. Fast-forward to today, and CargoX has raised an additional $10 million in Series B funding from Goldman Sachs, established a network of more than 150,000 trucks and has laid the foundation for a sustainable transportation company with great potential for expansion throughout the rest of the region.\nA few other examples of the applied business model, or “copycat” successes in the region include:\nIn today’s digital age, ideas can travel much faster than companies can. Nonetheless, what matters most is the execution of those ideas. In many of the above cases, the “copycat” approach has its definite advantages. These Latin American entrepreneurs are well aware that with the right strategies in place, they can adapt profitable business models from the U.S. and Europe to the local market and grow them quickly — with expansion and exit strategies already in place.\nEven though there are plenty of inspiring “copycat” startups in Latin America upheld by innovative founders, high valuations and millions of users, this way of thinking is not without its criticisms.\nDuring the last decade, many involved in the Latin American ecosystem have pointed out that simply copying what U.S. and European startups are doing is no longer a sustainable model. In Latin America, the majority of entrepreneurs and investors have become far too comfortable with this strategy, always looking for easy wins. However, if the region is going to partake in global innovation, then entrepreneurs and investors must start focusing more on real disruption.\nThe good news is that there are fewer and fewer copycats, as Latin America’s entrepreneurs are becoming much more aware that they must compete globally. Startups like Satellogic are evidence of this shift in thinking. The company is on a mission to develop commercial-grade satellites at an extremely low cost, for less than $100,000. The founder and CEO, Argentine Emiliano Kargieman, is a hacker at heart, with years of experience in the technology landscape.\nSatellogic is planning to launch a constellation of nanosatellites into orbit that will generate real-time images from all over the planet  —  an incredibly valuable asset for hundreds of industries. No company has attempted this before, and Satellogic’s approach has the potential to truly disrupt the satellite data market.\n\nThere are plenty of other disruptors emerging in Latin America. In fact, these companies can already be counted by the thousands and are spreading beyond the internet into new sectors like agtech, clean energy, biotechnology, digital medicine, renewable energy, software security, IoT and AI. “Latin America is witnessing the emergence and growth of a new species of companies that is transforming our business landscape,” a new report on Tecnolatinas (technology-based private companies born in the region) states. “And most of these Tecnolatinas are entrepreneur-driven, digital ventures with an international footprint.”\nSemtive, founded by a team of Argentines, is producing turbines designed for low wind speeds — unlike traditional wind farms that rely on speeds of 30 mph or greater. With the smallest model starting at $4,600 USD, the startup hopes to become the first and most affordable small wind turbine on the market for homes and businesses.\nThe Latin American agricultural technology market is expected to reach $541.8 million by 2022, and BovControl is another company disrupting “business as usual” by supporting efficient farm production using data collection techniques, cloud computing and information delivery. Founded in Brazil, where there are more cows than people, BovControl is now used on thousands of farms across the world.\nTo draw a conclusion as to which approach is better for startups in Latin America, it strongly depends on the definition of success being used. For example, success could be based on the total funding companies have raised using each approach. In this case, one could look at the most recent Latin American Venture Capital Trend Watch Report by LAVCA, which describes the top 10 venture capital deals made in 2016. Of the 10 largest deals, the majority were made in companies whose businesses appear to mimic existing models in the U.S., such as Square, Lending Club and Postmates.\nIf the definition of success is an acquisition, then of the dozen or so Latin American startups listed here that have been acquired by companies abroad since 2013, three-to-four companies could be considered truly disruptive. The other nine or more used an applied business model approach and were acquired by similar services abroad as a strategic entrance into the region.\nAnd finally, one of the more conventional ways to measure startup success is to examine valuations. Of the nine Latin American companies currently in the billion-dollar club, three are clearly using an applied business model approach and six have developed disruptive solutions.\nIt is possible to draw conclusions based on the data above, but for the most part, it remains to be seen which business model is producing the most startup successes in Latin America as the ecosystem is still relatively young when compared to other more mature ecosystems. Additionally, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages when applied in Latin America. The “copycat,” or applied business model approach, can be used to fulfill unmet needs in an existing category. For the most part, it also tends to be faster and cheaper. However, execution is key and speed matters, as companies who opt for this route often face a lot more competition.\n\nThe innovative, disruptor approach has its unique advantages in that companies can create their own category, and, therefore, are faced with less competition. And even though a disruptive approach tends to be more capital-intensive, it’s usually from this side that the world’s most visionary leaders are born. As someone who has invested in companies on both sides of the table, I can confidently say that Latin America is filled with incredibly innovative entrepreneurs creating real solutions to real problems in Latin America — and they are doing so by any means possible.\nFull disclosure: My firm, NXTP Labs, is an investor in CargoX, Properati, TiendaNube, Satellogic and Semtive.", "tags": "cargox,latin-america,latam", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/copycats-vs-disruptors-in-latin-america/", "id": "1533787"}, {"title": "A Stanford professor’s advice on surviving the a**hole at your startup", "text": "If you’ve never worked for a complete jerk, consider yourself lucky.

He authored “The No Asshole Rule” a decade ago, and, relying on academic studies and thousands of email exchanges and conversations he has had with readers since, Sutton is now publishing a follow-up book next week called “The Asshole Survival Guide.”\nWe talked with Sutton yesterday about what it means to be an asshole, how to work alongside one and why startups likely have more than their fair share of them.\nTC: You cover a lot of ground in this book, which is basically a guide to figuring out a way to survive a terrible human being based on how much power you have. Why write a second book on this particular topic?\nBS: “The No Asshole Rule” was really meant to be about building relatively jerk-free cultures, but people from all corners have been approaching me ever since, saying, “I work with a jerk. What do I do?” I sort of became the Dr. Phil for people with asshole problems.\nTC: Is this meant to mostly entertain? Is it anecdotal?\nBS: I did want it to be entertaining and readable, but I take an evidence-based perspective. I’m an organizational researcher at Stanford, so I’ve carefully reviewed thousands of economic papers on bullying and abusive workplaces.\nTC: You talk a lot about creating physical and mental distance from bullies. But I’ve interviewed one of your Stanford colleagues in the past, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who takes a very different stance. He argues that you’ve got to fight bullies or else lose to them. His thinking is that nice guys finish last.\nBS: I’ve written two books with Jeff and although he loves making that argument, he’s in the minority. My personal philosophy is that if you’re a winner and an asshole, you’re still a loser as a human being. But further, if you look at Adam Grant, who’s perhaps the most respected researcher in our field, and a host of others of us, we think if you beat people badly, you may win in the short term, but your enemies lie in wait to bring you down.\nTC: You hear that refrain a lot in startups I think — the founder who was wronged or underestimated and has an axe to grind so starts his or her own company. \nBS: Sure! Look at Tony Fadell [who worked for Steve Jobs and later co-founded Nest Labs, which Google acquired for $3.2 billion]. Getting even can be a motivation, absolutely.\nTC: You may know more about Fadell’s relationship with Jobs than I do. Maybe I should back up and ask what you mean by asshole. Is it another word for someone who’s “political” in a work setting?\nBS: The definition I use is that you’re having interactions with someone who leaves you feeling demeaned, de-energized and disrespected. It could be because they are nasty to everyone. It could be that you’re egging them on. It could also be that you’re thin-skinned. In fact, you’re right that people are often political opponents, in which case the odds that I think they are an asshole and they think I am as asshole are pretty high. But even in that situation, there are things you need to do so that your productivity and mental health don’t deteriorate.\nTC: New research suggests that it’s most often someone’s boss who they deem an asshole. Do you think that’s partly because people hate hierarchies?\nBS: If you look at research on who tends to be a workplace bully, the most frequent culprit is the person next up the hierarchy from us. The notion that people quit bosses instead of organizations is well-documented.\nThere are also studies that show when you put people in positions of power, they become more focused on their own needs than others; they become more rude. So if you’re going to pick the asshole, the most immediate culprit is someone’s immediate boss.\nTC: So you get away from that person. But to Pfeffer’s point, if you opt out, isn’t it game over?\nBS: If you’re going to work every day and someone is treating you with disrespect or you’re constantly exposed to bullying, it can lead to trouble with your family, mental health problems, sleeplessness. I think you’re a quitter and a winner if you get out of that situation. By Jeffrey’s logic, people would never divorce abusive spouses, either.\nOne thing I do emphasize is the importance of how you quit. We love the idea of the person who says, “Take this job and shove it,” but we all need our social networks. Slowly figuring out your exit options in a way that preserves those is a much better way to go about it. Unless you’re rich, like Fadell. In which case it doesn’t matter. [Laughs.]\nTC: Continuing to play devil’s advocate here, people like to think organizations care about them more than they might. Do employees sometimes mistake a focus on the bottom line for assholishness?\nBS: If you look at our biases as humans, we do overestimate how much people care about us or how important we are to others, so I think that is an issue. [With pro basketball, for example] it might lead you to label someone as an asshole if they traded you and you thought you were important. Either way, you need to change the situation.\nTC: What if you don’t have the resources to leave it?\nBS: There are a number of mind tricks that I outline in the book. One centers on temporal distance. You look for the silver lining in a situation. It’s, “Gee, that person just treated me like dirt, but when I look back on it a year from now, it won’t hurt so much.” Reframing things in such a way that they can seem funny to you helps, too.\nThere are also ways to get rid of the local asshole, but you’ll need a posse.\nTC: Before you go, do you think bullying is any worse at startups? We’ve obviously seen a lot of headlines about bad behavior this year.\nBS: If you want to talk about situations where you’re going to turn people into jerks, yes. If you put someone under a lot of time pressure, make them tired and sleep deprived, place them in a position where they feel powerful — and they felt powerless before — then potentially add physical crowding, it’s a pretty good recipe for bringing out the worst in any human being.\nIt’s frankly amazing how civilized many startups are despite the pressure they face.", "tags": "stanford", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/a-stanford-professors-advice-on-surviving-the-ahole-at-your-startup/", "id": "1537588"}, {"title": "It’s time to build our own Equifax with blackjack and crypto", "text": "The private data of 143 million Equifax “customers” is now available for download. Have no doubt: This means you will be hacked. This means your SIM card can be spoofed. This means someone will try to get into your email and online accounts. This means someone will try to open a credit card in your name. This crass, callow, and lazy treatment of our digital data cannot stand. Equifax – and every company that dumps data like an airplane toilet dumps chunks of frozen urine – must face a reckoning.\nFirst, we cannot allow our most precious data to be accessible via the last four digits of our social security number. Any new company that does this should be shut down. Once I tell a customer service representative the last four digits of my SSN – I just did it a moment ago with an insurance company and it sprang open my personal data like a cheap padlock – I’ve lost all security. That CSR can use my data. Someone can overhear my weak PIN. What’s worse, I use that PIN everywhere. Entering my SSN into a random form field on some well-meaning site means I’ve essentially written the password to most of my personal data on a busy highway overpass. These places are that insecure.\nWe must look outside the US for leadership. Estonia, for example, has already released a number of solutions to this problem including a cryptographically secure ID card. This card connects to our computers and unlocks our data. Without it no one can access our data. An even easier solution could include government-provided 2-factor ID generator. These are cheap and portable and rugged and far more secure than any static number. Further, we must also outlaw SMS two-factor authentication. In fact, thanks to the data stolen from Equifax, that process can be easily broken by (you guessed it) telling a CSR the last four digits of our Social Security Number.\nUltimately we must hold these companies accountable. Target loses your data? Don’t shop at Target. Trump Hotels dumps your credit cards for the third time in two years? Maybe AirBnB is for you. Equifax dumps your social security number? Don’t depend on their data for your products.\nWe must create new, secure methods for cryptographically securing our data. We must make it so that a hacker with a fast connection and knowledge of the tar command cannot drag our data off of a secure server.\nEquifax, for its part, has all but given up. Their security site – a site where you type in the last six digits of your SSN and your last name to see if you’ve been hacked – seems to be down and/or attacked by phishing scammers. This kind of technical incompetence is disgusting.\nMistakes happen. Unfortunately, they tend to matter more at the very organizations where time, ineptitude, and complacence have reduced data security to a tertiary concern, well under “deciding what’s for lunch” and “increasing shareholder value.” These old organizations – Equifax was founded in 1899 and hasn’t changed much since inception – must die, to be replaced by solutions that (and I shudder to say this) blockchain-based. I shudder because I know that the dangers to our data are far more expansive if we hand them over to the cryptoratii but, ultimately, this must be the way we go.\nThere is precedent for this sort of technological shift. Twenty years ago if you told a CTO that she would one day pick a homegrown operating system full of bugs and spaghetti code over Microsoft she would have laughed you out of the office. “No one gets fired for buying Microsoft,” was the old saying. Now if you recommended a Windows installation over spinning up a few Ubuntu instances on Heroku you’d be considered a madman.\nIn short, it’s time for those who are careless big data to die. It’s up to you, the entrepreneur, to offer true and viable alternatives. Because losing your personal data is awful the first time but when it happens again and again there has to be a better way.\n“There’s an old saying in Tennessee,” a wise man once said. “Fool me once, shame on you.

The deal is expected to go through, so AT&T isn’t wasting much time putting its various assets to use.\nAs before when it rolled out free HBO to Unlimited Plus customers, AT&T is also sweetening this new deal by offering a $25 monthly video credit for Unlimited Choice customers that can be used towards any applicable AT&T video service, including its streaming service for cord cutters, DirecTV Now, as well as DirecTV and U-Verse TV.\nWith the $25 credit, that means AT&T customers can basically add on over-the-top streaming TV for $10 per month, as DirecTV Now’s plans begin at $35 per month. The fine print, however, notes that the credit starts within three billing cycles, so don’t expect it right away.\nCustomers with an existing AT&T video service will have HBO added for no extra charge to their existing plan, while current HBO subscribers will just no longer have to pay, the announcement explains. For those who don’t subscribe to HBO through an AT&T video service, they’ll be able to access HBO through the DirecTV Now and HBO GO applications.\nThe new offer comes shortly after rival T-Mobile said it would begin giving away free Netflix to its unlimited data family plans, as both carriers try to find an angle to promote their unlimited plans in the wake of Verizon’s [disclosure: TechCrunch parent, by way of AOL] decision to throttle video in its own unlimited plan.", "tags": "wireless,time-warner,hbo,att", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/att-expands-free-hbo-to-both-its-unlimited-wireless-plans/", "id": "1539246"}, {"title": "How to watch the live stream for today’s Apple iPhone keynote", "text": "Apple is holding a keynote today at the brand new Steve Jobs Theater on Apple Campus, and the company is expected to unveil new iPhone models, a new Apple Watch as well as a new Apple TV.

It means that Apple is about to unveil a new iPhone. But this year is going to be different as the company should unveil not one, not two but three different models. There should be a new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as well as a mysterious iPhone X. There were many leaks already, but some details are still unclear.

That’s why it’s testing a new feature called Instant Videos that downloads and caches Facebook videos to your phone while you’re on Wi-Fi so you can watch them later on the go for free. Users will see lightning bolt icons on pre-loaded videos.\nThe Instant Video feature is reminiscent of Instant Articles, Facebook’s hosted content format that loads much faster than mobile websites so users don’t drop off waiting for a publisher’s articles to appear. Because videos load even slower than web pages, publishers might be keen to get involved to ensure maximum viewability for their clips.\nThe feature could also benefit Facebook’s new Watch tab of original video content, allowing it to cache episodes so people could watch them on a train or elsewhere that they might not have a strong connection or want to use up their data plan watching longer-form videos.\nFacebook confirms to TechCrunch that the Instant Video test is available to a small percentage of Android users. A screenshot of Instant Videos was first shared by “Devesh Logendran” using a pseudonym to TNW’s director of social media Matt Navarra. Now we’ve confirmed with Facebook that the goal is to remove data costs as a barrier to watching its videos.\nPreviously, Facebook has tried to adapt its service for differing bandwidth and data prices by re-ranking News Feed to prioritize low file-size content while downranking videos if you’re on a slow connection, or replaying stories you’d already seen.\nWhile Instant Articles has mostly focused on the speed and convenience of reading news on Facebook, Instant Video focuses on the cost and accessibility. That could make the feature a major boon to Facebook’s efforts in the developing world. There, mobile data prices can be quite high compared to average incomes, and spotty network connections can make watching video frustrating.\nBut if Facebook wants to be the social network of tomorrow, not just today, it knows it must whole-heartedly embrace video, which can deliver more vivid entertainment and interpersonal connection than text or photos. Interaction with mobile video is skyrocketing, according to a NewsWhip study shared by eMarketer showing a massive 53 percent year-over-year increase in engagement with news outlet videos on Instagram.\nVideo also carries lucrative advertisements that are closer to the television commercials that brands are accustomed to making. Getting people accustomed to watching organic videos can make them more receptive to watching video ads. Plus, Facebook is starting to allow video creators and publishers to insert video ad breaks into the middle of their clips, and splits the revenue, with 55 percent going to the creator. Instant Videos could potentially include these ad breaks.\nBy testing Instant Videos on Android, Facebook is laying the groundwork for both serving the developing world where iPhones are more rare, and more budget-conscious teens in the developed world. Combining forward-thinking accessibility initiatives with its engineering prowess and ubiquity could help Facebook excel beyond YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter and other competitors that also see video as the future.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/facebook-instant-video/", "id": "1539045"}, {"title": "When modern day innovators begin to stray", "text": "\n\nMore than two decades ago, Qualcomm unveiled a baseband processor that enabled the earliest cell phones to connect with the cellular network. This was a big breakthrough, both for the consumers who quickly embraced the technology and for Qualcomm, which held a patent on the technology and consequently established an immense revenue stream from the growing cellular market.\nBut, as often happens when control over a powerful technology is vested in a single entity, Qualcomm has wielded its baseband processor patent in anticompetitive ways to protect its revenue stream. Though Qualcomm’s baseband processor is still a part of cellular phones, it’s a small component relative to the massive computing power and additional features of today’s smartphones.\nNevertheless, Qualcomm is leveraging this essential patent to distort the market for new smartphones by forcing companies that need to license the technology into paying unfair licensing fees and blocking competitors from any size from getting into the business.\nEarlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took an important step toward addressing this anticompetitive behavior, filing a lawsuit to investigate Qualcomm’s licensing practice. Just this past month, a federal court in California rejected Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing the case to proceed.\nBetween the ongoing FTC lawsuit and a finding last year from the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) that Qualcomm’s unfair licensing practices warranted a fine of nearly $1 billion, it appears that competition regulators are beginning to take seriously longstanding complaints about Qualcomm’s behavior.\nAt issue are Qualcomm’s control of Standards Essential Patents (SEPs). As new technologies develop, industry-wide organizations often create standards that manufacturers can follow to ensure interoperability and promote efficiency. When a standard includes a patented technology that is deemed essential for conforming to the standard (an SEP), the patent holder must license the patent under terms that are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (aka “FRAND”). FRAND licensing ensures that industry benefits from consistent production standards while allowing the patent holder to retain control of and profit from the essential patent.\nBut, because SEP owners control such valuable resources, they occasionally try to capitalize on this strong position by ignoring FRAND obligations or otherwise using their SEPs to reap outsized profits, such as when Qualcomm has refused to license its baseband processor patent to competitors, or when it demanded that mobile phone manufacturers agree to unreasonable licensing terms in exchange for access to the patented technology.\nDespite scrutiny from the FTC, KFTC and other competition authorities around the world regarding its unfair licensing practices, Qualcomm has indicated that it intends to double down on these questionable business activities to distort competition in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT). Considering the vast economic potential of the IoT sector, the consequences of this anticompetitive behavior should concern companies and consumers alike.\nIt appears likely that small innovators will have an outsized role in developing the IoT market, with venture investors putting more than $1 billion into IoT startups in 2016.  According to Gartner, Inc., a leading information technology research and advisory company, “makers and startups, not tech providers, consumer goods companies or enterprises, will drive acceptance, use and growth in the IoT through the creation of a multitude of niche applications.”\nIf Qualcomm exports its anticompetitive licensing model into the IoT sector, this incredible economic potential will be at serious risk. Unfortunately for startups, investors and consumers, Qualcomm has already begun to push its IP might in IoT, joining forces last September with Ericsson, ZTE and Royal KPN to license its patents to “automakers, creators of smart meters, and others,” through a new company called Avanci.\n\nWhen Avanci was announced, the company’s leaders, “stressed that the pricing will be based on FRAND terms and the rates will be made public.” But if history is any indicator, potential licensees should be concerned that FRAND terms will not be available without a fight — if reasonable terms are available at all. As other commenters have noted, this consortium is “far from the new start the IoT needs,” since “the companies behind Avanci are all traditional mobile players with significant patent portfolios to protect and monetize.”\nStartup activity in the mobile and IoT sectors depends on fair licenses for SEPs. Regulators must keep a watchful eye on bad actors to ensure that innovators are not precluded from bringing products, services, apps and new innovations to market simply because large players can leverage IP rights to box out potential competition.\nThe FTC lawsuit provides an opportunity to address unfair licensing practices and set the stage for more open innovation in developing sectors. Now that the case is set to proceed, we look forward to an open debate on the best path forward for both license holders and license seekers. We should strive to limit barriers to open competition like unreasonable patent licensing practices in order to allow the next generation of startups and entrepreneurs to build upon the innovations of the past.", "tags": "zte,ericsson,qualcomm", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/when-modern-day-innovators-begin-to-stray/", "id": "1538817"}, {"title": "Twitter has an unlaunched tweetstorm feature", "text": "Subverting the 140 character limit by chaining tweets together into a cohesive “tweetstorm” takes some know-how, or you’ll screw it up. Luckily Twitter has built but not yet launched a feature for easily composing tweetstorms. Hidden inside the current Android app is a way to write out a tweetstorm and see it broken into distinct tweets, then tweet them all at once.\nBy institutionalizing tweetstorms with a graphic user interface, Twitter could make sharing expanded thoughts more accessible to everyone. Whether it’s telling a suspenseful story, stringing together breaking news facts, or going on a long-winded rant that should have been a blog post, tweetstorms let you distribute deeper and more nuanced content.\nUnder the pseudonym Devesh Logendran, a Twitter user passed on their sighting of the tweetstorm feature to TNW’s Director of social media Matt Navarra. Twitter told us “No comment to share on the record” when we asked about the feature that refers to tweetstorms as “threads”. We have no additional information on if or when this feature will ever launch, but have learned that it’s not currently available for public testing.\nPopularized by tech investor Marc Andreessen, coined by fellow VC Chris Dixon, and vilified by BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel, tweetstorms have been a Twitter power user trick since at least 2014.\nTypically, you need to know to reply to you previous tweet one at a time to build a tweetstorm, not just tweet separately or reply the first tweet. A lot of people make these mistakes, causing their storms to get broken up in the timeline.\nWhether making tweetstorms easier is good for the information density and consumption trends of Twitter is up for debate.\nSome think you should either condense your thoughts into a tweet or two, or right a separate blog post and link to it. Others think the serialized format can offer a special reading experience and reach a wider audience than an offsite blog. Either way, the Twitter sorting algorithm deemphasizes content with weak feedback, so if tweetstormers are boring their audience, they’ll pay the price in visibility.\n\nBut one of Twitter’s core problems is that it doesn’t feel approachable for the average joes and janes, leading to its weak user growth the last few years. Seeing tweetstorms and not understanding how they work, or messing up when you try yourself can discourage people from sticking with the app.\nTwitter’s already made a wise push to simplify itself in other ways, like dropping media embeds or usernames in replies from the character count.

Since these expectations are set, there typically aren’t any real surprises Apple could come out with that would force Wall Street to reassess the future of the company, and thus send the stock swinging upward or downward.\nThis is actually one of Apple’s biggest challenges and, in recent quarters, is often cited on conference calls for the companies’ quarterly earnings reports. Leaks for the next-generation iPhone are more prolific than ever. Given that the upcoming iPhone may end up having significant updates and changes, it would make sense that it would generate enough of a hype aura to get people to hold off on purchasing phones in the near term.\nStill, just by reviewing what’s happened in recent years, you don’t see any significant stock swings following each event. Let’s go back through some of the previous years, starting with the 2013 iPhone 5S announcement:\n\nThe iPhone 5S was an incremental update to the iPhone 5 and, as we’ve come to expect, we knew a lot about the phone before Tim Cook actually went on stage and kicked off the event to unveil the phone. Now, let’s take a look at 2014, the last massive revision to the iPhone:\n\nAnd then 2015, the incremental update to the iPhone 6 with the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus:\n\nAnd, finally, here’s last year’s launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus:\n\nThe trend is normally pretty similar: there might be a small shift on the actual day of the event of a few percentage points, which is maybe followed by an extended euphoria period as Wall Street starts to come in with estimates of iPhone sales and their projections for the third quarter. Then, there’s a bit of a hangover period as the company starts to march toward its earnings report, which is typically where the real fireworks happen.\nThis is more or less a similar sentiment to what Wall Street has, which is tracking the same reports and is looking at the same tea leaves the average consumer is in order to divine where to value Apple as it heads into the fourth quarter. But in this case, the surprise last quarter was that Apple forecast a quarter that was a bit above what everyone expected — and, hence, would theoretically deliver the new iPhone on time.\nThat’s why the release date is going to be critical for the iPhone. Apple came out with some numbers that made Wall Street rethink what the company is going to do in the third quarter and the kind of results they expect to see. If that ends up not fitting the model, then they have to change the model, and then we’ll see a shift.\nThat’s now baked into the anticipation around the Apple event. New cameras are great, faster processors are also nice, but at this moment it seems there are few surprises that might come out about the actual guts of the device. Instead, most eyes will be on that date that Apple puts on screen for when consumers can finally begin ordering the new iPhone, and when it will begin shipping.\nApple had to constantly grapple with intense consumer demand for Plus models of the iPhone as consumer demand for larger phones seemed to far outstrip what everyone thought. Every week the shipments get pushed back is another week that consumers are going to have to wait, and it’s another week that the price tag will seem even more ominous if it ends up higher than what they are typically paying when they purchase a new iPhone.\nSo, don’t hold your breath for anything other than the final launch date (and maybe the price) of the iPhone X if you’re looking for something insane to happen on Wall Street.

Including an incoming animated poo-moji, pictured in still 3D form above.\nThere’s also a GIF of a few others in action…\nIt says the Animoji will use facial tracking and the user’s voice to create expressive animated messages. So augmented emoji messaging here we come.\n9to5Mac has also unearthed a bunch of new and rather retrotastic-looking still wallpapers incoming — and for a couple of these Apple appears to be getting perilously close to recreating the ZX Spectrum logo.\nI mean, spot the difference…\nIncoming iOS 11 wallpaper:\n\nYe olde ZX Spectrum logos (as seen via a Google search):\n\n[Insert: Thinking emoji face right here… ]\nMoving on, a camera-related feature apparently coming to the new premium priced iPhone model is a Portrait Lighting mode for creating “dSLR-like shots”, as 9to5Mac terms it, using depth by simulating different lighting effects.\n9to5Mac notes there’s support for Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light, Stage Light Mono, and Studio Light evident in the leaked build, and suggests the mode enhancement could be related to the flash when shooting.\nIt’s also found new video recording resolutions and capture speeds:\nPer prior rumors, the iPhone 8 is expected to see Apple switch from LCD displays to OLED — and 9to5Mac says it’s seeing evidence the OLED iPhone will feature a True Tone Display for white balancing like the iPad Pro lineup. While it reckons the new resolution will be 1125×2436 based on this firmware.\nThe firmware also includes further references to the new iPhone screen design with the distinctive top notch — first revealed back in July, via the release of firmware for Apple’s forthcoming HomePod Siri speaker.\nOne of these new reference images apparently shows an SOS mode that can be triggered by pressing what looks like the power and upper volume keys on either side of the iPhone at the same time.\n\nIt says there’s also a clue that the power button will play a larger role for interacting with iOS now that Apple is ditching the home button on the OLED iPhone — per earlier rumors.\nSo, for example, double-clicking the side button (as this key is now apparently being called) will show Apple Pay cards and passes, as is the case on the Apple Watch. 9to5Mac says you can also press and hold it to invoke Siri. Which does make me wonder whether you’ll have to talk to Siri every time you want to turn your top-of-the-range iPhone off.\nThe side button method is also apparently tied to new Accessibility settings for adjusting the speed of the double and triple click, enabling Type to Siri, and even using Face ID (more on the latter below).\nInstead of a home button at the base of the screen, the new premium iPhone 8 is also rumored to be getting a dynamic area/status bar at the bottom of its near bezel-less display.\nAnd this firmware leak appears to confirm the change — with this region being denoted by a line at the bottom of apps:\n\n \nThe earlier HomePod speaker firmware leak also confirmed rumors that Cupertino is bringing a facial recognition feature for unlocking the device to the iPhone 8.\nNow, 9to5Mac has found a video tutorial for setting up the face unlock feature, which appears to show that users will be guided through capturing their visage — starting with a full frontal and then tilting to the sides, up around and down…\nIt reckons the face unlock feature, which is codenamed Pearl ID in the leaked firmware, will be officially called Face ID in Apple’s marketing.\nLast but not least: As well as iPhone tidbids, 9to5Mac says the iOS 11 GM has leaked what looks to be an image of the new LTE Apple Watch Series 3, which sports a red spot on the digital crown — presumably to help it stand out from existing, non-cellular Apple Watch models.\n\nFor further proof, it’s also found a watchOS screenshot of Control Center with a cellular signal indicator (as well as the ‘notch’ OLED iPhone icon).\nOther references suggest the watch will share the same phone number as the connected iPhone, as you’d expect. And there are indications some carriers intend to offer promotional plans for the device.\nElsewhere on the other hardware front, 9to5Mac has unearthed what it reckons is a minor tweak coming to AirPods, with a revised version number (1.1 to 1.2) and a video suggesting Apple is moving the charging indicator light from insight to the front of the device so you don’t have to pop it open to check if your earbuds are juiced up yet.\nIt says it’s still digging through the firmware so may have more tidbits to detail.

TechCrunch has discovered code in Facebook’s ad manager that lets businesses buy ads with the call to action “Send WhatsApp Message.”\nWe reached out for comment and a WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch “We’re testing a new way for people to start a chat with a business in WhatsApp from a Facebook ad. This makes it easier for people to connect with businesses that they care about on WhatsApp.” They clarified that for now, WhatsApp isn’t selling ads on its own app, but testing a WhatsApp chat button on Facebook ads that directly opens a conversation with a business in WhatsApp.\nThe Next Web’s Matt Navarra initially spotted the WhatsApp name in Facebook’s ad manager code, in a way that didn’t describe how the ads work. Upon further investigation, TechCrunch found this “Send WhatsApp Message” code.\n\nThis week WhatsApp announced its plan to eventually charge businesses, stirring worries that businesses might be able to cold-message users with sponsored message ads. But WhatsApp tells TechCrunch that businesses will only be able to contact WhatsApp users that have agreed to be messaged by initiating the conversation. That’s the same way Facebook Messenger-sponsored messages work, where businesses can pay to reconnect with people they’re already chatting with.\nSo, a business could use the tested Facebook ads feature to get users to spark conversations with their company, and then have the ability to contact them in the future, potentially through sponsored messages. For example, an e-commerce business could buy Facebook ads that start a conversation with its style consulting service on WhatsApp, then later message that user with promotions for new clothing lines.\nThis was the first way Facebook Messenger began monetizing in 2015 though “Click-To-Message” ads that lived on Facebook proper. Messenger eventually began injecting display ads into the inbox, which WhatsApp could one day allow, too.

Today, the company announced it’s expanding the technology to mobile, initially on select Android devices, but not yet on iOS. With support for HDR, videos offer better picture quality, with higher contrast that allows you to see more vibrant colors and make out more of the image in darker scenes.\nAt launch, YouTube mobile HDR is rolling out to Pixel, LG V30, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note8 and Sony Experia XZ Premium devices, through the YouTube mobile app.\nThe company says it will continue to work with mobile industry partners to bring HDR playback to more devices over time. The plan is to support new HDR capable devices as they enter the market. (YouTube’s HDR requires VP9 Profile 2.)\nWhen HDR first launched on YouTube, it was only being used by select YouTube channels, including those like MysteryGuitarMan, Jacob + Katie Schwarz and Abandon Visuals.\nThe technology is still not broadly adopted, but YouTube today points to a few other resources for finding HDR quality videos, including on Youtube.com/4K or HDR shelf, as well as in videos such as Venice Carnival in 4K HDR 60P (UHD), The Redwoods | Shot on Epic-W with HELIUM 8K S35 Sensor 8K HDR, and Peru 8K HDR 60FPS (FUHD).\n\nHDR is still an up-and-coming technology, in terms of TVs. Though there are plenty of HDR TVs to choose from, most consumers don’t upgrade their television set that often. In other words, when something like 4K or HDR hits, it could be years before it reaches the masses.\nRight now, it seems that HDR TV sets will surpass 4K sets, with shipments reaching 245 million units by 2022.\nHowever, making HDR video available via mobile could broaden its adoption, given that many consumers already have these devices in hand, and phones are swapped out on a more frequent basis.\nFollowing the launch of HDR, YouTube has been working with creators who want to take advantage of the technology. It made HDR recording gear and post-production facilities available in some of its YouTube Spaces, including New York, L.A., London, and Tokyo. In addition, all YouTube spaces have cameras capable of capturing the requisite dynamic range and RAW/Log format to take advantage of HDR.\nYouTube also tells us it’s looking to upgrade Rio and Paris to HDR-capable post production facilities next, and those upgrades should be complete next year.\nGoogle had also previously made it possible to stream HDR content to TVs via its Chromecast Ultra device.\nYouTube mobile HDR is rolling out now to the supported devices.\n", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/youtube-launches-hdr-playback-on-select-mobile-devices/", "id": "1538046"}, {"title": "Zelle, the U.S. banks’ Venmo rival, will launch its mobile app next week", "text": "Zelle, the PayPal rival backed by more than 30 U.S. banks, is preparing to launch its standalone mobile app on Tuesday, September 12th. The move is meant to give the U.S. banking industry a foothold in the person-to-person payments business, where they’re losing ground to services like PayPal, Venmo, Square Cash and, very soon, Apple’s iMessage, powered by Apple Pay.\nWhile banks have always offered the ability to do instant transfers, the process to date has been more cumbersome. Users would need to have details like a friend’s account number and routing information, for example. That led to the birth of alternative means of sending money, like today’s payment apps where you only need to know information like a username, phone number or email.\nSimilarly, Zelle’s new app will allow users to send and request money to and from their contacts, using only their phone number or email. It also will work with U.S. Visa and MasterCard bank debit cards, even if the user’s bank is not yet participating in Zelle’s payment network.\nThat network has been in the works since 2011, when Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase first teamed up to work on a digital payments solution that would allow their customers to send money to each other through a joint venture then called clearXchange. The consortium dragged its feet, but last year picked up momentum and rebranded to the consumer-friendly “Zelle.”\n\nThis June, Zelle announced it would become available within the mobile banking apps of participating financial institutions. So far, 13 banks and credit unions added support for Zelle in their own mobile apps, and 17 more have plans to connect with Zelle, according to Early Warning Services, the big bank-led consortium that operates Zelle’s network.\nSince that rollout, Zelle says the supported banks and credit unions have seen up to 300 percent increases in new customer enrollments, and an average of more than 50,000 new customers are now enrolling with Zelle daily. The larger plan is to bring Zelle to the 86 million mobile banking consumers in the U.S.\nIn the new app available on Monday, Zelle users will be able to send instant funds to one another for free, provided both are signed up for Zelle.\nIf the recipient doesn’t have access to Zelle through their bank or credit union, however, transactions will take between 1 and 3 days to complete. But unlike PayPal and Venmo, the transfers hit the other person’s bank account more immediately — there’s no final “transfer to bank” step the recipient has to take to have access to the funds.\n\nThe Zelle network already has a sizable user base making instant payments. In the first half of this year, the banks connected through Early Warning handled 100 million instant payments, totaling $33.6 billion — largely before Zelle became available.\nHowever, Venmo processed $17.6 billion in mobile payments last year, and is increasing that number. In Q2, Venmo saw $8 billion in transactions, or twice as much as the same time last year. And for the first half of the year, Venmo totaled $14.8 billion in payments.\nPayPal, which also owns Venmo, has been working to counter the Zelle threat. It announced in June that it’s also bringing instant bank transfers to PayPal and Venmo, but will charge a flat $0.25 fee for the option. So far, only PayPal has gone live with the new feature.\nCorrection: app launches on Tuesday, not Monday. apologies for the error. ", "tags": "payments,zelle,venmo", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/zelle-the-u-s-banks-venmo-rival-will-launch-its-mobile-app-on-monday/", "id": "1537907"}, {"title": "Here’s how RED’s holographic smartphone display will work", "text": "\n\nCinematic camera maker RED has a smartphone on the way – the Hydrogen, which boasts a great video camera as well as a “holographic display” that we know relatively little about, despite MKBHD getting some hands-on time with the phone ahead of its release. Now, we know more because RED CEO Jim Jannard named HP Labs spin-out Leia Inc. as the display tech partner (via Engadget).\nLeia’s technology works using light field technology, which stacks LCDs with backlights pointing in different directions. When you combine the angles of the backlight projecting the images on screen, you can produce 3D effects visible by the naked eye. Leia’s innovation is making this work while also keeping the traditional 2D display capabilities undisturbed, so that you can switch between both modes depending on what you’re viewing.\nThe major hangup for content viewable on the holographic screen might be on the content side, however – Jannard said that the smartphone will use a holographic format called .h4v to render 4D content on the screen. Creators can shoot 4 cameras simultaneously from different angles to capture these playable holographs, which seems like a steep requirement for amateurs, or by converting traditionally captured 2D or 3D content, though converting 2D content is quite difficult.\nAt the very least, this doesn’t sound like it will be quite as gimmicky as the holographic screen on Amazon’s Fire phone, which offered very little in the way of ‘wow’ factor.

This somewhat nudges Fitbit beyond just fitness tracking into something that’s more in the vein of health tracking in general. Starting in 2018, the Fitbit Ionic will show users data from a Dexcom G5 mobile sensor. It’s a collaboration that’s aimed at developing and marketing products to better manage diabetes.\nFitbit is well known for its fitness trackers, but increasingly there’s been a proliferation of trackers that focus on all areas of health. The Apple Watch is trying to move further into something that’s broader than simply fitness, and there are startups like Proof looking to pick away little niches like tracking blood alcohol content. The sum of all these little niches may end up as a comprehensive health tracking device, though cramming them all into one piece of hardware may prove more challenging than initially expected.\nIt’s a nice jump and a reprieve from a pretty ho-hum month for Fitbit, which has seen a slight bump in its performance.\n\nStill, any sign of life that alters the calculus of the kind of business Fitbit can build means there’s likely going to be a big stock price swing like we’re seeing today.

Luckily, a new type of sensor developed for DARPA uses none at all until the thing it’s built to detect happens to show up. That means it can sit for years without so much as a battery top-up.\nThe idea is that you could put a few of these things in, say, the miles of tunnels underneath a decommissioned nuclear power plant or a mining complex, but not have to wire them all for electricity. But as soon as something appears, it’s seen and transmitted immediately. The power requirements would have to be almost nil, of course, which is why DARPA called the program Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operation.\n\t\nThe sensor is built to detect infrared light waves, invisible to our eyes but still abundant from heat sources like people, cars, fires, and so on. But as long as none are present, it is completely powered off.\nBut when a ray does appear, it strikes a surface is covered in tiny patches that magnify its effect. Plasmons are a sort of special behavior of conducting material, which in this case respond to the IR waves by heating up.\n“The energy from the IR source heats the sensing elements which, in turn, causes physical movement of key sensor components,” wrote DARPA’s program manager, Troy Olsson, in a blog post. “These motions result in the mechanical closing of otherwise open circuit elements, thereby leading to signals that the target IR signature has been detected.”\nThink of it like a paddle in a well. It can sit there for years without doing a thing, but as soon as someone drops a pebble into the well, it hits the paddle, which spins and turns a crank, which pulls a string, which raises a flag at the well-owner’s house. Except, as Olsson further explains, it’s a little more sophisticated.\n“The technology features multiple sensing elements—each tuned to absorb a specific IR wavelength,” he wrote. “Together, these combine into complex logic circuits capable of analyzing IR spectrums, which opens the way for these sensors to not only detect IR energy in the environment but to specify if that energy derives from a fire, vehicle, person or some other IR source.”\nThe “unlimited duration of operation for unattended sensors deployed to detect infrequent but time-critical events,” as the researchers describe it, could have plenty of applications beyond security, of course: imagine popping a few of these all over the forests to monitor the movements of herds, or in space to catch rare cosmic events.\nThe tech is described in a paper published today in Nature Nanotechnology.", "tags": "darpa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/this-tiny-sensor-could-sleep-for-years-between-detection-events/", "id": "1539117"}, {"title": "The Jammy is a steel string guitar that fits in a pocket", "text": "As a fan of electronic guitars — as opposed to plain-old electrics — the Jammy seems like a very interesting piece of kit.

That’s why it’s not surprising to learn that Apple has been working on a new device for a while. This weekend, an upcoming build of iOS 11 for the next iPhone was leaked and contains a ton of information about unreleased products, including the next Apple TV.\nA previous leak of the HomePod firmware already indicated that Apple was working on an Apple TV with 4K video support. The new device could also support various high-dynamic range standards, such as Dolby Vision, HDR10 and Hybrid Log-Gamma. The company could announce 4K videos on the iTunes Store as well as in the Netflix app.\nAnd now, Steve Troughton-Smith discovered some of the technical specs of the next Apple TV. According to him, the media player is going to receive a major performance gain with a lot more computing power and RAM:\nApple first shipped the A10 with the iPhone 7 last year. The A10X is an updated version of this chip optimized for the most recent iPad Pro. It’s a surprisingly fast system-on-a-chip. It’s sometimes even faster than a MacBook.\nThe current Apple TV sports an A8 system-on-a-chip, the one that was developed for the iPhone 6. It’s a bit hard to grasp Apple’s progress when it comes to silicon. According to Geekbench, when you compare the A10X with the A8, the A10X is 1.7 times faster for single-core tasks, 2.8 times faster for multi-core tasks and 5.7 times faster for Metal-focused, GPU-intensive tasks. It’s a huge improvement overall.\nThis upgrade in particular is going to feel great when you’re trying to stream 4K videos. Skipping forward and backward should feel snappy. And your videos will never buffer, even if you’re trying to play 4K videos with 60 frames per second (the new iPhones should let you shoot 4K videos with 60 FPS).\nIn addition to a faster system-on-a-chip, Apple could also include 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB. This way, you’ll be able to cache a good chunk of the movie or TV show you’re currently streaming.\nApple could announce the new Apple TV as early as tomorrow during its annual September press conference.

New research might lead to a method that combines the best of both worlds.\nThe main problem with magnetic storage is that it tends to require a charged coil that must physically move to the location on the disk that it needs to write to and directly switch the direction of magnetization. Solid state storage lets the file system write to anywhere in its many gigabytes instantly. It’s like the difference between writing down an address and driving to it.\nBut if magnetic storage could be stored as addressable cells, it would be quick to write but would maintain its 1 or 0 status indefinitely. That’s what the researchers at ETH Zurich are attempting to do — and have done, at least with a single cell.\nInstead of having a coil touch a magnetic medium, a tiny cobalt dot 500 nanometers wide sits near a platinum wire. When electricity flows through the wire, stray electrons with spin opposite that of the cobalt accumulate at the edge, and eventually cause the whole dot to flip its magnetic orientation.\nThe team demonstrated this back in 2011 but just published a new paper showing how fast this whole thing happens — they watched it by blasting it with a scanning microscopic x-ray machine, which is pretty awesome. Turns out the whole bit flipping process takes less than one nanosecond.\nNot only that, but they flipped it back and forth trillion (!) times at 20 million times per second, and observed nothing suggesting the effect was weakening or becoming unreliable.\nThey plan to make it even faster and work with a smaller current, and possibly change the shape of the dot — for all they know, a square might flip faster than a circle. My guess is that they’re putting off the really hard part, which is putting billions of these things in a huge, addressable array. Not much use storing a single 0 or 1 — I can do that with a coin.\nUltimately this or a technology like it could lead to instantly writable but enduring storage that requires no power to keep its data intact; it could be used as RAM or long term storage, assuming it gets cheap enough to use for either.

Apparently Salesforce is too, because the first part of today’s announcement involves a few specific types of weather data integration on the Salesforce Lightning platform.\nFor starters, there is a Lightning component called Weather Focus, which allows developers to build weather data into applications. For example, a customer building an ecommerce app on Salesforce could automatically adjust the delivery date of a purchase based on weather conditions.\nSecondly, Weather Recorder lets users record weather data by date range directly into a Salesforce record. This could come in handy, for example, for an insurance app to incorporate information about a catastrophic weather event and help underwriters understand the conditions at the time of the claim.\nFinally, with the Scheduling Assistant you can set up appointments based on weather data, making sure there isn’t say a snow storm in the forecast that could keep you from showing up.\nThe second part of today’s announcement is about incorporating Salesforce data into IBM apps. Just as you can build weather data into Salesforce apps, you can also incorporate Salesforce data into IBM apps now via IBM Cloud Integration for Salesforce. This could be useful for pulling Salesforce data together with news and other relevant data to enable salespeople to react more quickly to customer needs based on a variety of external conditions (including the weather).\nWhen you hear that IBM and Salesforce are partnering, you might do a double take — who and who? The two companies couldn’t be more different. IBM is over a century old and has experienced more than a few significant business shifts in its time. Salesforce is a youngster by comparison, born as cloud company in the late 1990s to take on establishment companies like IBM.\nBut the two organizations have the enterprise in common, and chances are they have customers who want to use data from one another.

When a financial services application needs to link to your bank account in a secure fashion, there’s a good chance it could be using Plaid’s tools. The company can also track transactions, verify identity, check your balance and verify income.\nThe new Link SDK for enterprise announced today enables enterprise developers with no financial services background to build similar functionality into any application. Given that there are lots of scenarios where it would be useful to link an app to a bank account, having a simple and secure way to do that lets the developers concentrate on their own expertise.\nAPIs are making it easy for developers to layer a variety of different tools inside an application without having to have the expertise to build it from scratch. It’s a common approach. Stripe does it for payments. Okta does it for identity. Box does it for content services and Twilio does it for communications, as a few examples.\nIf you’ve ever been to a hackathon, you see how powerful this approach can be.

As usual, there’s a massive number of updates here, but the core theme is that the various development teams have focused on making OpenStack more composable, so that companies can more easily pick and choose the features they want. In addition, the community has renewed its focus on helping OpenStack operators manage the lifecycle of the various OpenStack tools with services like Kubernetes and Ansible.\nMark Collier, the OpenStack Foundation’s COO, and Lauren Sell, the organization’s VP of Marketing and Community Services, told me earlier this week that they are now seeing a number of emerging use cases for OpenStack. One of these is edge computing — a trend that Microsoft, Amazon and other public cloud providers are also now addressing. “There is a huge demand for cloud computing in many different forms,” Collier said. “That’s impacting what we’re doing.” Some of the most prominent companies that are now looking at using OpenStack for their edge computing solution include Verizon (TechCrunch’s corporate overlords), Walmart (which wants to do computing right in its stores) and Inmarsat (which is looking at using OpenStack to power the on-board computing power on large ships).\n\nCollier and Sell also noted that in their view, multi-cloud is becoming a standard operating model now and that many of the businesses the organization is talking to aren’t just looking at using multiple public clouds for their workloads but are also operating private clouds. “One piece of this, too, is that it’s also not that binary — it’s not private or public,” Sell said. “It’s becoming much more of a spectrum.”\nWhy the trend toward private clouds? Collier and Sell argue that it’s about cost, capabilities and compliance. Indeed, I’ve now heard from a number of enterprises that are moving to private clouds because their steady workloads aren’t a good fit for the public cloud billing model, which gives you a lot of flexibility to turn servers on and off, but you pay a premium for that. For workloads that run close to 24/7, operating a private cloud can often be more affordable.\nFor many companies, a private cloud also gives them access to capabilities that aren’t available in the public cloud. That may be specific networking functions for the many telecoms that operate OpenStack deployments, or specific hardware for machine learning workloads. For others, operating a private cloud isn’t even optional, especially if they have to fulfill certain regulatory and data sovereignty requirements.\nCollier also noted there’s a trend toward having third-party vendors like RackSpace, Canonical or Mirantis operate these private clouds, which in his view means that the companies are getting the best of both worlds: the cost-savings and capabilities of a private cloud combined with the ease of use of public clouds.\nOpenStack also is seeing massive growth in interest in China. Some of the largest enterprises there run OpenStack clouds, including the country’s largest railway system, China UnionPay, China Mobile, Huawei and ZTE. It’s also worth noting that Tencent’s massively popular WeChat service runs at least partially on OpenStack. This momentum is creating a new local startup ecosystem of companies that want to support these users.\nLooking ahead, Collier and Sell noted that the organization is now looking at how the project can better support new use cases like edge computing and machine learning.", "tags": "edge-computing,enterprise,open-source,openstack", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/openstack-sees-new-use-cases-in-edge-computing-and-fast-growing-interest-in-china/", "id": "1533149"}, {"title": "Salesforce is using AI to democratize SQL so anyone can query databases in natural language", "text": "SQL is about as easy as it gets in the world of programming, and yet its learning curve is still steep enough to prevent many people from interacting with relational databases. Salesforce’s AI research team took it upon itself to explore how machine learning might be able to open doors for those without knowledge of SQL.\nTheir recent paper, Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language using Reinforcement Learning, builds on sequence to sequence models typically employed in machine translation. A reinforcement learning twist allowed the team to obtain promising results translating natural language database queries into SQL.\nIn practice this means that you could simply ask who the winningest team in college football is and an appropriate database could be automatically queried to tell you that it is in fact the University of Michigan.\n“We don’t actually have just one way of writing a query the correct way,” Victor Zhong, one of the Salesforce researchers who worked on the project, explained to me in an interview. “If I give a natural language question, there might be two or three ways to write the query. We use reinforcement learning to encourage use of queries that obtain same result.”\n\nYou can imagine how machine translation problems can quickly become massively complex with large vocabularies. The more you can limit the number of possible translations for each missing word, the simpler your problem becomes. To this avail, Salesforce opted to limit its vocabulary to words used in database labels, the words in the question being asked and the words typically used in SQL queries.\nThe idea of democratizing SQL isn’t new. Startups like ClearGraph, which was recently acquired by Tableau, have made it their business to open up data with English rather than SQL.\n“Some models perform execution on a database itself,” added Zhong. “But there’s potential privacy concerns if you’re asking a question about Social Security numbers.”\nOutside of the paper itself, Salesforce’s biggest contribution here comes in the form of the WikiSQL data set it constructed to aid in building its model. First HTML tables were collected from Wikipedia. These tables became the basis for randomly generated SQL queries. These queries were used to form questions that were then passed off to humans for paraphrasing over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each paraphrasing was verified twice with additional human guidance.

Perhaps that’s why Okta, the cloud identity company that went public earlier this year, announced that it’s making 2FA the standard for all its customers.\nThey made the announcement at their annual Oktane customer conference today.\nResearch suggests that a large number of breaches are related to stolen or weak passwords. There is actually a black market on the so-called Dark Web where hackers can buy stolen credentials. This point is exacerbated by the fact that too many people tend to use the same password across sites, so if you get caught up in one high-profile hack — and given the sheer number of them, it’s entirely likely — chances are, that password is out there waiting to be used on your company’s network.\nOkta recognizes that, so it’s implementing 2FA as a standard, presenting every user with a one-time passcode to add another layer of protection that will be harder for hackers to surface. What’s more, the company also sees the password reuse problem so it’s adding a compromised password detection tool, which can find commonly-used passwords from large, publicly-known data breaches and warn users if they are using them.\nIt’s certainly a big step forward, and while 2FA isn’t a panacea, Joe Diamond, who runs security for Okta says it’s still better than just a username and password because it’s adding that additional layer of protection.\nThe company is also announcing a new set of APIs to make it easier to build Okta identity management into apps. The APIs provide a way to extend the market for the service without explicitly signing up to use it.\nIn this case Okta becomes the identity layer in an app in the same way that Twilio lets you add communications capabilities or Stripe enables you to add payments. This takes the complexity of implementing identity management, something every app should have, out of the hands of a developer, who probably lacks the expertise to build in identity well.\nDevelopers win because they greatly simplify identity management, while Okta gains a new revenue stream. Pricing is based on how many active monthly users you have.\nOkta went public in April. The stock price closed at $23.51 on the first day of trading.

That tells you how interconnected this industry is. It’s so intertwined, in fact, that we can trace this deal to seven moves that began back in 1998 when VMware was formed.\nHere we go:\n1 Diane Greene helped launch VMware in 1998\nIn the beginning Diane Greene helped launch VMware and it was good. The company went onto to transform IT by becoming the standard for virtual machines in the data center. EMC bought VMware in 2003.\n2 VMware launches Cloud Foundry in 2011\nThree years after Greene departed from the company in 2008, VMware created Cloud Foundry, the open source Platform as a Service.\n3 EMC and VMware create Pivotal to commercialize Cloud Foundry in 2013\nIn 2012, EMC bought Pivotal Labs, a company focused on helping customers develop the agile methodology. In 2013, EMC and VMware launched Pivotal (along with GE as a limited partner) and handed off the commercial Cloud Foundry business to Pivotal.\n4 Google developed Kubernetes in 2014\nA year later in 2014, Google released the first version of Kubernetes, which went onto to become a popular open source container orchestration engine.\n5 Diane Greene joined Google Cloud in 2015\nIn December 2015, Google bought a startup called Bebop and with it brought one of the company’s founders, none other than Diane Greene, to run Google Cloud.\n6 Diane Greene hired Sam Ramji from the Cloud Foundry Foundation in 2016\nA year later Greene brought in Sam Ramji, who was CEO at Cloud Foundry, who then became VP of product management under Greene.\n7 VMware partnered with Pivotal and Google in 2017\nJust today, the three companies came together to form a partnership around containers, but the groundwork of a partnership had its genesis in the web of relationships that formed long before that.\nAnd if you want to see another layer, consider that Dell bought EMC last year for $67 billion, and with it brought VMware and Pivotal into the fold.\n__\nSo why does this all matter beyond highlighting incestuousness in Silicon Valley? Regardless of the fact that these people and companies are familiar with one another, there still needs to be a business benefit for customers and the companies involved, or they aren’t going to come together no matter how friendly they happen to be.\nThe fact is that Google is looking to gain deeper entre into the enterprise. VMware is key to this. VMware is looking for a way into the cloud and this gives them cachet with Google, while Pivotal is looking for more companies to use Cloud Foundry. If companies like Google and VMware are pushing it, it creates momentum that would be harder to get on its own.\nFriendships are nice, and they probably helped make the partnership happen, but it will take business success for the partnership to continue and thrive.", "tags": "dell-emc,pivotal,vmware,google-cloud-platform", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/seven-moves-that-led-to-the-vmware-pivotal-google-partnership/", "id": "1532400"}, {"title": "Pivotal-VMware-Google forge container partnership", "text": "Pivotal, VMware and Google have teamed up on a containerization project that the companies say should simplify creating, deploying and managing container projects at scale.\nThe companies are taking what is a set of open-source products and providing a commercial underpinning with the various parties in the partnership bringing the product to market. Google will sell it as part of the Google Cloud Platform. Pivotal and VMware will have their sales teams selling it, and Dell-EMC (which owns Pivotal and VMware) could be selling it with their hardware offerings in a package.\nLet’s start by breaking down the roles here: Google brings Kubernetes to the table, the open-source container orchestration tool. Pivotal adds the Platform as a Service piece with Cloud Foundry and VMware adds a management layer to pull it all together.\nPivotal gets the naming rights as it’s called Pivotal Container Service. That’s PKS for short, because I guess they don’t understand the concept of an acronym. Regardless, the companies have banded together to deliver “production-ready Kubernetes” on VMware vSphere and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with ensured ongoing compatibility with Google Container Engine, which you guessed it, has the acronym GKE. ¯(ツ)/¯\nThe product is actually based on Kubo, an open-source container management product created by Google and Pivotal. With PKS, the idea is to provide a familiar container development environment on Cloud Foundry for developers used to working with Kubernetes.\nVMware is the underlying management layer that allows operations to deploy containers and manage the entire container lifecycle. When you put it all together, this becomes an enterprise-class container creation, deployment and management system.\nGoogle Cloud VP of product marketing Sam Ramji says when he was running the Cloud Foundry Foundation before coming to Google last year, he was already seeing Cloud Foundry as the easiest way to get containers into production, and they were thinking about how to get it to work with Kubernetes even then.\nMeanwhile, James Waters from Pivotal was seeing many large customers using Google Cloud tools with Pivotal tools and the need for Kubernetes in the tool kit became readily apparent as it grew in popularity.\nAs for VMware, Sanjay Poonen says they were seeing large customers thinking about containers with Cloud Foundry as a container development environment just as Kubernetes was gaining momentum as the container orchestration engine.\nAll of that, combined with the interconnections between the three companies, put them on a course to build this new product together.

After all, we’re talking about one company that dominates virtual machines on-prem, and the other in the public cloud. Together, the two companies make a powerful combination — and VMware made the whole shebang official today at VMworld when it announced that VMware Cloud was live on AWS.\nWhile AWS runs its own VMs, it’s not the same as those that VMware runs in a data center, and that creates a management headache for companies trying to run both. By letting companies move to AWS and continue to run the VMware VMs in the public cloud, they get the best of both worlds without the management problems.\nIt should be a boon to both companies, a fact that wasn’t lost on VMWare CEO Pat Gelsinger or AWS CEO Andy Jassy. “VMware Cloud on AWS gives customers a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud that delivers the same architecture, capabilities and operational experience across both their vSphere-based on-premises environment and AWS,” Gelsinger said in a statement.\nJassy added, “The majority of the world’s enterprises have virtualized their data centers with VMware, and now these customers can easily move applications between their on-premises environments and AWS without having to purchase any new hardware, rewrite their applications, or modify their operations.”\nAll of this is good news for IT pros, who have struggled to make the two systems work together. That generally meant they would could put new applications in the cloud, but struggled to move legacy applications from VMware to the AWS VMs. That obstacle is removed with this alliance.\nThis partnership is a huge lift for VMware as a company. While they boast almost 100 percent penetration in on-prem data centers, the company has struggled over the last five years to find its place as customers began to shift workloads to the cloud. This gives them a way to integrate with AWS, the giant in the public cloud, and work smoothly across both environments.\nAs for AWS, it’s a case of the rich getting richer. It gets all of the public cloud business it was getting anyway, while also getting the VMware business as it moves to the cloud. Any way you slice it, this is a win-win-win. Both companies get a big boost, and so do the customers who get a product that makes it easier to integrate VMware VMs in the AWS cloud.

This showed that VMware finally understood that the best way forward wasn’t to try and forge its own public cloud product, which it tried and failed, or to fight the public cloud. It was a recognition that most established enterprise companies were probably not going to be all on-prem or all in the public cloud, but a mix of the two for some time into the future.\nToday’s announcements at VMworld are about extending that strategy and offering customers a stack of tools to help manage their hybrid cloud world. The partnerships with the public vendors last year were a big part of laying the groundwork for what they presenting today.\nThe approach could work, at least for the foreseeable future as the industry shift to cloud computing has happened much more slowly than many (including me) would have anticipated. Companies working in a hybrid world face a myriad of challenges around areas like networking, security and policy management across environments, says Chris Wolf, CTO at VMware, and his company is lining up to help with a set of products designed to manage the complexity of a hybrid approach.\nThis includes the new VMware Discover product, which is designed to give IT insight into all of the applications and services being used across the company with the idea of providing some control over what’s happening across its networks and in the public cloud (with or without its knowledge). This could be used in conjunction with VMware Cost Insight to more closely monitor the costs of these services.\nIn addition, there is a new security product called VMware AppDefense, which is designed to help understand the normal state of the network, then report on anomalous behavior. There is a cloud-based network monitoring tool called VMware Network Insight that helps set consistent network and security policies across applications in the public cloud and on-prem, while VMware NSX Cloud is a cloud service for managing traffic across the public clouds and a software defined data center. Finally, the company has an analytics service to supply detailed insight into performance across environments.\nWhile none of these tools are ground-breaking by any means, they give VMware a comprehensive set of solutions for customers to manage their hybrid environments, and continue the shift from their core virtual machine roots.\nKeep in mind, they are hardly alone in coming up with this approach.

As the volume of content has increased, the ability to manage it all seems to have eluded us. Ironic, since Content Management Systems were supposed to solve the enterprise content organization problem.\nThe paradox was that the more content you collected, the harder it was to manage. AI and machine learning have the power to change that because machine learning algorithms actually work better with more data, and that has the potential to fundamentally alter how we think about managing content.\nThat could be why Box CEO Aaron Levie thinks AI could have a bigger impact on content management than even cloud computing did a decade ago. “I think it’s going to be more fundamental than the cloud in terms of its impact across all enterprise software, but specifically in our space, cloud content management.” He believes that’s precisely because of the exponential increase in the amount of data that is being created and shared internally and externally today by organizations of all sizes.\n“The only way we are going to be able to make sense of all this data and to extract more and more value from it is through machine learning and artificial intelligence. There is simply no other way to keep up with the growing [deluge] of data, as well as the use cases around this content,” he said.\nPerhaps it’s not a coincidence that just this month, Box announced a partnership with Google to bring AI via image recognition technology to the cloud content management firm. Specifically, it adds intelligence by auto-tagging pictures at upload and capturing any text within the pictures, making easier to identify and find pictures later on without human intervention.\n“We looked at what problem could we first solve with AI. Within Box we have 30 billion files now, and a significant portion of those are image files, and so we wanted something that instantly was going to create a tremendous amount of value for our customers. That’s why we decided to work with Google on the computer vision service,” Levie explained.\nBox also announced a deepening partnership with Microsoft in June and suggested that it could include taking advantage of Azure AI and machine learning algorithms.\nAt the time, Jeetu Patel, Box’s SVP of Platform and chief strategy officer, told TechCrunch the very nature of content management was about to shift in a significant way. “In the next five years, the way people engage and interact with content will be completely different than the last 25 years with new ways to engage and extract meaning [from content]…” Patel said.\nLast week, M-Files, a hybrid content management solution, announced it was acquiring Apprento, a Canadian startup that uses natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) to provide semantically based intelligent summaries. Greg Milliken, SVP of Marketing at M-Files, says the Apprento purchase gives them an immediate way to process unstructured data in an intelligent way.\n“In Apprento’s case, we were first attracted to their practical experience with applying natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) to practical business needs. For instance, analyzing the language used in emails and other unstructured documents and content to establish context and intent, such as relationships to accounts, projects and cases, ultimately making them easy to find when they are most relevant and needed.”\nAll of these moves suggest that we could be in the midst of an industry shift that Levie and Patel alluded to, as content management firms try to use intelligence to make sense of the increasingly large amount of content moving into the enterprise.\nAlan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, who has been covering this industry for many years, sees AI having great utility. “It’s finding its way into content management in many different ways — content analytics, automated governance, but maybe most interesting through RPA (Robotic Process Automation). RPA is far from sexy, but it can have an immediate impact on the bottom line so it’s important,” he said.\nHe says the moves by M-Files and Box are probably just the beginning and we should expect to see more partnership and acquisition action as companies take a deeper dive into AI. “I see many acquisitions and partnerships happening over the next year or two with [companies seeking] AI specialists for particular needs. Box is partnering, but I don’t think that rules out acquisitions (though they tend to buy small) to use the learning and automation technologies in different parts of their platforms — and similarly for different [types of] customers,” he said.\nFor his part, Levie says that his company will pursue whatever course seems to make the most sense, developing in-house when needed and partnering when a viable solution already exists, as it did with Google’s computer vision technology. (He did not discuss acquisition strategy.)\nTony Byrne, founder and principal analyst at Real Story Group, who is usually skeptical about developing tech trends, is actually bullish about using AI in content management — but not without some caveats. He cautions that the usefulness of your AI effort is going to be related to the condition of your data.\n“Those sorts of automation and cognitive services typically depend on a fairly organized repository of tagged (and ideally structured) content, which is often what you’re working towards in an ECM project in any case. The challenge comes for customers who have very messy repositories: AI/ML isn’t going to clean it up for them, and [these companies] will struggle to draw meaningful conclusions — garbage in — garbage out,” Byrne explained.\nPelz-Sharpe agrees with this assessment. “Most enterprises have poorly managed data/files — unintegrated applications and are typically (intentionally or not) out of compliance. AI promises to figure that out for you. In reality, though AI is itself limited in what it can do due to this poor state of affairs,” he said.\nByrne also warned that it’s early days and it’s going to take some time to get this right. “Customers just need to understand that software vendors themselves are still thinking in terms of potential and have not yet fully activated AI/ML services as specific applications. That means that [customers] today will need to do a lot of the experimentation and testing themselves. But I think it’s worth exploring, especially for sizable enterprises with more complex needs around large-scale document processing, knowledge management, records management and search tuning,” he said.\nThat is good advice for any developing technology, but especially worth keeping in mind with the unique needs of content management. That means finding areas where it would work best such as Box’s choice of image recognition. Over time, as AI improves and gets more deeply incorporated into CMS tech, we will begin to see more complex use cases.\nLevie acknowledged that a lot of this technology will likely be applied to future content, rather than large legacy stores, but that shouldn’t minimize the impact this is going to have on the industry moving forward.\nAs AI and machine learning evolve, it makes sense that content management is going to play a role in that. Humans have never been terribly skillful at organizing massive volumes of data — and it turns out, machines are amazingly adept at it. As we have begun to see with other forms of enterprise software like CRM, AI is transforming the entire way we think about software.\n“We think we are on the cusp of, for the first time, where technology can actually work on behalf of the user. I don’t have to tell it to do all of the things I want to generate value from. The system itself can begin to generate that value on its own, and that’s a pretty significant turning point for technology,” Levie said.\nThis ability could allow us to finally fulfill the promise of managing and controlling large volumes of content. “It finally introduces the promise that the industry has been talking about for a couple of decades. It has never been about the storage and archiving and strict management of the content. It’s always been about how do you make sense of and create more value from your information, but unfortunately, we’ve never actually had the technology to be able to accomplish that ultimate vision…until now,” Levie aptly explained.", "tags": "aaron-levie,content-management-systems", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/26/ai-will-fundamentally-change-how-we-manage-content/", "id": "1531721"}, {"title": "Descartes Labs raises $30 million Series B for its brand of geospatial analytics", "text": "Descartes Labs is announcing a $30 million Series B this morning in a large round led by March Capital. This comes just three months after one of Descartes’ largest competitors, Orbital Insight, closed its own $50 million Series C with Sequoia.\nBoth Descartes and Orbital are playing in the emerging market of geospatial analytics. These companies use machine learning to produce insights from satellite imagery and other data. This capability has proved exceedingly popular with hedge funds where images of store parking lots, for example, can be used to project out revenue numbers. But companies running the gamut from agriculture to logistics see the value in having an extra pair of trained eyes in the sky.\nMost of Descartes previous investors participated in today’s growth round. Crosslink Capital and Cultivian Sandbox participated though Data Collective did not. The company previously raised $8.3 million in funding.\nRight out of the gate, one of the more unique things about Descartes is that it is headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Co-founder Mark Johnson pitched Santa Fe to me as a place where an engineer and his or her family can actually buy a house. Today’s raise is one of the largest in the history of New Mexico.\n“Our original founding thesis was that lots of money was going to satellite hardware but not to the equivalent software,” Johnson explained to me in an interview.\nIn the three years since, more money than ever has been spent on geospatial software technologies. Johnson noted the number of startups he meets on a weekly basis trying to do interesting things combining deep learning and the myriad of images taken from different satellites every day continues to grow.\nAs Descartes’ internal data pipelines have been getting more and more robust, talk has slowly shifted to opening up the platform to a wider audience. Everyone in the space knows that the real money will be made through massive SaaS contracts and not through one-off consulting contracts.\nThe hope is that Descartes can open up all of its technology in an easy to use way such that customers can search across the globe. Geovisual Search was an initial crack at this — implementing computer vision to quantify physical infrastructure. With this tool, you can search for wastewater treatment plants or cargo ships and automatically count and identify them.\nThe biggest challenge is getting companies into a position where they can get the most out of using Descartes’ platform. Extracting data, cleaning it and thinking about data science methodologies isn’t always the easiest thing to do. This is the main reason that Descartes is prioritizing accessibility.\nToday the startup has 40 employees. Johnson is looking to grow the team to around 50 or 60 by the end of the year and 100 next year. Much of this hiring will happen in product and sales. The team is toying with the idea of increasing the number of verticalized offerings — in the near future you could hypothetically see a dedicated platform for agriculture with built-in land use classifications.", "tags": "orbital-insight,orbit,descartes-labs,philosophy", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/descartes-labs-raises-30-million-series-b-for-its-brand-of-geospatial-analytics/", "id": "1531111"}, {"title": "Marketo picks Google Cloud to migrate from on-prem data centers", "text": "Google got a much-needed win today when Marketo, the marketing automation platform, chose Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to migrate its entire on-prem operation.\nThe partnership will extend beyond hosting with Google also providing deeper integration with GSuite.

Beyond simply personalizing their channel to make it more engaging to fans, the extensions in some cases will help streamers generate additional revenue.\nIn particular, one extension called “Gear on Amazon” allows Twitch creators to show off their favorite Amazon products. If a viewer clicks through to purchase, the creator will earn a commission through the Amazon Associates program.\n\nThis extension will be available to both Twitch Partners and Affiliates, and is the first time that Twitch’s streamers have been invited to join the program, even though Amazon owns Twitch. To create their list of suggested products, streamers will be able to sign up as an Amazon Affiliate, then browse the Amazon catalog and pick their favorite products, right from their Twitch dashboard, the company says.\nThis follows another recent move from Amazon to help video creators make money by promoting Amazon products, as it turns out. Last week, Amazon opened up its social media “Influencers” program to YouTube stars, allowing video creators to build their own curated shop, with its own short and memorable URL. It only makes sense that Amazon would enable something similar for its Twitch streamers, as well.\n“When it comes to helping creators monetize through product recommendations, it’s important\nto make these features easy to discover and intuitive to use,” said Piers Heaton-Armstrong, VP\nfor Affiliate Marketing at Amazon, in a statement. “Gear on Amazon achieves that by simplifying both the process for signing up to be an Amazon Associate and by making it so creators can showcase the actual products they are using and wanting to promote,” he said.\n\nHowever, the Amazon extension is only one of many that will be available at launch. There are currently over 20 extensions available, including some game-specific ones like OP.gg forLeague of Legends by OP.gg, Innkeeper: Interactive Hearth Overlay by Curse, andMasterOverwatch by Master Network.\nOthers are designed for more general use, like Streamlabs’ Loyalty, Music, Polls & Games, or Muxy’s Overlay and Leaderboard, for example.\nA full list of the new extensions is available on the Twitch blog here. A sample showcase is below.\nTwitch is also opening up the extension platform broadly to third-party developers, via its Developer Portal, dev.twtich.tv. Developers will receive free asset hosting and fanout messaging to make it easier to get started, the company says. Completed extensions are then shown to creators in a new Extension Manager.\nAt launch, extensions will be free, but Twitch tells us that monetization details are soon to come. More information about this will be announced at Twitch’s developer conference, TwitchCon’s Developer Day next month.\nTwitch had planned to make the extensions available to streamers tonight, but that’s been pushed back at the last minute.

Initially, the feature will allow desktop and mobile web users to view Stories posted by their friends and others they follow. But it in the months ahead, the web version will allow you to post to Stories, too.\nInstagram Stories has been only one of an array of attacks on rival Snapchat – along with a dedicated app for teens, Facebook Stories, Messenger Day, and more. But it’s the one that stuck. Today, the feature alone is used by over 250 million Instagram users every day, while Snapchat reports it has grown its total user base to a lesser 173 million daily users.\nThough there’s been some backlash about the “Stories” format showing up everywhere these days – from Facebook to Skype and even on dating apps – on Instagram, it makes more sense. The photo-based social network is already about using visual communication as a means of connecting with friends.\n\nAnd with Stories, Instagram has efficiently copied some of Snapchat’s best party tricks, including augmented reality filters, face filters, sticker packs, ephemeral messaging, and more.\nAs in the mobile app, Instagram Stories will appear at the top of the page when viewed on the web. You can click into a Story to view it, then tap on the small arrow icons to advance or go back.\nThe move to bring Stories to the web may seem relatively minor, but it broadens access to the feature, including in developing markets. Over 80% of Instagram’s base is outside the U.S., the company notes. And this expanded reach, in turn, impacts Instagram’s bottom line.\nInstagram today is home to a number of businesses who want to market to consumers through their own Instagram accounts and ads, and one in five Instagram Stories posted by a business received a Direct Message reply. That could make it appealing to advertisers who want to reach customers through more private channels.\nInstagram says that Stories on the web is rolling out starting today, but the process won’t complete for weeks.

It also says that when a story is marked as disputed, the link can can no longer be promoted through Facebook ads.\nThe next step, which the company is announcing today, involves stopping Pages that regularly share these stories from buying any Facebook ads at all, regardless of whether or not the ad includes a disputed link.\nFacebook was criticized last year for its role in helping to spread of fake/false news. (The company is using the term “false news” for now — “fake news” has become heavily politicized and almost meaningless.) Product Director Rob Leathern said the company has been trying to fight back in three ways — ending the economic incentive to post false news stories, slowing the spread of those stories and helping people make more informed decisions when they see a false story.\nIn this case, Leathern said blocking ad-buying is meant to change the economic incentives. Facebook is concerned that “there are Pages posting this information that are using Facebook Ads to build audiences” to spread false news. By changing the ad policy, Facebook makes it harder for companies to attract that audience.\nFacebook isn’t specifying the exact numbers of disputed links a Page can share before it gets blocked — after all, the company doesn’t want people to try to game the system — but Leathern said, “Obviously, it’s not a single instance. It’s a repeated pattern of misinformation.”\nHe also noted that the ban on buying ads isn’t necessarily permanent.

There have been specific controversies, like the debate over Facebook’s role in spreading fake news (which the company has been doing more to fight), as well as a broader conversation around what responsibility Facebook has toward its 2 billion users.\nOne of the ways Facebook has tried to open up about these issues is through a series of blog posts around “Hard Questions,” like how Facebook addresses hate speech and what happens to people’s profiles after they die.\nThese posts are usually written by Facebook employees, but a spokesperson told me Spayd has been working for the past few weeks to help with Hard Questions and potentially to bring that same approach to transparency to other parts of the company.\nIn some ways, Spayd might seem perfect for that role — as The Times’ public editor,  she served as a sort of intermediary between readers and the newsroom. However, her columns were often controversial. Slate’s Will Oremus probably did the best job of laying out the case against her, arguing that she was “squandering the most important watchdog job in journalism” by parroting journalistic platitudes and reader complaints without thoughtful analysis.\nSpayd turned out to be the last public editor at The Times, at least for now — the position was eliminated as part of larger editorial cuts.\nBeyond her work as public editor, Spayd has a long journalistic résumé, including serving as editor of the Columbia Journalism Review and managing editor of the Washington Post. Her hiring was first reported by Recode.", "tags": "liz-spayd", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/facebook-hires-liz-spayd/", "id": "1531732"}, {"title": "Facebook adds new ways to revisit your memories and milestones", "text": "Facebook today is expanding on the popularity of its two-year old “On This Day” sharing prompt, with the addition of new features that let users revisit their memories, as well as celebrate milestones related to their friendships on the social network. While “On This Day” provides a look back in time, starting with memories from the same day last year, two new options will instead focus on your more recent memories.\nThe company will now begin to bundle your past posts into monthly or seasonal sharing prompts. For example, you might see recap stories for things like your summer memories or your January memories.\nLike “On This Day,” these new sharing prompts are private to you, unless you choose to post them to your Facebook profile. They’ll also appear in your News Feed, where you’ll see the collection of photos Facebook has picked for you along with the “Share” button below.\nThe recap feature arrives at a time when Facebook is struggling with consumer adoption of its Snapchat Stories clone, which unlike Instagram Stories, has not taken off. Facebook even began showing grayed-out images of friends’ photos earlier this year in Stories, in an effort to increase usage.\nFacebook believes that Stories is simply a new sharing format that every network will eventually offer. However, many people think of Facebook as a more permanent record of life events, thanks to its ability surface old memories, search or scroll back through timelines to see historic personal moments, like the date you got married, started a new job, moved to a new home, and so on.\nThat’s why a recap feature makes more sense for Facebook, as opposed to the recency associated with Stories. It’s a better fit for a network that’s encouraged people from day one to document what matters in their lives, not what’s disposable.\n\nIn addition to this, Facebook is also today launching new friendship milestones. While the social network already allows users to celebrate their friendship anniversaries on Facebook with playful posts and videos, these new moments will focus on notable achievements – like when the number of friends you have hits a nice, round number like 100, or when your posts have been liked 1,000 times, for instance.\nThese messages are shown only to you, and are oddly not shareable at launch. However, Facebook says that will change in the future.\nMeanwhile, “On this Day” is now finally available to all on Facebook, the company also says. Facebook has improved its filtering process to keep those memories associated with negative events or feelings from popping up in its suggestions, it notes.\n\nFeatures like these are minor updates in the grand scheme of things, but they have a larger goal: to keep users posting to Facebook.\nLast year, there were reports detailing how Facebook sharing – specifically “organic sharing,” meaning personal updates –  was in decline.

The social network just rolled out a set of new “family” emoji that, while they don’t yet capture the full spectrum, at least let your partner and kids have something other than yellow skin.\nIt’s live right now in the desktop and mobile site — but not Messenger, which for some reason uses different emoji, or the mobile app. All you have to do is pull down the emoji menu, then do a long click on the family emoji — your options should appear above the default yellow-skinned emoji.\nSo why did this take so long? Well, standards take a while to set, and the UTF standard for modifying the skin color of emoji had to be developed and agreed upon. And once that happens, it’s up to platforms how they want to implement that standard.\nIn this case, it was Microsoft that jumped on the possibility of diverse family emoji first — more than a year ago. But see if you can spot the difference between the ones above and Microsoft’s:\nYeah — diversity is complicated! Families frequently aren’t all black, all brown, or all yellow. Reflecting real diversity in families is different from doing so with individuals. And the encoding process is different, too.\n\t\nThere’s an existing code grammar for this, but it isn’t well supported — if you saw one of their complex families on other platforms, it wouldn’t render properly. Instead it shows as a sequence of each person in the family — actually a rather graceful failure.\nAnyway, back to Facebook. They’re all about ease of use, and having 52,000 options pop up in the emoji menu isn’t a good user experience. So for now the social network opted to keep things monochrome in a fashion, though less monochrome than they were before.

Social media influencers could apply to the program by filling out an online form.\nThese applications were vetted, as Amazon considered factors like the size of the influencer’s online following, fan engagement on their posts, quality of content, and relevancy for Amazon, among other things.\nThe idea with the program is to allow Amazon to better tap into social media’s power to drive sales. Today’s influencers regularly promote products they like in their online postings, including YouTube videos – often either as part of a brand relationship or as a means of generating income through affiliate sales. Amazon wants to now insert itself more directly into that action.\nAn Amazon spokesperson confirmed the program’s further opening in a statement to TechCrunch:\n“We recently enabled a self-service tool for YouTube influencers only to be able to sign up for the Amazon Influencer program,” they said.\n\nThe new tool is aimed specifically at YouTubers who want to have their channel vetted by Amazon. After clicking “Get Started,” applicants are walked a few steps where they have to verify their social identity and eligibility. The tool states that a YouTube account is required to join, but other ways to qualify will be added in the future.\nThe program also has a refreshed website with a more polished look alongside some basic details on how the program works.\n\nAccording to the website, Amazon Influencers will get their own customizable page on Amazon, including a vanity URL they can share where their product recommendations are featured. When customers shop their page, the influencer will earn a commission on qualifying purchases.\nThe page explains, too, that the program is an expansion of the online Amazon Associates program for social media influencers, as it’s offering a new way to direct traffic to Amazon to boost sales.\nEarly program participants include popular YouTube channel What’s Up Moms, Mark Cuban, and Felicia Day, according to the Influencer homepage. (Amazon will not disclose how many beta participants the program has signed up to date.)\n\nAs it falls under the Amazon Affiliate Program, the Influencer Program is not necessarily offering higher commissions – it’s simply making it easier to send customers to Amazon to shop the product recommendations.\nKey to this program is that vanity URL, which is meant to be something short and memorable.\nAmazon notes it’s “especially useful when promoted verbally or in an environment where linking is not possible.” In other words, it could easily be mentioned in a YouTube video while the product being promoted is discussed.\nThis is not the first time Amazon has tried to use video to drive sales. It had launched its own watch-and-shop online show called “Style Code” last year, but it didn’t pan out. The show was canceled in May. However, with the Influencer Program, Amazon can effectively turn YouTube stars into sellers, also much like a modern-day HSN or QVC.\nWhile the debut of the self-serve tool seems to imply the program has now fully launched, we understand that’s not the case. The program is still considered to be in “beta” for the vast majority of people trying to sign up, as their applications will be vetted manually by Amazon staff.\nAmazon also intends this program to extend beyond YouTube. The retailer aims to offer support to influencers across all major social networks, which should include the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nIt’s unclear how this program may tie into Amazon Spark, the retailer’s recently launched Instagram-like service, however. On Spark, Prime members can post photos of products they like and other ideas for all to see.

However a new report surveying the current status of legislation pertaining to the retention of communications data across the region has found that many of the EU’s 28 members are not adhering to what privacy rights advocacy organization Privacy International describes as the “basic standard”.\nIt’s urging all EU Member States to review their national legislation and amend it where necessary to come into compliance, while also recommending that telcos and other companies subject to data retention obligations should challenge existing non-compliant data retention regimes.\nThe two recent CJEU judgements of note here are the Digital Rights Ireland case (2014), and the Tele-2/ Watson decision (2016). The former judgement rolled back an earlier EU directive aimed at harmonizing data retention regimes across the bloc by asking Member States to impose obligations on providers of comms services to retain certain types of data for a period of between six months and two years. While the latter expanded on the earlier jurisprudence.\nIn the Digital Rights Ireland decision the CJEU held the 2006 directive to be invalid as a disproportionate exercise of the EU legislature’s powers and in breach of citizen’s human rights.\nThe court was concerned about the lack of satisfactory limits to access, and by the fact data retention periods were not tailored to the goals or crimes concerned.\nIn the more recent Tele-2/Watson decision, at the end of last year, the court expanded on Digital Rights Ireland, with a judgment which positively asserted minimum safeguards of EU law that must be prescribed in any national data retention legislation — specifically precluding:\nHowever Privacy International’s survey of Member States data retention regimes indicates that many are yet to make the necessary changes to ensure domestic legislation is compliant with the court rulings.\nIt’s urging the European Commission to provide guidance on reviewing national data retention laws to help ensure states’ conformity with fundamental rights, as interpreted by Europe’s top court, the CJEU.\n“Member States have an obligation to ensure that their laws comply with the CJEU’s jurisprudence, and EU law more generally. It is thus concerning to notice that only a limited proportion of Member States have actually annulled their pre-Digital Rights legislation and that practically no Member States’ laws currently comply with Tele-2/Watson,” it writes in the report.\n“Very few governments have taken the lead in pushing legal reforms, and to the extent that limited positive changes at the national level have occurred, they have been the result of litigation initiated by NGOs and other small interest groups.”\nPrivacy International found that close to half (40 per cent) of the countries surveyed for the report still had the invalidated 2006 directive in place. While, as a generally rule, it said it found that where repeals or amendments had taken place this was as a result of challenges in national courts predominantly by human rights NGOs — with governments and legislators “largely inactive”.\nAnd even in Member States where the prior data retention regime has been invalidated in the national courts, and where new data retention legislation has come into force after Digital Rights Ireland, it found national laws to be “nonetheless inconsistent” with the CJEU’s most recent ruling in Tele-2/Watson — saying this was true for around a fifth of the countries surveyed.\n“In those countries the regimes might allow indiscriminate retention of data in bulk or provide vague and ill-defined regulation on access to that data by relevant authorities,” it warns.\n“Data retention legislation is being considered or is on hold in about 30% of the jurisdictions surveyed, and in about half of these cases attempts to ensure compliance with Tele-2/Watson are being pushed. Nonetheless, we are now eight months into the CJEU decision, and the slow pace by which changes are evolving in these jurisdictions is concerning, given how impactful these data retention regimes are on Europeans’ fundamental rights and freedoms,” it adds.\nPrivacy International’s report was compiled after consulting with digital rights NGOs and industry in 21 national jurisdictions across the EU — specifically in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nIn the UK’s case, the government passed expanded state surveillance legislation at the end of last year — aka the Investigatory Powers Act (or, to give it its colloquial name, the ‘Snoopers’ charter‘) — which includes a provision requiring that ISPs retain web activity data for all their users for a period of 12 months.\nAsked what it has been able to glean regarding the UK government’s intention to respond to the Tele-2/Watson ruling, a Privacy International spokeswoman noted that the case has been remitted back to the court of appeal — saying there’s therefore still no clarity on how the legislation might be amended.\n“The government stated recently that “…in light of the CJEU judgement, and in order to bring an end to the litigation, the government have accepted to the Court of Appeal that the Act was inconsistent with EU law in two areas.” However, until a hearing takes place, the details of what the government is prepared to accept, the response to this from the Claimants’ and ultimately what results from the CJEU’s ruling is unknown,” she told us.\nThe spokeswoman also said it’s unclear whether the data retention obligations the law places on ISPs have been activated yet, or whether they’re on pause as a result of the ongoing legal uncertainty. “It is unclear whether this is current in force,” she said, adding: “Not all of the Investigatory Powers Act has come into force.”\nThere’s a further uncertainty in the UK’s case relating to the Brexit referendum decision for the country to leave the European Union.\nSince that vote last year, the government has said it wants to extract the UK from the jurisdiction of the CJEU — raising questions of whether it might seek to avoid compliance with the EU-level data retention rules once it’s no longer a Member State.\nHowever the Privacy International spokeswoman suggested any such move by the UK to ignore Europe-wide principles on data retention could complicate the government’s stated aim for “a quick and seamless data flow with the EU following Brexit” — an essential component if UK digital businesses are to continue to serve customers in the EU after the two-year Brexit negotiation process comes to an end in May 2019.\n“Failing to comply with this judgement will raise questions as to whether the UK law provides equivalent protection to personal data as the EU standards,” she suggested. “Further, the government’s recent position paper on Brexit raises more questions than it answers in relation to the CJEU and the bearing its rulings will have on the UK.”", "tags": "national-security,law,data-retention,mass-surveillance", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/eu-states-data-retention-laws-still-violating-privacy-rights-report-warns/", "id": "1536723"}, {"title": "Virtual science lab startup Labster bags $10M to accelerate its ed tech play", "text": "Ed tech startup Labster whose software platform enables virtual simulations of laboratories for teaching life science to students, has closed a $10 million Series A round of funding led by early stage European VC firm Balderton Capital. Stockholm-based Northzone is also joining the round, as is Unity Technologies founder David Helgason — clearly spying strategic potential in a platform that makes use of 3D gaming environments for an educational purpose.\nLabster launched its lab simulation software back in 2013, after founding the business in 2011 and initially working on the concept in stealth. It has created around 65 simulations thus far, covering life science study topics — from a basic introduction to acids and bases where students perform a simulation of handling corrosive chemicals and get to see the consequences of not following good lab safety protocol, to a simulation of using a confocal microscope (a piece of lab kit that can run to multiple thousands of dollars in its physical form).\nAll the 3D simulations include games and challenges designed to keep students engaged and learning — such as murder mystery puzzles and multiple choice quiz questions, with text theory also available for students’ reference. The 3D environments are designed much like point and click adventure games, meaning lab equipment can be interacted with and environments navigated by clicking around.\n\nThe startup’s grand vision is to replace the role of textbooks for science education up to graduate level with a more interactive learning experience enabled by virtual simulations of lab equipment and experiments — so a scalable and accessible gamification of the learning experience, which does not require an institution to shell out on expensive, real-world lab equipment in order for its students to learn.\nStill, CEO and co-founder Mads Bonde concedes universities aren’t the faster adopters of new technologies, so he describes the learning “status quo” — i.e. textbooks and lectures — as Labster’s main competitor at this point.\n“We know the way that the education space is moving it’s not going to happen overnight, but even the university sector publishers know that that’s the way that things are going — that the next version of what is now called the text book will be much more interactive,” he tells TechCrunch. “In the medium term it definitely needs to co-exist with a lot of other methods — including books, including videos, including other areas.”\nWhen we last spoke to Labster, in 2013 for the launch of its product, it had raised $1M in grants and non-equity support at that point. Bonde tells us now it has since topped up that to a further ~$10M — which is in addition to the now closed $10M Series A VC investment.\n“We’ve been in dialogue with a lot of investors over the years but have chosen to focus on a combination of things, so bootstrapping but especially sales early on combined with grants from especially the government here in Europe and in Denmark,” he says. “That has funded our collaborations with universities… which is kind of like the hidden way that we’ve gotten to where we are today.”\nHe says the reason Labster is taking VC funding now is as a result of being approached by an undisclosed strategic investor who was keen to collaborate — which pushed it to take a closer look at the options of either continuing to grow organically vs taking VC cash and putting their foot on the gas to accelerate product development and expansion in multiple markets.\n“We ended up concluding that VC funding was the right thing for us to do at this stage because we had scaled our product and now really need to fuel sales, marketing and getting our product across globally — so that fueled the decision there,” says Bonde, confirming this particular strategic investor was not Unity’s Helgason.\nLabster’s general calculus is that, ultimately, it will cost the same to develop 3D educational content via its platform as it costs to create content for a textbook. Although Bonde concedes there’s still “a huge imbalance” in the cost. But one way it’s trying to shrink that differential more quickly is via a content builder system it’s created atop its simulation platform — enabling users to build out its content proposition.\nSome of Labster’s Series A funding will be going towards this “lab builder” system — which lets educators and individuals create bespoke simulator content for other students to learn.\nThe majority of content currently available on the platform has been developed by Labster working with educational institute customers — including some high profile institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US and Imperial College in London — but that presents an obvious speed bump to scaling the business so you can see why they’re looking for ways to widen the content creation pipe.\n“We have students who have done this as well,” notes Bonde of lab builder created content. “That’s also our long term vision to revolutionize the way that science is taught by anyone being able to create high class 3D simulations like games and deploy them through our platform.”\n“If you hit a core part of the curriculum, each simulation should last for a very long time,” adds Balderton’s Sam Myer, who heads up the Nordics region for the investment firm, on the content pricing point — noting also that Labster’s simulations can be reused “over and over”.\n“The cost actually isn’t that different,” he argues.\n\nMyer says Labster’s proposition stood out for the VC firm on account of it being “at the center of the education market as a whole going digital”, and for the way it’s “rethinking what you can do when you have digital platforms to build on”. — i.e. rather than trying to bring existing formats online; be that textbooks (to ebooks) or lectures (online streams) or indeed whole courses (MOOCs).\n“Labster is really rethinking what educational content should look like when you can design it from the ground up using these new tools,” he tells TechCrunch. “So it’s a very different approach to ed tech that many other companies have.”\nCurrently Labster has around 150 institutions globally using its platform, with the UK and the US as its primary markets. (Bonde also flags users in Asian markets, including in Hong Kong, Singapore, and in South America.)\nIt has a blended business model, where it sells b2b to universities and educational institutions as well as b2c to students who might want to make individual use of its tools to aid their learning — and it’s intended to invest to expand on both fronts with the new funding.\nExpanding simulation content across more science topics is also on the roadmap for the next 12 months. Plus, it will be expanding sales and marketing efforts, especially targeting universities in the US and the UK, with Bonde noting “heavy investment” there” — including growing the headcount of the team.\n“Over the last five years we’ve really focused on developing this platform which can handle educational simulations but with the game engine built on top of Unity so it’s possible to design learning experiences where you can learn the way that we believe humans are supposed to learn,” he argues. “The way that children learn as well — which is through interacting, through talking with different people, through experiencing the way the world is. And the you internalize that and learn from that.”\nAnd while guided simulations might at least suggest the potential for an even wider disruption of traditional teaching institutions, say by removing the need for such institutions to exist at all, Bonde says there’s still a key role for universities to play — in hosting content and ensuring quality is up to a benchmarked educational standard.\nMyer agrees. “I think universities are always going to be important in terms of guiding what should be taught, and how these simulations should be designed — and so it’s always going to be important to partner with some of the universities that [Labster is] already doing work with,” he says. “The leaders in this space… And then each university’s main differentiation, their main brand is what they teach — and how good their education is, and their sort of stamp of approval. So each university will want to have a say in what gets taught. So I think they’ll always be important.”\nAnother component of Labster’s vision is VR and AR. Virtual reality and augmented reality are areas of special interest for the startup, although — pragmatically and some might say realistically — it’s not built its platform to be reliant on these technologies. Rather it’s taking a cross-platform approach, meaning users of laptops and tablets can make use of the platform so there’s no requirement for any dedicated headset hardware. This allows it to address the current reality of the kit students and universities own, even as it contemplates transformational VR-enabled learning environments becoming a mass market future reality.\n\nBonde is certainly convinced that immersive VR simulations will play a leading role in the future of education, noting for example that the technology is developing to support feedback via additional peripherals such as tactile gloves. He also believes augmented reality will play a key bridging role — helping students who have cut their undergraduate teeth learning in entirely virtual 3D labs to transition to using real-world lab equipment for post-grad learning (where purely 3D simulations would not suffice).\nBut his conviction is tempered with patience that such changes will only come over the longer term. “We believe that in the long term virtual reality and AR as well will be one of the  main ways to learn. But it’s not going to happen overnight,” he suggests. “So what we’ve done is to create a platform where it’s possible to use it on a computer and on VR with the same code-base and the same simulation basically. So the students can choose which device. And they can even switch between devices — both VR and non-VR.”\n“Right now VR is not crucial for our proposition,” he adds. “With laptops etc we get the big leap forward… The way that you interact in a game-like environment — that’s really where you get the major benefit.”\nBalderton’s Myer is also cool on VR in the near to medium term. “VR, down the line, I think will be the best way to display what they can do,” he says of Labster’s lab simulations. “Labster’s really about learning by doing. And they have these very strong 3D simulations. Right now the [VR] hardware — the actual devices — aren’t available to most universities or companies or schools that want to be using it. And so it’s important to be able to do these 3D simulations on your mobile phone, or on your laptop or whatever you might be using.\n“But they’re building it to have this very rich 3D environment that can be translated to VR. So I think VR is going to change the way that education happens in a pretty big way… There’s a lot of research around simulations and how they really improve learning outcomes. And then VR is a really good format for these simulations.”\nAsked how bullish he is about VR generally, Myer suggests the tech still has a long road ahead of it to achieve mainstream adoption — though he sees nearer term applications for education use-cases vs gaming. “I think it’s going to take a while before we see the mass market. Especially when we talk about things like casual gaming — it’s going to take a while,” he argues.\n“I’ve spent quite a lot of time looking at gaming as well, where VR is seen as one of the platform they’re trying to build for. And actually the use-case for education at the moment is much stronger than gaming. If you think of what you do when you’re trying to learn in general is you pick up a textbook or whatever and you try to submerge yourself into this body of content for a long period of time. And so VR, given that it’s a very submersive experience, is actually very challenging to do for gaming where you’re sort of dipping in and out… It’s actually very difficult to build a game that works well for VR at this stage.”\nIn developing its learning platform, Bonde says Labster has worked with psychologists to try identify educational advantages that can be enabled by technology, such as tracking users’ emotions and blood pressure and analyzing brain scans during use of the platform — and based on what it’s seen from this research he claims VR advances the learning experience because users are “totally immersed”.\nBut he simultaneously emphasizes Labster’s tech agnosticism, adding: “It’s important for us not to be reliant on virtual reality propagation for our success.”", "tags": "unity,simulation,balderton-capital,labster", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/virtual-science-lab-startup-labster-bags-10m/", "id": "1535711"}, {"title": "BandLab​ ​Technologies​ acquires Chew.tv, a video streaming service for DJs", "text": "Chew.tv, a video streaming service for DJs to show off their mixing skills, has been acquired by BandLab Technologies, the Singapore-based ‘social’ music-making platform.

The premise being that dance music DJs are both content consumers and creators, and that Chew.tv could serve both needs, allowing DJs at different levels to learn from and be inspired by each other — not entirely dissimilar to online gamers.\nThat appeared to find some traction, seeing Chew garner an undoubtedly loyal and passionate user base. In July, it disclosed that the service had a community of 380,000+ users, who, since launch, have collectively created over 120,000 hours of content.\nWith that said, Chew.tv narrowly avoided the deadpool earlier this year after its streaming infrastructure was “heavily misused” by a nefarious hacker the previous December. “The abuse cost is more than we can afford, and the combined total of that and our regular running costs is enough to put us out of business,” the company emailed users in March.\nHowever, in a nice turn of events, Chew’s community rallied together under the #savedchew hashtag, and via £12,000 in donations and an increase in premium subscriptions, the service was saved and the startup, which was down to a single staff member in co-founder Will Benton, lived to fight another day. Which brings us to today’s acquisition.\nI’m told that BandLab has acquired all technology & IP of the Chew platform. “We’re not disclosing dollar amounts for the deal. This was a privately funded deal – we worked to find a fair price that both parties were happy with,” says a BandLab spokesperson.\nMeanwhile, BandLab​ ​Technologies says Chew.tv will be rebranded as “Chew by BandLab”. In addition, the startup’s live streaming technology will be integrated into BandLab’s web platform, Android and iOS apps “for use by BandLab’s existing user base of close to 2 million users”.\n“I am very pleased that Chew will now be supported by the BandLab team. For the past two years I’ve been closely watching the growth and development of this great platform and community of DJs,” said Meng Ru Kuok, BandLab CEO and co-founder, in a statement. “One of the most important parts of being a musician today is performing live, and as an extension of that, it’s extremely important for us to be able to digitally support creators and musicians who want to bring their live performances to the world”.", "tags": "bandlab-technologies,chew", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/bandlab%e2%80%8b-%e2%80%8btechnologies%e2%80%8b-acquires-chew-tv/", "id": "1535994"}, {"title": "UK’s FiveAI gets $35M to build a taxi service powered by its own self-driving car platform", "text": "The race is on for autonomous vehicle technology, and now a startup out of the U.K. is the latest to throw its hat into the ring to help build it. Cambridge-based FiveAI — a partner in the U.K.’s StreetWise self-driving project — has raised £14 million ($18 million) and £12.8 million ($17 million) in two tranches to fill out its plans for a two-part business in the world of self-driving services. First, FiveAI is building its own autonomous driving system; and second, FiveAI will use that AI-based platform to take on Uber and other transportation services with a fleet of self-driving taxis.\nLakestar Capital — the firm founded by prolific (and successful) investor Klaus Hommels — led this Series A round, with Amadeus Capital Partners, Notion Capital and Kindred (which all previously invested in its seed round of $2.7 million) also participating.\nOn top of the Series A, FiveAI will also get a boost in the form of a grant from the U.K. government: it has so far received £12.8 million ($17 million) for StreetWise, a project it’s working on with Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, Oxford University, insurer Direct Line and others to develop a self-driving car pilot for London to cut traffic congestion and free up parking spaces. StreetWise is slated for its first test runs at the end of 2019.\nThere are many, many companies today working on autonomous car systems. They include other startups like Zoox and Nutonomy (which, like FiveAI, are building platforms that they plan to use in their own fleets), transportation providers like Uber, car makers (which themselves are acquiring startup talent to kickstart their efforts), those like Bosch that build in-car systems already and, of course, tech giants like Google, Apple and Baidu that approach cars like the next big hardware challenge.\nWith the billions in funding and armies of engineers that these companies have to commit to these efforts, FiveAI’s Series A and government grant appear very modest indeed.\nBut Stan Boland — FiveAI’s CEO and co-founder — is not one to be deterred. In an interview earlier today in FiveAI’s (still sparse) new offices, he made a case for why Europe needs its own startup in this area. For one, our driving culture is completely different and our cities don’t look like cities in the U.S. or Asia. And further, he argues that it’s high time that we see more moonshots coming from here, building on the region’s strength in artificial intelligence.\n“We think it’s time that Europe builds a big tech company,” he said, noting that transport could well be at the heart of that big tech company. “Transport is a sector that is ready for change.”\nIt so happens that Boland is probably one founder investors will listen to when he explains a big plan. He has been at the head of some of Europe’s biggest startup exits in the last several years: they include Element 14, a spin-out from ARM that was acquired by Broadcom for $640 million; Icera, acquired by Nvidia for $367 million; and IoT startup Neul, acquired by Huawei, before moving on to FiveAI with other co-founders Ben Peters, Steve Allpress, John Redford and Simon Walker.\n“If anything, the bolder you are with investors, the more they seem to want to give you,” he said. (This may be a consequence of the aforementioned track record. I’m fairly certain that if, say, I walked into Klaus Hommels’ office and described my vision for an autonomous car startup, I might get quietly escorted out of the room.)\n“FiveAI is a fantastic example where the U.K. has the talent, ambition and market to build a truly successful technology-led company. Dense European cities present totally different technical, behavioral, regulatory and infrastructure challenges to their U.S. and Chinese counterparts for safe urban driverless technologies,” said Lakestar Capital’s Dharmash Mistry, who is joining FiveAI’s board with this round. “By assembling its talented team in the U.K. and seeking to support London’s transport objectives in partnership with the city itself, FiveAI can play a vital role in reducing congestion, emissions, costs, accidents and journey times, boosting the city economy at the same time.”\nTo be clear, he also added that FiveAI has raised exactly as much as it wanted to, for now, and he also said that he has also put some of his own money into the operation, as well.\nTo date, FiveAI has yet to launch any products, and if you have been following the autonomous car space you know there are many pieces that will need to come together before FiveAI, or any other company, can hope for large deployments.\nBoland describes FiveAI today as in “Phase One” of its business plan: it is building an autonomous platform to run vehicles, which will include demonstrating the platform’s cognitive abilities and running pilots. Phase Two will include the development of a dispatch system, the user experience development and the first commercial launch. It will also involve much more work to improve the regulatory environment “to make it feasible.” He believes this will come in 2021.\nPhase Three will be FiveAI’s big push to scale in the market. “It’s at that point that we will need to buy lots of cars,” where FiveAI’s autonomous system will be loaded, he said. “It’s probably at that point that we’ll need to raise a significant amount of money, in the hundreds of millions or billions.”\nAs for a Plan B, there is no Plan B that Boland will consider today.\n“We do recognize that startups do pivot, but we are not running multiple contingency plans right now,” he said. \n“It may sound completely mad to some,” he said, “but the reason why we think it’s needed and will work is because personal mobility is not going to be a winner takes all market. There is no single solution that will work everywhere.

It’s signed up 3,000 private hire taxi drivers by simply acquiring a taxi company which already holds a licence, City Drive Services. Paris is also mooted as its next city.\nTo promote the launch, Londoners are being offered a 50% discount on fares until the end of September, alongside suspended surge pricing. That may spark a price war with Uber, but Uber is much bigger and better known, having 40,000 drivers and 3 million London users. Taxify also only in 25 cities globally compared to Uber’s 600.\nWhat Taxify does have is a lower cost business model, allowing passengers to pay cheaper fares and also letting drivers retain more of the profits. Taxify takes a 15 per cent commission on rides compared to the 20-25 percent Uber charges drivers. It also accepts cash as well electronic payments from riders, unlike Uber. Taxify allows drivers to create a defined radius for pick ups, meaning they don’t need to stray too far from home, which may well appeal to some drivers.\nThe startup has built what it calls an “all-in-one solution for taxi companies”. Basically it’s a booking system with a consumer-facing app.\nTraditional taxi companies use Taxify’s web-based dispatcher and fleet management systems to manage their back-end and unite under Taxify’s consumer facing app to stay competitive against expanding networks like Hailo and Uber. That then lowers Taxify’s costs, allowing them to charge less.\nTaxify’s platform replaces the expensive platforms offered by older firms, allowing taxi firms to automate their workflows and start getting orders via the Taxify app at a fraction of the cost of custom solutions. It then charges the cab firm a low monthly fee of about 12-15€ per driver per month.\nTaxify’s other focus is its rapidly growing Local Partner programme, which allows entrepreneurs to set up their local Taxify business using a franchise model and become a city manager on a revenue share model.\nThe startup claims to have over 2.5 million customers, and recently announced a strategic partnership with Didi Chuxing in China.\nMarkus Villig, founder and CEO of Taxify, said: “London is a huge and thriving marketplace for private urban transport, and we’re excited to launch here.”\nTaxify originally emerged in 2014 with a seed round which was funded by investors from the so-called “Skype Mafia” in Estonia.\nThe launch comes as Uber struggles with legal setbacks, workplace harassment scandals, driver protests, the firing of co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick and bitter disputes amongst its board.

Transcripts of the communications were subsequently presented to him by his employer as evidence for terminating his employment for breach of the company’s internal regulations.\nThe grand chamber has ruled that Bărbulescu’s employer violated his right to respect for one’s “private and family life, his home and his correspondence” — aka Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.\nEarlier Romanian courts had rejected his complaint that his employer had violated his right to correspondence — including in January 2016, when a chamber judgement of the ECHR had held by six votes to one that there had been no violation of Article 8. However the grand chamber has held, by 11 votes to six, that Bărbulescu’s right to a private life was violated.\nIn a press release about the decision, the court noted that while it was questionable whether the complainant could have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in view of his employer’s restrictive regulations on Internet use (of which he had been informed), it judged that an employer’s instructions “could not reduce private social life in the workplace to zero”.\n“The right to respect for private life and for the privacy of correspondence continued to exist, even if these might be restricted in so far as necessary,” it writes.\nThe crux of the decision rests on Bărbulescu’s employer having failed to adequately inform him in advance that it might be monitoring his communications. The intrusiveness of the monitoring — with email contents being read — was also weighed by the judges in making this ruling.\n“The Court considered, following international and European standards, that to qualify as prior notice, the warning from an employer had to be given before the monitoring was initiated, especially where it entailed accessing the contents of employees’ communications,” it writes. “The Court concluded, from the material in the case file, that Mr Bărbulescu had not been informed in advance of the extent and nature of his employer’s monitoring, or the possibility that the employer might have access to the actual contents of his messages.”\nThe grand chamber also ruled that national courts had failed to sufficiently assess the scope and degree of the privacy intrusion (which involved monitoring all the contents of Bărbulescu’s communications); whether less intrusive methods could have been used; whether there had been legitimate reasons to justify the monitoring; and judged that national courts had not considered the seriousness of the consequences of the monitoring — i.e. Bărbulescu’s subsequent dismissal.\nIn the judgement, the grand chamber specifies several criteria to be used by national authorities when assessing whether monitoring of workplace communications is proportionate and employees are protected against arbitrariness, including —", "tags": "privacy,law", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/european-court-rules-employees-must-be-warned-if-comms-are-monitored/", "id": "1535966"}, {"title": "Index Ventures is coming in force to TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin this December", "text": "We are delighted to announce our next wave of speakers for Disrupt Berlin.

These are cited as things like trips or falls, alterations in eating habits, and changes in sleep behaviour.\n“Aifloo is a completely new e-health system that continually learns about an individual’s behavior – detecting if something is wrong,” explains Etzler. “We help seniors to keep going strong, give peace of mind to family and friends and augment the care delivered by professional caregivers”.\nThe idea, says the Aifloo founder, is to “digitalize detection of human behaviour in a non-intrusive way”. Specifically, the Aifloo wristband is conceived as a discreet wearable with a long battery life, whilst the real-time cloud AI-analysis does the heavy lifting.\n“The service measures trends over time, detects emergencies and alerts people of a problem even if you’re unable to,” he says. “We hope to help carers deliver the right care, at the right time, to those who need it the most, with a little help from technology”.\nThat, argues Etzler, is very different to the status quo in which the systems used in care are outdated. “A lot of resource goes into manual surveillance,” he says, while more modern solutions are “expensive, not customisable to the individual, or complicated”.\n“On the other hand, wearables are targeting the young and healthy or focused on one medical condition, such as diabetes. We’ve created an individualized, durable, easy to use, long-lived solution to a complex problem and packaged it in a nice, wearer friendly product and service”.\nTo that end, an early customer of Aifloo is Aleris, one of the leading healthcare companies in Scandinavia.

Two models are on tap and TechCrunch has learned from trusted sources the more expensive, fancier version will ship at a later time.\nIt’s unclear how long will separate the availability of the two different versions. Several reports have surfaced over the last few weeks pointing to supply issues and production glitches that could be the reason for the delay.\nToday The Wall Street Journal stated that a glitch in the manufacturing process pushed back the iPhone’s production by a month. Reportedly the issue stems from the decision to use OLED screens while also trying to integrate a fingerprint scanner into the screen itself. This process was apparently abandoned and the new iPhone will ship without a fingerprint scanner.\nApple apparently requires the screens to be made in a different fashion than what Samsung uses for its phones. For the iPhone, Apple separates the display and touch panel instead of integrating them together. This requires more steps to make each unit.\nThe new screens add another layer of complication outside of the manufacturing process. They’re apparently very expensive. As Romain pointed out earlier today, KGI Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple is paying $45 to $55 for LCD displays in current iPhone models. But Samsung is asking for $120 and $130 per unit.

This would be the version that would be released after the standard model.\nNew iPhones are always in short supply when they are first available and that’s likely to remain true with this version.

The project will be conducted at Mcity’s TechLab, a partnership between the University of Michigan’s Center for Entrepreneurship and Mcity around mobility.\nThe project’s press release points to an US DOT study that found a combined 46,000 cyclists suffered from vehicle accidents and fatalities in 2015.\n“Bicycle-to-vehicle collisions is a problem that affects all cyclists; a community we’re all passionate about,” said Jake Sigal, founder and CEO for Tome Software. “When Scott’s team at Trek approached me about helping to get automakers interested in working with the cycling community, I felt a personal responsibility to take part in leading this project.

For the first time, the company is likely going to switch from LCD displays to OLED displays, a newer technology that is causing some challenges. In particular, according to a new report from KGI Securities and obtained by Apple Insider, Samsung is going to be the sole supplier. Samsung is taking advantage of that by charging a ton of money for those displays.\nKGI Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple is paying $45 to $55 for LCD displays in current iPhone models. But Samsung is asking for $120 and $130 per unit. This could be the reason why the next high-end iPhone is going to be so expensive.\nThere are a few reasons why Apple has no choice but to pay a small fortune. First, Apple needs OLED displays more than ever before. Rumor has it that the next iPhone is going to feature a taller screen that is going to nearly fill the front of the device. Think of it as an iPhone 7-shaped device, but with a screen that expands toward the top and bottom edge of the device.\nIt’s like having an iPhone 7 Plus display in an iPhone 7 body. But the issue is that Apple will have to deal with a small-ish battery for quite a big display. Among other things, OLED displays are more energy-efficient. That’s why Apple can compensate the bigger display with OLED technology.\nWhile many Android manufacturers have used OLED displays for years, Apple faces some interesting scaling issues. The company is currently selling over 200 million iPhones every year.\nShipping hundreds of millions of devices creates some incredible supply chain issues. Apple can’t adopt the latest and newest components if it can’t get hundreds of millions components every year. A single component shortage could create a bottleneck for the entire production. Designing the iPhone is already quite impressive, but being able to ship so many iPhones is even more impressive.\nRight now, the only OLED supplier that can help Apple is Samsung. LG also manufactures OLED displays, but Bloomberg just reported that Apple will have to wait until 2019 to get LG displays. LG’s current OLED displays are also nowhere near as good as Samsung’s displays — just look at this Ars Technica comparison.\nThat’s how you end up with a classic case of asynchronous competition. Samsung and Apple are competing like crazy to sell more smartphones around the world. But Samsung is also an important supplier.

A new device developed at Harvard Medical School may soon let you test food for common allergens instead of using yourself as your own guinea pig.\nIt’s called the integrated exogenous antigen testing system, or iEAT — I’m sure that’s just a coincidence. The researchers describe it in a paper published in the journal ACS Nano.\nFirst you put a bit of food on the “antigen extraction device,” a single-use slide that does the necessary chemical deconstruction. You plug that into the iEAT device itself, which is small and light enough to fit on a keychain, and contains the electronics necessary to analyze the prepared food sample.\nWithin 10 minutes, it should tell you whether any given allergens are present, and if so, how much. That isn’t exactly lightning quick, but the alternatives are slower, bulkier or more dangerous (i.e. just eating it). And the iEAT actually detects even smaller amounts than lab tests. It’s not the only tester out there: There’s also the Nima, but that only does gluten and it’s a lot more expensive, and Ally, which did lactose in its prototype phase.\nRight now the device is set up to detect peanuts, hazelnuts, wheat, milk and eggs, but it could easily be configured to find other things: shellfish, pesticides and so on. The researchers tested it on a few restaurant items themselves and found gluten in a “gluten-free” salad, and egg protein in beer (gross).\nThe whole thing supposedly costs $40, though of course the antigen extraction devices are where they get you — hopefully you’ll be able to buy in bulk.

By using high frequencies inaudible to humans but which register on electronic microphones, they were able to issue commands to every major “intelligent assistant” that were silent to every listener but the target device.\nThe team from Zhejiang University calls their technique DolphinAttack (PDF), after the animals’ high-pitched communications. In order to understand how it works, let’s just have a quick physics lesson.\nMicrophones like those in most electronics use a tiny, thin membrane that vibrates in response to air pressure changes caused by sound waves. Since people generally can’t hear anything above 20 kilohertz, the microphone software generally discards any signal above that frequency, although technically it is still being detected — it’s called a low-pass filter.\nA perfect microphone would vibrate at a known frequency at, and only at, certain input frequencies. But in the real world, the membrane is subject to harmonics — for example, a tone at 400 Hz will also elicit a response at 200 Hz and 800 Hz (I’m fudging the math here but this is the general idea. There are some great gifs illustrating this at Wikipedia). This usually isn’t an issue, however, since harmonics are much weaker than the original vibration.\nBut say you wanted a microphone to register a tone at 100 Hz but for some reason didn’t want to emit that tone. If you generated a tone at 800 Hz that was powerful enough, it would create that 100 Hz tone with its harmonics, only on the microphone. Everyone else would just hear the original 800 Hz tone and would have no idea that the device had registered anything else.\nThat’s basically what the researchers did, although in a much more exact fashion, of course. They determined that yes, in fact, most microphones used in voice-activated devices, from phones to smart watches to home hubs, are subject to this harmonic effect.\nFirst they tested it by creating a target tone with a much higher ultrasonic frequency. That worked, so they tried recreating snippets of voice with layered tones between 500 and 1,000 Hz — a more complicated process, but not fundamentally different. And there’s not a lot of specialized hardware needed — off the shell stuff at Fry’s or its Chinese equivalent.\nThe demodulated speech registered just fine, and worked on every major voice recognition platform:\nThey were able to execute a number of commands, from wake phrases (“OK Google”) to multi-word requests (“unlock the back door”). Different phones and phrases had different success rates, naturally, or worked better at different distances. None worked farther than 5 feet away, though.\nIt’s a scary thought — that invisible commands could be humming through the air and causing your device to execute them (of course, one could say the same of Wi-Fi). But the danger is limited for several reasons.\nFirst, you can defeat DolphinAttack simply by turning off wake phrases. That way you’d have to have already opened the voice recognition interface for the attack to work.\nSecond, even if you keep the wake phrase on, many devices restrict functions like accessing contacts, apps and websites until you have unlocked them. An attacker could ask about the weather or find nearby Thai places, but it couldn’t send you to a malicious website.\nThird, and perhaps most obviously, in its current state the attack has to take place within a couple of feet and against a phone in the open. Even if they could get close enough to issue a command, chances are you’d notice right away if your phone woke up and said, “OK, wiring money to Moscow.”\nThat said, there are still places where this could be effective. A compromised IoT device with a speaker that can generate ultrasound might be able to speak to a nearby Echo and tell it to unlock a door or turn off an alarm.\nThis threat may not be particularly realistic, but it illustrates the many avenues by which attackers can attempt to compromise our devices.

The Turtle Rover is a new robot built by a small team that has worked on a number of Mars rover prototype projects for the European, German and Swedish space agencies.\nThe five-person team is seeking €60,000 (roughly $71,500 U.S.) to get their rover ON the ground (that’s a great joke), and will look to ship the vehicle beginning in April of next year, with DIY kits and fully built machines available to backers starting at around the $1,000 mark.\n\nTurtle is a four-wheel ground drone that can drive for up to four hours on a single charge of its included battery, with control facilitated via an app that’s compatible with most computers, tablets and smartphones. The Turtle can create its own Wi-Fi network for connections when you’re off the grid, which is great, because this thing is designed for exploring off the beaten path.\nIt’s based on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer, running Raspbian, and it comes equipped with a full HD camera for video capture and live streaming. The design is watertight, which means, according to the project’s creators, that it can be fully submerged in water with no ill effects. There’s also a robot arm provided with the roader, which can lift up to 1.1 pounds. And it’s fully customizable, so you can incorporate your own add-ons, like the Microsoft Kinect or a LiDAR sensor for depth and environment sensing.\nIt can carry up to 11 pounds on its back, in fact, so you could easily load up a DSLR and lens, or a box to load down with your cache of interesting geological samples if you’re doing some remote spelunking. All of the hardware and software is also fully open source, and the project’s creators encourage its use as a development or educational platform.\nThe Turtle Rover is designed to reach hard-to-access places more easily than you could, and to do so without intruding as much as a lumbering human. You can see in the video how it might be able to explore where you can’t. The team says it also has a very low center of gravity, and a suspension inspired by actual NASA Mars rovers, which should help it navigate even tricky terrain with aplomb — and without rolling over.\nTurtle Rover was created by its five-person team, which includes Simon Dzwonczyk, Julia Marek, Martin Twardak, Aleksander Dziopa and Justyna Pelc, with no external funding, and is relying 100 percent on backers at this point. Despite that, the five left their corporate jobs and managed to build a fully functional prototype in six months, and they say that now venture capitalists are calling since they’ve demonstrated their ability to make Turtle a real thing.\nFor a bootstrapped hardware startup project it looks very promising, and like something that would appeal to any amateur space or drone hobbyists looking to dig deeper into their interest, or help educate others with a true maker project.

The first product the company produced was called ScienceOps, which was the tool that would become Promote.\nAlteryx, which went public earlier this year, is looking to become the soup-to-nuts analytics platform for data scientists and business analysts, and having a tool that allowed the different parties to share data was a missing piece before the Yhat purchase.\nThe Promote product was announced today, but won’t be generally available until Q1 next year.

Rackspace expects the acquisition, which is its largest one yet, to close in the next quarter.\nThe two privately held companies did not disclose the financial details of the transaction, but Datapipe has raised more than $310 million in equity funding since its launch in 1998 and this deal surely didn’t come cheap. Datapipe’s majority owner, Abry Partners, will become an equity investor in Rackspace and the combined company will have more than 6,700 employees and do more than $2.4 billion in annual revenue.\n“The reason we’re buying them is that we want to extend our leadership in multi-cloud services,” Rackspace chief strategy officer Matt Bradley told me. “It’s a sign and signal that we’re going for it.” Bradley expects that the combined company will make Rackspace the largest private cloud player and the largest managed hosting service. He also noted that the fact that Rackspace is now a private company again, with a single owner, allowed it to go for this deal. “This would have been very hard to get done under our old structure,” he noted.\nWhile Datapipe has been extremely successful in the enterprise and with government customers, Rackspace has traditionally focused more on the mid-market segment. Indeed, Bradley argues that the two companies didn’t typically compete on every deal and he stressed that even their product portfolios are quite different, too. He added that while Rackspace could have gained similar technical capabilities by making a number of smaller acquisitions, that process would have taken much longer and wouldn’t necessarily have given Rackspace access to the kind of customers that Datapipe currently works with, and Bradley argues that would’ve taken at least two years — if not longer.\n\nThose customers include a large number of large public-sector companies, but also the U.S. departments of defense, energy and justice, in addition to the U.K.’s cabinet office, ministry of justice and department of transportation.\nOnce the acquisition closes, Rackspace will also get new data centers and offices in markets where it currently doesn’t have much of a presence, including the West Coast (something its customers have long asked for), Brazil, China and Russia. In China, Datapipe also currently offers managed services on the fast-growing Alibaba Cloud and that’s surely a market Rackspace wants to play in, too. Rackspace will also get access to Datapipe’s colocation services — a market it hasn’t traditionally played in — and the company’s professional services businesses.\nBradley noted that Rackspace can also bring new capabilities to current Datapipe users, including its services for Azure Stack and VMware Cloud on AWS, as well as its managed services on the Google Cloud Platform.\nBecause the two companies still have to wait for regulatory approval, some of the details of what the combined company will look like remain unclear. The official word is that “Rackspace will develop a comprehensive integration plan and will take great care to maintain and\nenhance the exceptional customer outcomes that both companies are known for.” Rackspace also notes that its executive team will stay in place and might expand after the acquisition closes.", "tags": "enterprise,datapipe,rackspace", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/rackspace-acquires-datapipe-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-managed-cloud-business/", "id": "1538612"}, {"title": "A perfect storm of corporate idiocy", "text": "At this point in the game there should be a single page on every corporate website, preferably accessible from its front page, that includes the name and all contact details for the Chief Security Officer, including the last four digits of her social security number.

This honeypot should inspire the this CSO to go to great lengths to protect herself and her company’s data.\nIt’s only fair, right?\nThis person – who in Equifax’s case was named John Kelley III and earned nearly $3 million for releasing 143 million customer records (about 2 cents per record) – should also be the first to be fired during a breach. Further, this person should no longer work in “security” and instead be relegated where he can do less damage, perhaps in food service but not food preparation.\n\nI doubt they’d be trustworthy enough to fry a hamburger.\nI know it’s a little Hunger Games but I think that’s where we are in 2017. Corporate security is an afterthought.\nI propose this for a simple reason: no one else on Equifax’s corporate leadership board works on security. There are plenty of folks dedicate to sales and revenue growth but only Kelley has “has responsibility for legal services, global sourcing, security and compliance, government and legislative relations and more.” He’s a lawyer.\nBreaches are an affront to decades of innovation and research. Breaches are an affront to ethics, customer support, and trust. Breaches are an affront to shareholders and those who depended on Equifax for, arguably, a ridiculous service in these days of trust-less networks and powerful data mining tools.\nAdd in a clearly inept team at,  we assume, Edelman, and you have a perfect storm of corporate idiocy.

Now, thanks to what we can assume was some interference by Equifax’s legal department, nobody is affected, not even Booger.\n\nThat’s right: it went from “Yeah, you’re definitely probably hacked” to “No, you’re probably not hacked” overnight. This tool should be burnt down.\nIn short, Equifax can’t protect your data, can’t build a website, and can’t get its story straight. And this is a publicly-traded company with a century of tradition and trust behind it.\nWhy am I so angry at this? Imagine John Kelley III had a box of family photos. He sent those family photos to a service for digitization. Those photos included tender moments, pictures loved ones dead and gone, and snaps joyous occasions. There’s ap picture there of him passing the bar, of getting married, of saying goodbye to his father. This photo digitization service did the job – poorly, to be clear, because we’re equating it to Equifax – and then threw the box of photos with full identifying information onto the street. John Kelley’s grandmother’s photo was used to create a fake ID. John Kelley’s birthday party pic was posted to Facebook and someone figured out his birthdate or some other piece of trivial information and opened a credit card in his name. Trolls found a picture of his car, deduced its location, and cut the brake lines. The list of offenses can go on ad nauseam.\nNow imagine the same thing is happening to you. Almost monthly your family photos, your birth certificate, and your diary are being ransacked or nearly ransacked by criminals. Your valuables are being broadcast to those who would like to steal them. Imagine that the companies you trust with your health, wealth, and privacy are leaking your information almost daily and that the tools used to secure that data are infuriatingly easy to crack as possible. You’d be mad as hell and you wouldn’t take it anymore.\nBut you aren’t. And you do.\nUntil John Kelley III is held accountable, until everyone who leaks our data and uses weak tools and methods to secure our data is out of a job, we will not be safe.

The enterprise is more excited about machine learning and applied artificial intelligence than ever, and in order to meet this growing opportunity, we are heading in a new direction.”\nCollecting that kind of expertise is going to be critical as it looks to woo enterprises into paying for additional support and services on top of open-source software. Cloudera’s business can be a tricky one, much like Docker and MongoDB — which is built on top of open-source technology that anyone can use.

Today, they are announcing a major expansion of this partnership that sees them collaborating around e-signatures and team communications.\nSpecifically, this expanded deal means that Adobe Sign will become Microsoft’s preferred e-signature solution, with integrations into Office 365 and Dynamics 365, while Microsoft Teams — the company’s Slack competitor — will become the preferred collaboration service for the Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud.\nMicrosoft will also integrate Adobe Sign into services like its workflow automation service Flow, and the Microsoft bot framework will be able to talk to Sign, too, to check on the status of an approval process, for example. And when a user drops a new template into a specific Creative Cloud folder, Flow will also be able to see this and automatically route the document through the approval process.\nSimilarly, Adobe will also make Microsoft Azure its preferred cloud of Adobe sign. This means Adobe’s Creative Cloud tools, for example, will see deep integrations into Microsoft Teams.\n\nThe Adobe Sign integration with Teams, Flow, Word, PowerPoint and Outlook will go live in the coming weeks. The Creative Cloud integration with Microsoft teams will also launch soon, with the integrations into the Adobe Experience Cloud following after that.\nAdobe’s Jon Perera, the company’s VP of product development for its Document Cloud, told me that he expects this deal will also make other Adobe products, including the likes of the Adobe Stock stock imagery marketplace, more discoverable, and will hence drive more users to it.

They also have to deal with wide variety of content with text, gifs, images and video by the score. While part of the goal was to improve traditional search functionality and deliver more relevant results, perhaps even more critically, they wanted a tool to help users surface the subjects that interest them without having to explicitly state it in the search box, Nick Caldwell, VP of engineering at Reddit explained.\n“I think that people who come to any site, and Reddit in particular, prefer an experience where they don’t have to do manual keyword entry, but want a continuous stream of interesting content,” he said.\nReddit’s search engine had actually been notoriously bad and Caldwell made upgrading it a priority. “One of the things I wanted to do when I started at Reddit, was I wanted to fix [search]. People have been complaining about it for five years,” he said.\nPart of the issue up to that point wasn’t a lack of desire to improve the search experience. Everyone understood the issue, but finding the time to update it was another matter. When Caldwell came on board, Reddit had a small team of 40 engineers, whose primary job was keeping a site of this size and scope up and running.\nCaldwell said that the company went with the Lucidworks Fusion platform because it had the right combination of technology and the ability to augment his engineering team, while helping search to continually evolve on Reddit. Buying a tool was only part of the solution though. Reddit also needed to hire a group of engineers with what Caldwell called “world class search and relevance engineering expertise.” To that end, he has set up a 30-person engineering search team devoted to maximizing the potential of the new search platform.\nLucidworks is built on the open source search tool, Apache Solr, but company CEO Will Hayes says the commercial product has been built to scale to Reddit-like proportions. “Solr is the core engine. We still heavily contribute to the open source project, but we put a lot of focus on how people consume data,” Hayes explained.\nThe means working in a streaming fashion to span billions of records in near real time, while using analytics and machine learning to understand the underlying data and deliver more relevant results and content to Reddit users.\nToday’s search update is part of Reddit’s wider campaign to update the site’s look and feel, which became an organizational priority after the site’s two founders returned to the company — with Alexis Ohanian coming back in 2014 and Steve Huffman in 2015.\n“With Steve and Alexis coming back, they brought to table that the site should be more welcoming and engaging than it has been in the past. It took the leadership of Steve and Alexis to see that the content we have is really a gold mine, and we have to find a way to present it to users to unlock that potential,” he said.\nWhile Lucidworks remains an active partner in the project, Caldwell hopes his team will be able to take over by the end of the year.

Some of the IP will end up inside IBM products and services. MIT hopes to generate some AI-based startups as part of the deal too.\n“The core mission of joint lab is to bring together MIT scientists and IBM [researchers] to shape the future of AI and push the frontiers of science,” IBM’s Gil told TechCrunch.\nTo that end, the two parties plan to put out requests to IBM scientists and the MIT student community to submit ideas for joint research. To narrow the focus of what could be a broad endeavor, they have established a number of principles to guide the research.\nThis includes developing AI algorithms with goal of getting beyond specific applications for neural-based deep learning networks and finding more generalized ways to solve complex problems in the enterprise.\nSecondly, they hope to harness the power of machine learning with quantum computing, an area that IBM is working hard to develop right now.

Mesosphere, which was one of the early companies to adopt containers and which focuses on allowing businesses to run their big data and analytics workloads in the cloud, today announced that it now also supports Kubernetes on its DC/OS platform for running big data applications in the cloud. This announcement is going to come as quite a surprise to many, given that Mesosphere has long offered its own container orchestration tool for DC/OS and Apache Mesos in the form of Marathon.\nKubernetes will be available in beta as part of the DC/OS 1.10 release that’s scheduled to launch on September 11.\nThe Information, which broke this story earlier this morning, argues that this means that Mesosphere is “bowing” to Kubernetes. That’s something Mesosphere co-founder and CEO Florian Leibert and Mesosphere CMO Peter Guagenti strongly denied when I talked to them earlier today. They both stressed that the idea here is to give Mesosphere’s users — which tend to be large enterprises — more choice. “Our customers tend to be infrastructure and operations professionals at large companies who are serving hundreds or thousands of developers in an organization,” Guagenti said. “For them, the most important thing they provide is freedom of choice.”\nIn Leibert’s view, offering support for Kubernetes as an orchestration engine is no different from offering support for multiple data services, continuous integration platforms and networking tools. Guagenti also later stressed that it’s important to remember that for Mesosphere’s customers, the platform isn’t about containers — it’s about deploying and managing data-intensive applications.\nLeibert also noted that Marathon and Kubernetes have different use cases because Marathon can also be used to run legacy applications without container technology, while Kubernetes is obviously solely focused on containers. “So it’s natural for us to support both,” Leibert said. “A lot of these technologies are really like a layer cake. Kubernetes and Mesos can work really well together. Kubernetes takes over the container workflow but it can’t handle workflows that typically don’t run on containers like Hadoop.”\nGuagenti also noted that he believes that Mesosphere is currently a leader in the container space, both in terms of the number of containers its users run in production and in terms of revenue (though the company sadly didn’t share any numbers).\nLeibert and Guagenti both stressed that Mesosphere will continue to invest in Marathon, just like it always has.\nGoing forward, developers will be able to use DC/OS to set up and manage their Kubernetes-based container deployments (including different versions of Kubernetes) right from DC/OS and on the same infrastructure that runs the rest of their container deployments. Mesosphere worked with Google on this project and Mesosphere will offer its users a pure up-stream version of Kubernetes without any vendor-specific changes to ensure there are no compatibility issues.\n“In bringing Kubernetes to DC/OS, Mesosphere provides customers with a robust platform for building, deploying, and operating data-rich, containerized applications in your data center and on public clouds,” said Allan Naim, a Google product manager in charge of Kubernetes and the Google Container Engine. “With projects like Kubernetes for containers and TensorFlow for machine intelligence running on both our platforms, Mesosphere DC/OS and Google Cloud Platform together offer a compelling open hybrid cloud platform. We’re excited to continue to work with Mesosphere and the community going forward.”\nAt the end of the day, Mesosphere argues that it’s simply giving its customers more choice, though it’s also clear that this is yet another win for the Kubernetes ecosystem, which really isn’t so much of a threat to Mesosphere, which has long found its own niche, but more for Docker, which runs the risk of falling behind, even as it kickstarted the container movement. Indeed, I can’t help but think that this move by Mesosphere is actually going to make it harder for Docker to find its own niche going forward.", "tags": "enterprise,kubernetes,containers,mesosphere", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/mesosphere-says-its-not-bowing-to-kubernetes/", "id": "1536743"}, {"title": "Nginx goes beyond its server roots and launches its application platform", "text": "Nginx, in its commercial and open source forms, is one of the most popular load balancers, proxies, web and application servers on the internet today.

Unit is already available.\nThe existing Nginx Web Application Firewall rounds out the platform. Pricing for the full platform remains up in the air while Controller is still in closed beta.\nIt’s also worth noting that while Unit will be open source, Controller is a closed-source project.

ForgeRock, a seven year old identity startup says it has built an identity platform with those kinds of scale requirements in mind.\nThe approach appears to be resonating with investors.

Today’s investment brings the total to more than $140 million raised to-date.\nCEO Mike Ellis sees his company’s approach to identity as a natural extension of what’s happening the industry. “The relationships between humans, devices, things and services is driving security,” he says. He believes it’s also driving new applications for identity and new business opportunities.\nIt’s something the company has been building towards from the earliest days, a platform than can scale to deal with identity from a variety of sources beyond just human users. “We believe you have to exist everywhere — at the device and gateway level like a connected car, but also on prem and in cloud,” he said.\nEllis admits that his company has flown under the radar compared with better-known identity companies like Ping Identity, which was sold last year for $600 million to Vista Equity and Okta, which went public in May. But he says the timing of the big round is not a coincidence.\nHe firmly believes as tech makes the shift to machine-to-machine and sensor-to-machine communications in massive numbers, it’s going to require a new kind of identity platform to deal with the volume that will entail. He also not surprisingly sees his company well positioned to take advantage of that shift.\nHe’s so confident in fact, he says that today’s investment is the first step toward an IPO. That tends to be information that startup CEOs keep close to the vest, but he is not bashful about saying that is his goal.

The move was, at the time, derided by some as pointless, akin to shooing criminals away from one neighborhood only to trouble another. But a new study shows that, for Reddit at least, it has had lasting positive effects.\nThe policing of hate speech online has become a flash point for many a flame war, these past few months especially, as white nationalists, neo-nazis and others with abhorrent but strictly speaking quite legal viewpoints struggle with being banned repeatedly from the internet’s biggest platforms.\n\t\nResearchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology took this question seriously, as until someone actually investigates whether such bans are helpful, harmful or some mix thereof, it’s all speculation. So they took a major corpus of Reddit data (compiled by PushShift.io) and examined exactly what happened to the hate speech and purveyors thereof, with the two aforementioned subreddits as case studies.\nEssentially they looked at the thousands of users that made up CT and FPH (as they call them) and quantified their hate speech usage. They then compared this pre-ban data to the same users post-ban: how much hate speech they produced, where they “migrated” to (i.e. duplicate subreddits, related ones, etc.) and whether “invaded” subreddits experienced spikes in hate speech as a result. Control groups were created by observing the activity of similar subreddits that weren’t banned.\nWhat they found was encouraging for this strategy of reducing unwanted activity on a site like Reddit:\nAll in all, the researchers conclude, the ban was quite effective at what it set out to do:\nOf course, it’s not so simple as all that. Naturally, many of the users who previously spewed racial slurs at CT just moved over to Gab or Voat, where their behavior is proudly fostered. But the point of the bans at Reddit wasn’t to eliminate racism; it was to discourage it on the platform. To that end, it accomplished its goal (I’ve asked Reddit what it thinks of the study and its conclusions). And similar strategies may work for other platforms.\nThe question of how to to combat racism and hatred at large is one that is really too much for a major platform like Reddit or even Google or Facebook. The best they can hope to do is strike at it when and where it appears. But as ineffective as that might seem, it worked for Reddit and it may work elsewhere: bigotry is easy and those who cherish it are lazy. Make it difficult and many people may find it more trouble than it’s worth to harass, shame, and otherwise abuse online those different from themselves.", "tags": "racism,censorship", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/study-finds-reddits-controversial-ban-of-its-most-toxic-subreddits-actually-worked/", "id": "1539062"}, {"title": "Even more US adults now getting news from social media, says Pew", "text": "New research by Pew suggests there has been another increase in the proportion of U.S. adults getting news via social media platforms.\nIn May last year the researcher reported that 62 per cent of American adults were obtaining news from tech platforms, saying 18 per cent were doing so often. Now, in it’s latest survey, it says two-thirds (67%) of U.S. adults are reporting getting at least some of their news on social media. While a fifth (20%) report doing so “often”.\nAnd while it’s not a huge increase, it is nonetheless a rise (Pew terms it a “modest” increase).\nAnd a concerning one, given that the main social media purveyor of news — Facebook — has a demonstrable disinterest in and/or incapacity to distinguish fact from nonsensical fiction on its platform.\nIndeed, as many have already pointed out Facebook’s business benefits from increased user engagement, and made-up stories that play to people’s prejudices and/or contain wild, socially divisive claims have been shown to be able to clock up far more Facebook views than factual reports of actual news.\nSo any rise in news consumption on social media should give pause for thought — especially as Facebook (and Google, principally) continues to suck ad revenue away from traditional media outlets, threatening the sustainability of businesses that have traditionally played a key role in a functioning democracy.\nPew’s survey is based on responses from 4,971 U.S. adults who are members of the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel. The research was carried out between August 8-21, 2017.\nIt said it found that growth in news consumption across social media platforms is being driven by increases among Americans who are “older, less educated and non-white” — noting that for the first time in Pew Research Center surveys more than half (55%) of Americans aged 50 or older report getting news on social media sites — up 10 percentage points from 2016.\nPew found that three of the social media platforms it asked about in 2017 — Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat — had an increase in the share of their audience that gets news on each site.\nAbout three-quarters (74%) of Twitter users reported getting news on the site, up 15 percentage points from early 2016.\nWhile about a third of YouTube’s users (32%) now get news from the site, up from 21% in early 2016 — so a rise of 11 percentage points.\nAnd consuming news also rose among Snapchat’s user base — with 29% currently saying they are doing this, up from 17% in early 2016, so an increase of 12 percentage points.\nStill, Facebook remains the primary social media platform for sourcing news for the U.S. population as a whole — with just under half (45%) of all U.S. adults reporting they get news on the site (aka a large majority — 68% — of Facebook’s user base).\nHow times change. Just a year ago Facebook was pooh-poohing the notion that the social mega-platform is playing the role of a media company. ‘We are mere tech platform’ was the refrain in September 2016, despite how its algorithms select and order news-related content for billions of users.\nBy December, and following the fake news backlash after the US election result, that line was approaching the breaking point of credibility, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded Facebook might indeed be a media company — though he suggested it’s not a ‘traditional’ one.\nAnd that is surely true. No other media entity on Earth has enjoyed such vast reach and power.\nLittle wonder Russian agents spied potential to sew social division across the U.S. population as the country was headed into the salient point of an election cycle by purchasing, targeting and distributing politically charged ads via the platform — as Facebook this week revealed had been the case.\nIt reported that an in-house investigation found pro-Kremlin entities appear to have purchased around $100,000 in political marketing on the platform between 2015 and 2016.\nThe company has so far resisted pressure to publicly reveal the ads purchased by Russian entities.\nReturning to Pew’s report, its survey also found news consumption growing among YouTube’s (also growing) user-base — saying the Google/Alphabet-owned user generated video platform is now the second most common social media site for news, with roughly two-in-ten (18%) of all U.S. adults getting news there.\nFor Twitter, Pew said that while a very large share of its users (74 per cent) obtain news via the site, given that its user base is also significantly smaller than Facebook’s or YouTube’s this results in a smaller overall reach for news: With just 11% of U.S. adults get news via Twitter.\nThe researcher concluded that Americans are now more likely than ever to report getting news from multiple social media sites — with around a quarter of all U.S. adults (26%) getting news from two or more sites, up from 18% in 2016.\nIn additional research it also said its data shows the Internet is closing in on television as a source of news. As of August 2017, 43% of Americans report often getting news online, compared with 50% who often get news on television — so just a seven-percentage-point gap. While in early 2016 the gap between the two news platforms was 19 points.\nSo, in short, the Internet’s social platform giants are busily consuming broadcast/TV news media, not just print.", "tags": "pew,united-states,social-media,digital-media", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/09/even-more-us-adults-now-getting-news-from-social-media-says-pew/", "id": "1538357"}, {"title": "Facebook adds a dedicated ‘Movies’ section offering showtimes and ticket sales", "text": "Some Facebook users have noticed a new section called “Movies” appearing in the mobile app’s main navigation. The feature, which has just appeared for many U.S. Facebook users, offers a way to see which movies are playing nearby, available showtimes and a list of local theaters and their movie selections. The section is powered through an integration with Fandango’s and Atom Tickets’ booking services, which means you can also buy a movie ticket right from the “Movies” section itself.\nThis is not the first time Facebook has powered movie ticket sales, to be clear.\nLast fall, it introduced a way for visitors to Facebook Pages to take various actions, like getting quotes, buying event tickets from Ticketmaster and buying movie tickets, among other things. At the time, the movie ticket sales were being made possible through a partnership with Fandango, and had begun with just a few titles in U.S. theaters, like The Magnificent Seven, Storks and others.\nThe interface for those movie ticket sales from Facebook Pages looks just like the one you’ll see from the Facebook app’s “Movies” section, currently.\n\nThat indicates this is more of an expansion of the existing relationship with Fandango, rather than something entirely new to Facebook. That is, instead of having to visit an individual movie’s Facebook Page to start the purchasing process, you can just go to a single destination in the Facebook app. That makes it simpler to see all the movies playing nearby and complete your transaction.\nFor Fandango, its interest in working with Facebook went beyond purchasing ease, Paul Yanover, Fandango’s president, told The New York Times last fall. It was also about the ability to connect groups of friends who would go see movies together.\n\nBut for Facebook, the feature is now one of many that have launched in its main navigation in recent months, as the social network is shaping up to become a portal that offers anything you’d need online. In other words, Facebook wants to keep you in its app instead of having you turn to Google, or seek out other mobile apps to perform a task, get information, use a service, etc.\nFor example, the company has added features to its app’s main navigation that include a way to order food delivery; a Town Hall for connecting with local, state and national government representatives; access to your daily weather and forecast; an Explore feed for finding new Facebook Pages you might like; a selection of trending news items; a way to watch the top Live videos; a QR code scanner; a Wi-Fi finder; easier access to Safety Check; a networking-focused “Discover People” section; and many other options. And that’s not the complete list.\nWe understand that the Facebook “Movies” button is considered a test, and has been slowly expanding to users across the U.S.\nThat means some of you will have seen this option long before now, while others are only newly seeing it. It’s very difficult to tell when Facebook actually launches new features, because of how it tests products with small audiences, then larger ones and then sometimes decides to yank the feature or make it publicly available.\nMovie tickets aren’t the only type of ticket that Facebook is selling these days, we should also note. Its “Marketplace” section is rolling out a “ticket sales” section, too, which allows local event hosts to promote their events inside Facebook’s Craigslist-like feature.\nPost updated 9/9/17, 9:30 AM ET, as an Atom Tickets integration has now gone live.\n ", "tags": "social,tickets,movies", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/facebook-adds-a-dedicated-movies-section-offering-showtimes-and-ticket-sales/", "id": "1538209"}, {"title": "Twitter enables account sharing in its mobile app, powered by TweetDeck Teams", "text": "TweetDeck Teams — a feature that lets users share access to Twitter accounts without having to share a password — will now work in the Twitter app for iOS and Android. This change will make it easier for those who run social media accounts for businesses and brands to post updates, check replies, send direct messages and more, without having to run a separate app.\nIf anything, however, the move could hint that Twitter is thinking of transitioning TweetDeck’s account management features to its main app. After all, many of TweetDeck’s more advanced features, like muting, search and list management, already exist on Twitter itself. It only makes sense that shared accounts would make their way over, too.\nTweetDeck hasn’t had a lot of attention since Twitter bought the app for $40 million back in 2011. Instead, following a small update in 2012, its features have slowly disappeared or failed to keep up with those on Twitter’s official clients. Twitter also shut down TweetDeck’s mobile apps a few years ago, then discontinued its Windows client last year. (Windows users were directed to use TweetDeck via the web.)\nMeanwhile, TweetDeck’s Mac app hasn’t been updated since mid-2015 on the Mac App Store.\nNow, one of TweetDeck’s bigger selling points is making its way over to Twitter, with this support for Teams.\nTwitter quietly announced the news on Thursday via a couple of tweets pointing to updated help documentation detailing how the feature works.\nBefore this change, admins and contributors could only use TweetDeck Teams accounts in TweetDeck itself, so this broadens their availability.\nAfter the Team is set up, users may be invited to join the Team via an email notification, a notification in TweetDeck or a push notification to Twitter for iOS and Android.

Instagram users have been able to share individual photo and video posts to their Facebook News Feeds for a long time now, though no content travels the other direction.\nInstagram Stories already has aggressive placement in its own app, appearing on a separate bar above normal Instagram posts. The company added the Snapchat copycat feature back in August 2016 and the feature’s popularity is likely largely the cause of Snapchat’s slowed growth in 2017.

Verrit is a fledgling media startup that’s aiming to provide a platform for Hillary supporters to look at infographics with quotes on them about stuff they agree with.\nVerrit got a big boost yesterday when Hillary herself tweeted out an endorsement of the platform to her nearly 18 million Twitter followers.\nFor Clinton supporters the site aims “to become their trusted source of political information and analysis; to provide them (and anyone like-minded) sanctuary in a chaotic media environment; to center their shared principles; and to do so with an unwavering commitment to truth and facts,” according to a blog post. The site frequently references “the 65.8 million,” i.e. the number of votes Clinton received in the 2016 election.\nShortly after the Hillary endorsement, the site suffered a cyber attack substantial enough to make it inaccessible for much of Sunday night. Today, it has returned with some added protection thanks to Cloudflare.\nCEO Peter Daou isn’t just a wayward founder who lucked into a Hillary endorsement of his product. He served as Clinton’s “Internet Director” in her 2008 presidential campaign and was a digital media strategist for her in years prior. After that he led ShareBlue, a left-leaning media site seemingly primed for those who find Salon to be a tad too centrist.\nHe seems to be excited about the attention from Verrit.\nPhilosophically, the site is a bit on the smug side, arguing that progressive-minded Hillary supporters need a home on the web away from the hustle and bustle of trolls and trump-ets to get their information. For those who were worried that other social media sites weren’t already echo chambers, Verrit basically codifies that into its mission. It wants to be a “sanctuary” for Hillary supporters.\nCreating a media organization that isn’t absorbed in the 24-hour news cycle and can take a step back to approach topics on a deeper level is certainly not a bad idea, but building one that is supposed to make up for the biases of the mainstream media against liberals in a purely reactionary tone with the explicit backing of former staff of Hillary Clinton doesn’t exactly seem to be a recipe to bringing about solutions to political turmoil.\nThen again, this is 2017 where products that espouse “free speech” as a central tenet are almost guaranteed to be hubs of hate speech. Just a couple weeks ago, social network Gab was booted from the Google Play store for failing to show “sufficient level of moderation.”\nEven so, Verrit has its own issues with user-generated opinions. The site’s commenting policy is a bit unsavory, suggesting that instead of just not allowing you to post a comment if you’re in violation of its policy, Verrit will actually change the text itself before posting. “We reserve the right to alter or remove terminology that violates our policy before publishing a comment.”\nThe site’s big deal is that each post is part of a larger system system for verifying news snippets, but it doesn’t really appear to solve anything other than that it comes from sources trusted by Verrit. Each Verrit infographic has a seven-digit code on the bottom which sources to the website as a way of linking the image to its sourcing.\nIt’s not exactly revolutionary and furthermore none of the sources are actually linked so if you really care you’ll have to scour the web to find where the claim is from, especially when it just tells you the name of the publication. Seeing “Source: CNN” isn’t necessarily going to inspire any faith from Trump supporters used to the President’s habit of spouting “fake news!” at stuff he doesn’t agree with. Then again, this site isn’t meant for those people, just the 65.8 million.\nEven though the interface functions pretty well, it’s not really clear whether Verrit’s format actually does a good job at conveying info. Some complex topics are pretty difficult to express succinctly and Verrit hasn’t exactly shown its deftness in doing so.\nVerrit has every hallmark of a “here today, gone tomorrow” media startup but that won’t stop similar ideas from going forth with similar mission statements while similarly failing to solve the political divide.\n“Verrit can only grow with the help of those whose values it reflects and serves,” a blog post reads. “…Together we can reject revisionism and tell our own story with integrity and honesty.”\nHmm.", "tags": "hillary-clinton", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/if-a-hillary-backed-media-platform-is-techs-best-solution-to-fake-news-then-were-screwed/", "id": "1535869"}, {"title": "Facebook fights fake news with links to other angles", "text": "Facebook will become the suggester of perspective to avoid being the “arbiter of truth”. It’s rolling out “Related Articles” that appear below news links to stories lots of people are posting about on Facebook, or that are suspected to be false news and have been externally fact checked by Facebook’s partners. Appearing before someone reads, Related Articles will surface links to additional reporting on the same topic to provide different view points, and to truthiness reports from the fact checkers.\nIf users see drastically different angles when they compare a story to its Related Articles, they might deem it suspicious and skip it, be less likely to believe or share it, or could click through the Related Articles and make up their own mind. That could reduce the spread and impact of false news without Facebook itself having to be the honesty police. Related Articles could also balance out some of the radical invective that can subtly polarize the populace.\nPre-click Related Articles are rolling out in the US, Germany, France, and Nederlands today. These countries were chosen to get the roll out first because Facebook has established fact checking partnerships there. “We don’t want to be and are not the arbiters of the truth. The fact checkers can give the signal of whether a story is true or false” says Facebook News Feed integrity product manager Tessa Lyons.\nMeanwhile, Facebook’s machine learning algorithm has improved its accuracy and speed, so the social network  will now have it send more potential hoaxes to fact checkers. Lyons explains that the speed is important because “The sooner we can get potential false new stories to fact checkers, the sooner that they can review them, and the more we reduce the number of people who are actually exposed to them.”\nFacebook has shown Related Articles after people click links since at least 2014. Even then it was getting flack for dispensing fake news. In April of this year Facebook tested the new pre-click version as part of its multi-prong attack on fake news following criticism that misinformation influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That includes downranking hoaxes and click bait, reducing referral traffic to ad-filled spam sites to cut off their funding, and promoting local journalism and news literacy. Most directly, it partnered with Snopes, AP, PolitiFact and others external agencies so it can add warning labels to stories externally vetted as false.\n“People told us that Related Articles gave them more context about topics and that having more context helps them make more informed decisions and about what they read and what they decide to share” Lyons tells me. “Seeing Fact Checker’s articles in Related Articles actually helps people identify whether what they’re reading is misleading or false.”\n\nFacebook won’t be personalizing the Related Articles that show a column of thumbnail images and headlines below a link story. However, it does utilize other quality signals from News Feed ranking to show the optimal alternative takes. Thankfully, Lyons says Facebook doesn’t plan to put any ads in the Related Articles box.\nSo how does Facebook avoid accidentally showing more fake news in Related Articles? Facebook tells me it uses the same signals as its Trending section, and disqualifies posts that lots of people are commenting on or reporting as false. No humans are involved in the process, which at least removes the potential for direct bias, though humans tend to code their subconscious biases into their algorithms.\nIf Facebook can’t convince the world it’s got a real handle on the fake news problem, it may see people tune into the News Feed or click its links less. That interferes with Facebook’s ad-driven business model and its mission. Plus, it’s liable to get blamed for future election results.\nWhile objectively fake news gets the majority of the attention, it’s exaggeration and warped opinion that are much more prevalent and therefore potentially polarizing. If extreme right and left publishers’ articles get paired with centrist Related Articles, it could dissuade people from blindly swallowing the rants and raves that tear society apart.", "tags": "fake-news", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/facebook-related-articles/", "id": "1522949"}, {"title": "‘Paranormal Activity’ director Oren Peli launches a new social app", "text": "Oren Peli, who wrote and directed the enormously successful film Paranormal Activity, is launching a new iOS and Android app designed to help users create, find and join local events.\nSpot‘s launch might be doubly surprising — not only is Peli launching an app, but it seems like an odd idea to come from someone best known for horror movies (he also produced the Paranormal Activity sequels and the Insidious films).\nHowever, Peli told me that before moving into movies, he actually started his career as a developer of animation software and video games. So in some ways, he’s simply returning to his old career.\nThe app also addresses a problem Peli said he was facing after finding himself single again and feeling that standard one-on-one coffee dates were starting to feel “a little monotonous.” What if, instead, there was an app that helped people connect around shared activities and interests?\nThere have plenty of startups sitting in the intersection of social, local and mobile, enough that the industry spawned its own obnoxious buzzword, but Peli is hoping Spot can rise above the rest by making it as simple as possible to join these events.\n\nThe Spot app allows people to create events in four categories: Hobbies, sports, community events and singles events. You can search for events by keyword, or just bring up a map showing what’s nearby. Events can be public or private, they’re shareable via social media and participants can chat with each other through the app.\n“Spot’s technology means I can create events for just a few people or large events,” Peli said. “It’s an easy way to say, ‘Hey, I want to go hiking this afternoon, does anyone want to come with me?’ ”\nWhen asked about safety, Peli noted that users create a Spot account by connecting to Facebook, Google or email, and they also can earn a verified user sticker by verifying their phone number over SMS. In addition, event organizers can ban users from their events and report inappropriate behavior.\nStill, it seems like Spot is taking a fairly hands-off approach to the issue.\n“I think that with a little bit of common sense, we can have a very nice and positive community,” Peli said. “We won’t allow anything unpleasant. If anyone’s harassing anyone, we’ll take care of that [by warning or banning users].”\nSpot is available globally, but Peli said the initial focus is on building a community in Los Angeles. The app is free. Eventually, Peli said Spot could make money through advertising and by featuring deals from local businesses.\nAs for whether Peli’s time in Hollywood has affected the way he’s approaching his new startup, he said it was really the other way around: “When I got into film with Paranormal Activity, my experience as a video game programmer made me comfortable with all the technological aspects of it.

Facebook’s response was to suspend her account.\nYou can read Oluo’s account of things here, including some screenshots of the type of abuse she was receiving. Twitter, she said, was responsive. Facebook, not so much.\nFacebook later reinstated her account, calling the suspension a “mistake.” I’ve asked the company for the rationale behind the suspension.\nWe talked with another activist recently, Leslie Mac, who like Oluo spoke out on racism using the platform, and like Oluo was suspended from it. It happened to Shaun King, too, after he posted a racist email he received.\nThe pattern isn’t hard to figure out: when a person (often a person of color, often a woman, often both) is singled out by popular accounts and pages for something they’ve said or done, the mob descends. Abusive messages, comments and tweets arrive by the truckload — and while the target can only block and report so fast, groups of hundreds or thousands can flag a post or account so voluminously that it is taken offline.\nSure, that’s a “mistake.” The way the entire system Facebook has established for moderating the global conversation is a mistake. It is, at the very least, fundamentally flawed and inadequate.\nFacebook and other platforms love to talk about the empowering nature of a one-to-many platform. They fail to address the problem that occurs when the platform is inverted and becomes many-to-one.

It began to let Instant Article publishers show more ads, for example; it restored subscription options; it rolled out Page Like and email sign-up buttons; and it will begin tests of a paid subscription paywall feature in the fall.\nIt even tried to make adoption of Facebook’s format easier, by adding support for Google AMP and Apple News format as part of its Instant Articles software development kit.\nDespite the fact that Facebook doesn’t directly state that Instant Articles are about to get a big boost from this News Feed change, it’s pretty clear that will be the case.\nIt won’t necessarily rank Instant Articles any higher than other fast-loading sites, but it certainly means those publishers using Facebook’s mobile web format won’t have to worry that they’ll soon lose clicks.\n“We are not making this update to prioritize Instant Articles,”a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are making this update in response to what people have told us. We know that faster loading webpages are a better experience for people, both on Facebook and across the internet,” they said.\n\nAccording to Facebook’s announcement, the company will take into account the estimated load time of a webpage when someone clicks a link in the News Feed on the Facebook mobile app.\nIt will also consider other factors, like the user’s current network connection speed along with the general speed of the web page in question. If the link loads more quickly, then Facebook will make sure the link gets a higher position in your News Feed.\nWhen the updated News Feed algorithm is rolled out, Facebook warns that web pages that are “particularly slow” will likely see decreases in traffic. It did not, however, say how slow is too slow, pointing instead to a page detailing the best practices for improving mobile sites load time.\nThe company notes this is only one of many changes it has made to News Feed over the years to make things snappier for end users. For instance, in the past it changed the News Feed to display fewer videos when a user’s network connection speeds was slow. It also began to prefetch stories by downloading mobile content before links were clicked, when it identifying slower connection speeds.\nSlower loading web pages, of course, are frustrating for end users. As Facebook points out, on the broader web, as many as 40 percent of website visitors abandon a site if there’s a three-second delay.\nBut it’s a bit disingenuous to announce such a change to promote fast-loading sites without even a mention of Instant Articles.", "tags": "news-feed,publishers,instant-articles", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/facebook-will-soon-start-ranking-faster-loading-webpages-higher-in-news-feed/", "id": "1522560"}, {"title": "Hustle scores $8M to kill telemarketing with personalized texts", "text": "No one picks up the phone and everyone gets too much email. If you want to contact people for fundraising, a political campaign or marketing, texting is the way to go. But a generic mass text is more like spam than a convincing conversation.\nHustle lets you personalize every message and turn it into persuasive one-on-one dialogue. Like CRM for SMS, organizers can assign lists of contacts to their reps and field agents, who text them from their own numbers and cajole them to get down with the cause.\nThe potential to revolutionize both grassroots activism and corporate sales has won Hustle a new $8 million Series A led by existing investor Social Capital, whose founder Chamath Palihapitiya sits on Hustle’s board. That brings Hustle to over $11 million in funding to take the lessons it learned as Bernie Sanders’ texting tool for the 2016 presidential election and bring it to all kinds of organizations.\n\nCo-founder Roddy Lindsay explains that “People don’t pick up the phone as much any more. Having a one-on-one conversation on text is the best way to get people to participate.”\nLindsay is well-versed on measuring what engages people. For six years he worked as one of Facebook’s first data scientists. His penchant for politics shone through, as Lindsay helped run Facebook’s congressional hackathon on Capitol Hill.\nIn 2014, Lindsay hooked up with former Obama ’08 Nevada new media director Perry Rosenstein to form Hustle. [Disclosure: Rosenstein and I were two of the co-founders of a social meetup utility called Signal that shut down before Hustle’s creation.] They set out to build a communication tool that combined the intimacy and ability to compel action of phone calling or door-knocking with the affordability and scalability of text messaging.\n\nHere’s how Hustle works. Organizers build a phone number database, and write script templates on Hustle’s desktop app for the messages they want to send out. Their volunteers or representatives get assigned groups of contacts to ping through Hustle’s app, which automatically fills in variables in the scripts like the recipient’s name or how they got involved. The reps can rapidly send these messages via their own phone numbers, and reply like normal to answer questions or coax them into participation.\nAs respondents agree or decline to pledge money, show up to an event, volunteer or buy something, reps can mark their progress in Hustle’s analytics dashboard that tracks who they’ve contacted. And now Hustle is forging partnerships with payment processors and CRM systems to automatically track when recipients take action. Clients pay Hustle a monthly fee per contact in their database, starting at $0.30 per person.\nWhile Hustle launched with a focus on politics, Lindsay says “We’re starting to do a lot of stuff beyond campaigns and advocacy. Higher education is a big growth area for us.” Now 30 schools are using Hustle for fundraising, like soliciting alumni donations without annoying phone calls. Amherst was able to double participation in its young alumni fundraiser from 10 percent to 21 percent using Hustle.\nThose contracts have driven Hustle’s 40-person team to a $3 million annual recurring revenue runrate. And now Hustle has $8 million more to spend on accelerating growth. Joining Social Capital in the Series A are Canvas Ventures, Designer Fund, Foundation Capital, GSV Acceleration, Higher Ground Labs, Index Ventures, Kapor Capital, Matrix Partners, New Media Ventures, Omidyar Network, Twilio.org Impact Fund and Salesforce Ventures.\nThat last one could provide a well-aligned exit opportunity one day that could give Salesforce the same grip on text that its CRM has on email. “People respond to other people in a fundamentally different way than they respond to automated communication and bots,” Lindsay proclaims.\nThe cash will go first to building out Hustle’s platform and API so it can do more conversion tracking. That way, “If they say they’re going to give but haven’t yet, you can follow up,” says Lindsay. Hustle will also build out its sales and marketing teams for different verticals, growing its San Francisco, New York and DC offices. Its engineering team will grow, too, as it continues to support its iOS, Android, web and API surfaces.\nOf course, for all of texting’s influence, it’s still only a piece of the communications puzzle. Hustle will need to develop ways to mesh better with the rest of an organization’s outreach strategy. And it will have to fend off clones trying to undercut its pricing. Hillary Clinton’s campaign developed its own version called MegaPhone rather than pay for Hustle.\nThen there’s the issue that some people will still see Hustle’s texts as spam even if they’re sent by a real person from a real number. The startup may need to set frequency limits or usage restrictions to prevent clients from abusing Hustle.\n\nMost startups stay away from polarizing politics that could limit their business, but Hustle refused to stay neutral. “We’re focused on building a strong business supporting clients in the Democratic Party and Progressive movement, and expanding into markets like Higher Ed and relationship-driven enterprises,” Lindsay says.\nSupporting causes on both sides of the aisle could have gotten contentious, so Hustle chose the left. When ask if it refuses conservative clients, Lindsay admits that “If a potential client would violate our core values of Authenticity, Empowerment, Impact, and Respect, or erode the trust that our existing clients put in us, we would politely turn them away.”\nHustle is the kind of tech the world will need to claw back government from blustering leaders who exploit fear to divide people. Lindsay says Hustle wants “to make people feel like participants in the system and not just observers.” Motivated grassroots organizations can use Hustle to leverage the passion you see seething on Twitter into actual progress.\nBut that can’t wait until 2019. “Voter communication isn’t something you just need to do 30 days before the election,” Lindsay concludes. Whether it’s a campaign or a donation drive, people need to feel like there’s a person on the other end rooting them on like a personal trainer. Hustle conveniently puts that trainer in people’s text inbox.", "tags": "telemarketing,hustle", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/hustle-texting/", "id": "1522489"}, {"title": "Instagram Stories turns 1 as daily use surpasses Snapchat", "text": "Instagram Stories has blossomed from a Snapchat clone into an integral part of the world’s largest dedicated visual communication app in the first year since its launch. Half of the businesses on Instagram produced a story in the last month, and it’s boosted the app’s average usage to 32 minutes per day for those under 25, and 24 minutes per day for those 25 and up.\nIf Facebook’s goal was stop Snap in its tracks, it’s largely succeeded with Instagram Stories. Snapchat’s monthly active user growth rate has plummeted from 17.2% per quarter to just 5%, while Snap’s share price has fallen from its $17 IPO to $13. Instagram Stories now has 250 million daily users compared to Snapchat’s 166 million. Instagram’s usage per day beats the “more than 30 minutes per day” of usage Snapchat claims on average now, as well as the over 30 minutes per day for under 25s and 20 minutes per day for over 25s Snap cited in its IPO filing.\n[Update: News of Instagram surpassing Snapchat’s daily usage has caused Snap’s share price to sink to an all-time low aroun $12.67]\n\nIt’s clear to see why users are flocking to Instagram. It has stolen some of Snap’s primary use cases and party tricks. Instagram’s most popular augmented reality filter is the same as the Snap one it copied: virtual puppy ears. Also in the top five Instagram face filters are bunny ears at #3 and Koala ears at #5, both inspired by the meme-worthy popularity of Snap’s dog face. Meanwhile, Instagram keeps iterating with new features and sticker packs, like the one below to celebrate Instagram Stories’ first birthday.\nInstagram is actually getting more efficient at copying Snapchat. While it took almost 3 years to launch its own version of Stories, Instagram needed just 4 months to copy Snapchat’s create-your-own-stickers feature launched in April.\nInstagram not only copied Snapchat’s Stories, but has turned its Instagram Direct feature into a full-fledged Snapchat ephemeral private messaging competitor. By allowing people to send quick visual messages that disappear, Instagram Direct has grown to 375 million monthly users. Snap’s influence has helped Instagram’s chat feature one of the most popular messaging apps in the world behind WhatsApp, Messenger, and WeChat. Now one in five Instagram Stories posted by a business receives a Direct Message reply, allowing Instagram to seduce advertisers who want private channels for communicating with customers.\n\nInstagram writes that “Stories made Instagram a place for people to share all of their moments – the highlights and everything in between”. If CEO Kevin Systrom set out to make Instagram an app for displaying everything fun in your life, not just the perfectly polished meals and vacations, it’s succeeded. And for better or worse, Instagram Stories has emboldened Facebook to put Stories into all its apps. WhatsApp Status has boomed to 250 million daily users, while Facebook Stories and Messenger Day are seeing weaker traction since they’re respectively redundant or obtrusive.\nThe flood of apps where you can post them is creating ‘Stories fatigue’ in some users like me. If the audience is fractured across five different apps and I have to go through a ton of work to post to them all, I sometimes reconsider whether it’s worth disrupting life in the present in order to show off to my friends. So while Instagram and Facebook are further popularizing the Stories format Snap invented, they may also be commoditizing it. Either way, the Snap threat is being neutralized.\nUnless Snap can pull off a big uptick in growth when it reports earnings later this quarter, it may see Wall Street sour on its future the same way it did with Twitter. But you can bet Instagram won’t let up the heat.\nA year ago, it looked like Snapchat was destined to rule social media. Its full-screen sharing would be impossible to outdo. There was no way to give a more immersive window into friends’ lives. But Facebook and Instagram didn’t have to outdo Snapchat. They just needed to copy it and put it in a more convenient place in apps that people of all ages already use.", "tags": "instagram-stories,snapchat-clone", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/instagram-stories-anniversary/", "id": "1522463"}, {"title": "Snap hits record low after getting rejected from the S&P 500", "text": "Snap shares fell 4 percent and closed at a record low on Tuesday at $13.10, but it wasn’t just because of the dreaded lockup expiration, which allowed some insiders to finally sell shares.\nSnap faced another devastating blow when it was revealed that the company won’t make it into the S&P 500, a popular stock market index. The way Snap has divided up its classes of stock have made it ineligible under the new rules, which state “the S&P Composite 1500 and its component indices will no longer add companies with multiple share class structures.” It’s also ineligible for the FTSE Russell, a major British index, because Snap’s public investors don’t have voting rights.\nThis is bad news for Snap because a lot of people are investing in overall indices instead of individual stocks. “It can be a reasonably big source of demand for some of these companies,” said Sam Angus, a partner at Fenwick & West.\nThe last thing Snap needs right now is more bad news. After pricing its IPO at $17 per share in early March and seeing an initial bump in the stock market, it has mostly been in steep decline ever since. Tuesday’s closing price was less than half of the $27.09 we saw on March 3.\nSnap had a disappointing first quarter earnings results, so there’s extra pressure for it to outperform when it reports next week. Plus, many employees will not be eligible to sell shares until later this month at the next lockup expiration. If enough of them exercise their options, it will send the stock further in decline.\nBut some analysts think that the lockup fears have been overblown and that a lot of employees won’t sell shares yet. Plus, for many employees who joined in 2015 or later, their shares are underwater, so it wouldn’t make sense for them to sell yet.\nThe big question for Snap is whether it will be able to maintain user growth. Instagram copied its “stories” feature last year, which seemed to be a big blow to its service.\nYet Snap has proven to be innovative and could continue that trend. From disappearing messages to stories to AR-enhanced “lenses,” the company continues to have new ideas.

It’s intended to make video chat participants separated geographically feel like they’re together in the same space, the report claims.\nBloomberg’s report also claims Building 8 is developing a separate smart speaker product, similar to Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, which would use a voice assistant developed by the social network provider. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg developed his own home voice assistant as part of a project resulting from his annual resolutions, which in 2016 focused on building a smart home companion similar to Jarvis from Iron Man.\nThis isn’t the first we’ve heard of a smart speaker in development at Facebook – a report last week sourced from DigiTimes suggested that the company’s supply chain sources indicated a smart speaker with an integrated 15-inch display was on track for a potential first quarter 2018 launch.\nBased on the details of this new report, it sounds like the smart speaker and device with a 15-inch display may actually be two separate products. The 15-inch screen would fit with this fresh suggestion of a device with a laptop-sized screen tailored for video chat, at least.\nBloomberg also says the video chat gadget will include a wide-angle camera, built-in microphones and speakers, with artificial intelligence tech used to improve its photographic (offering zoom and lock features on people’s faces) and audio performance. In testing, it’s being supported by a thin stand that supports the display, which could reportedly be between 13 and 15-inches in size. FB is said to be considering Android for the OS, rather than its own in-house operating system.\nFacebook has also tested a 360-degree camera for the device, which would fit with their push to bring 360 video to their social platform, but that won’t be ready in time for its initial planned product launch. It’s reportedly set to retail for “a few hundred dollars,” Bloomberg reports, with the standalone smart speaker aiming to sell for somewhere around $100; that speaker could be sidelined entirely, too, if Facebook decides to focus entirely on the video chat hardware.\nA video chat device could make sense for Facebook in a number of ways, including as a way to lower the friction of video chat to make it accessible to a broad user base, rather than making it an additional service that requires logins and apps on platforms designed for general purpose use.

Now the company is moving into video editing, with the launch of its first video editing tool on iOS. The tool will allow users to apply presets and tools to any size video from their smartphone camera, then share the resulting creation across social media.\nThe new tool takes advantage of SENS, the company’s proprietary real-time image processor, and supports all iOS video formats up to 30 FPS at 4k and 60 FPS at 1080 or below with no size or length restrictions, the company tells us.\nIts SENS technology platform is being positioned as a differentiator here, in terms of VSCO’s capabilities, as it moves into video editing. Prior to now, the platform is what allowed the company to roll out support for the high-quality RAW file format in iOS, and the addition of short video clips within the app, according to VSCO co-founder and CEO Joel Flory, talking about SENS in an interview with Fast Company this June.\nHowever, the video editing tool won’t be available to everyone who has the VSCO app installed – it’s a feature rolling out to paid “VSCO X” members only.\nVSCO X is the company’s annual membership service, which charges users $19.99 per year for those who want access to new features on a monthly basis, including presets, tools, educational offerings and more.\nThe video editing tool will initially become available to VSCO X members on iOS, ahead of its launch on Android, says VSCO.\nTo use the feature, members launch the app then tap the banner in their Studio where the video editing tool is being announced.\nVideos from your phone’s Camera Roll will then appear here in the Studio, and you can choose the one you want to edit. You can use presets from the VSCO X library to edit the video along with other standard editing tools, like Contrast or Saturation. When your edits are complete, you can save video back your Camera Roll, where you can choose to share it out to other social platforms.\n“VSCO’s mission is to help people become better creators, and video is a creative frontier we’re increasingly passionate about and focused on,” explains Flory, of the new tool’s launch. “Video editing for VSCO X members is a first step into what we see as limitless possibilities for video editing tools on VSCO.”\nVSCO today has an active community in its app, which consists primarily of younger people, the company notes. Eighty-eight percent of its monthly users are millennials or generation Z, and 70 percent of the community is creating daily. The company reported at the beginning of last year it had passed a key milestone by surpassing 30 million monthly active users in its app.\nAt the time, VSCO hinted it would expand its product and platform into new areas in the future.

The closest it came to experimenting with other formats was with the launch of the GIF-making DSCO, which was folded into the main VSCO app in February.\nThe iOS version of the app is a free download here on the App Store.

Usually this requires hardware devices. Now a New York-based startup thinks it’s come up with an approach based on specially developed algorithms and machine learning using simple heartbeat readings taken with a smartphone app.\nWelltory (iOS, Android) has also now closed its second investment round, raising $1 million from business angels. This is being used to launch the next version of the app, which is aimed at cutting down your stress levels and boosting your productivity. Luckily the app is, in my opinion, a joy to use in terms of interface and over-all usability.\nHere’s their idea: Google Analytics for humans, complete with AB-testing features and KPI goals. The idea is to work out the effect of how, for instance, morning meditation, working from home or a diet change might affect stress and energy levels. You then keep what works for you and discard what doesn’t.\nWhile the main measurement comes through measuring your heartbeat, using the same PPG technology found in most pulse oximeters, it then applies variability algorithms to assess the state of the “autonomic nervous system” — the body’s stress and recovery regulation center. That’s how they come up with stress and energy levels.\nIn fact, this is the same technique used by professionals in sports. The Red Wings hockey team relies on HRV analysis to track training and recovery with Firstbeat. Similarly, NBA players like DeAndre Jordan and Matthew Dellavedova wear HRV-based WHOOPs during games.\n\nBut Welltory is aiming to bring this kind of monitoring to the masses.\nCompetitors in this space are usually hardware-based, such as the aforementioned WHOOP (which is a $500 device) and Firstbeat, which has several hardware partners.\nWelltory is free as a basic version, but the paid version of the Welltory app has a Quantified Self Dashboard, which lets users collect data about their lifestyles.\nIt also can be synced with fitness trackers and Fitbits, Apple Health and Google Fit to collect data about sleep, nutrition and physical activity. It also supports RescueTime (a desktop-based productivity tracker), home weather stations that track your surroundings and more.\nOver time it generates charts for you to work out correlations between behaviors. So for instance, you can see if walking an extra mile a day helps stress levels, or see if meditation sessions are affected by the weather that day.\nJane Smorodnikova, co-founder, says the “Quantified Self” remains a mystery to most, so bringing all the data together in one interface helps explain it. “They can see how their activity influences their stress, how many hours of sleep they need to recover properly and what lifestyle habits influence their productivity at work. Stress and energy measurements is the key that connects the dots of your lifestyle data and makes it easy to get real insights.”\nWelltory says it currently has 125,000 users and 650,000+ heart rate variability measurements. It’s also got a healthy growth in paid users.\nCo-founders Alexander Lyskovsky, Jane Smorodnikova and Pavel Pravdin are all quantified self aficionados who come from engineering backgrounds who wanted an approach based on science and hard data.

The maximum penalty for this new offense will be an unlimited fine.\nDigital minister Matt Hancock described the plans, published yesterday in draft form and following an earlier consultation, as a “balance between supporting innovation and data protection”.\n“Our measures are designed to support businesses in their use of data, and give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account,” he said in a statement. “The new Data Protection Bill will give us one of the most robust, yet dynamic, set of data laws in the world.\n“The Bill will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use, and prepare Britain for Brexit. We have some of the best data science in the world and this new law will help it to thrive.”\nAnother new offense set to be created under the law is the altering of records with intent to prevent disclosure following a subject access request — this will also carry an unlimited fine in England and Wales.\nThe UK’s data protection agency is also set to get sharper teeth as a consequence of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which ramps up the size of the fines that can be levied by regulators for data protection breaches.\nCurrently in the UK the maximum fine the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) can issue is £0.5M. (Last year the agency issued a then-record fine of £0.4M to ISP TalkTalk for a 2015 data breach.)\nLarger fines of up to £17M (€20M) or 4 per cent of global turnover will be allowed under the new rules — which the government says will enable the ICO to “respond in a proportionate manner to the most serious data breaches”.\nThe GDPR also shrinks the time-window when organizations are required to report serious data breaches to the ICO — down to within 72 hours.\n“Businesses must notify the ICO within 72 hours of a data breach taking place, if the breach risks the rights and freedoms of an individual. In cases where there is a high risk, businesses must notify the individuals affected,” the government notes on this.\nCompanies also face obligations under the GDPR to conduct risk assessments if they carry out “high risk data processing” — in order to “understand the risks involved and mitigation required to prevent inappropriate usage”.\nIn a statement on the UK proposals, information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: “We are pleased the government recognizes the importance of data protection, its central role in increasing trust and confidence in the digital economy and the benefits the enhanced protections will bring to the public.”\nDenham publicly condemned WhatsApp parent Facebook last year, after the company landed in regulatory hot water in Europe following a major change to the privacy policy of WhatsApp’s messaging platform that saw users’ data shared and linked with Facebook’s other data holdings, including for ad targeting purposes.\nAt the time of the privacy policy change, WhatsApp users were presented with a pre-ticked box consenting to the sharing of the data with Facebook — a move that drew widespread condemnation from data protection and privacy advocates.\n“The reliance on default opt-out or pre-selected ‘tick boxes’, which are largely ignored, to give consent for organisations to collect personal data will also become a thing of the past,” the government asserts now, in its proposals to update domestic DP law.\nThe GDPR is due to come into force across the EU in May 2018, and much of the UK plans for updating domestic data protection rules are aimed at achieving alignment with the pan-European regulation. Even though the UK voted last year to leave the bloc, it remains an EU member during the two-year exit negotiation process and therefore must comply with EU law.\nBeyond that, and when it comes to data protection rules specifically, the UK’s stated desire for a continued trade and information sharing relationship with the EU in the future — i.e. after it is no longer a member — essentially requires continued compliance with the bloc’s data protection standards.\nHancock himself said as much earlier this year, when he told a committee that the government wanted to ensure “unhindered data flows after Brexit”, which he said essentially meant “matching” the EU’s data protection rules, rather than the UK trying to strike out and set its own standards.\nIn the statement of intent for the new data protection bill, Hancock details how the government intends to handle some areas of permitted derogation from the GDPR — for example it plans to set the age at when a child can legally give consent for their data to be processed at 13 (the GDPR allows Member States to set an age between 13 and 16, though sets its own default at 16).\nThe UK also intends to continue to allow organisations other than those vested with official authority to process personal data on criminal convictions and offenses in “certain specified circumstances” — an existing regime which it says has enabled, for example, employers to perform “accurate criminal records checks”, and the underwriting of driving insurance.\nAnd says it “will take a similar approach to that taken for the processing of special (i.e. sensitive) categories of personal data”.\nAnother exemption the government intends to exercise is to allow scientific or historical research organisations which gather statistics or organisations performing archiving functions in the public interest to be exempted from obligations to provide rights of access of individuals to the data held on them and obligations to rectify inaccurate personal data upon notification — although it notes this will only be the case “if compliance would seriously impair these organisations’ ability to carry out research, archiving or statistics-gathering activities”.\nIt also intends to exercise an exemption on automated individual decision-making. While the GDPR states that an individual has the right not to be the subject of a purely automated decision making process, it does allow for exemptions — “where suitable measures are put in place to safeguard the individual’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests”.\n“Individuals will have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to them which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects them, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention,” the government notes.\nThe statement also confirms the government intends to legislate to provide for an expanded and modernized data protection framework specifically for national security purposes — an area that lies outside the scope of the GDPR.\nThis will be based on a revised Council of Europe convention, with the government saying it plans to introduce data protection standards “that reflect the huge growth in data and changes in technology”, and ensure “data is processed, not only lawfully, but ethically”.", "tags": "law,general-data-protection-regulation,information,terms-of-service", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/uk-to-criminalize-re-identifying-anonymized-personal-data/", "id": "1524533"}, {"title": "Digital bank Tandem to acquire banking arm of UK’s famous luxury department store Harrods", "text": "Following rumours that began circulating within London’s fintech community as far back as June, digital-only or so-called ‘challenger’ bank Tandem has announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Harrods Bank, the banking arm of the U.K.’s most famous luxury department store. Terms of the deal aren’t being disclosed, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval.\nUnder the agreement, Tandem says it will acquire 100 per cent of Harrods Bank and benefit from around £80 million of capital coming into the business. On completion — and presuming U.K. regulators don’t wave a red flag — Harrods bank will operate under the Tandem brand.\nIn addition, Tandem says the acquisition will accelerate the launch of savings accounts to customers, pegged for before the end of the year. Tandem’s app — which doesn’t yet offer a bank account but instead is a Personal Finance Manager (PFM) of sorts. designed to help you manage your money — is available in the iOS App and Google Play Stores, whilst Tandem credit cards are set for launch in “the next few months”.\nAccording to City AM, the acquisition will give Tandem a much-needed push against a number of other rival U.K. challenger banks, such as Atom, Starling and Monzo, “with a near-£200m loan book and over £300m of deposits,” even if Harrods Bank, owned by Qatar Holdings, is itself loss-making.\nThe proposed deal also comes after a somewhat shaky time for Tandem. Last December it announced that it had secured a £35 million investment from department store House of Fraser, owned by China’s Sanpower. However, restrictions on capital leaving China led to part of the investment being withdrawn and Tandem eventually losing its own banking license and having to re-jig the business, including layoffs. Acquiring an existing licensed bank may be a quicker way to get its own regulatory status back on track.\nUpdate: Given that Tandem recently lost a significant part of its funding, I asked the startup bank to clarify what it meant by benefiting from “around £80 million of capital coming into the business” — specifically if that was referring to new investment and/or Harrods Bank’s balance sheet.

With over 65 million refugees globally (according to the UN), and their ranks being swelled considerably by the civil war in Syria, it became clear to me that any solutions might help refugees would have to be scalable. Scaling solutions to problems is what the tech industry does, which is why Techfugees acts as a bridge between the tech community and the needs of refugees and refugees NGOs.\nAnd that bridge is gradually getting closer.\nNot only are individuals in the tech community getting involved, creating many open-sources projects, but private-sector tech startups are bringing their amazing solutions to these problems. I mean, if you can get your laundry done and delivered to your door, or order food or a limo with a smartphone, how transformational would it be to teach a refugee child the language of their host country, or help them integrate into a new country faster? Refugees have also been creating their own tech projects themselves, from the Syrian refugee answer to Etsy, Sharqi, to the app to help refugees navigate German bureaucracy. In Australia, a Techfugees hackathon helped give life to RefugeeTalent, a platform built by and for recently arrived refugees, and Refuhelp in France (below).\n\nThat’s why a new initiative from Unbabel, the Lisbon-based and Y Combinator-backed startup that combines machine learning with crowdsourced human translations, is so great.\nVasco Pedro, CEO and co-founder, has now launched Unbabel.org, a non-profit portal providing the company’s high-quality translation services to NGOs and charities free of charge. This will aim to remove language barriers and provide seamless communication for refugees worldwide.\nUnbabel.org says it is already working with a number of organizations, including SPEAK which assists migrants in acclimating to their new community.\nThe startup has also partnering with Universidad Europa (Madrid) professors leading the Bachelor’s Degree program in Translation and Interpreting, who work with organizations such as UNICEF. By combining the power of students enrolled in the program with the technology provided by Unbabel.org, this initiative can be scaled to provide increased translations.\nHere’s a short video about the initiative:\n\nThe company is now actively seeking additional charities and NGOs to partner with in order to provide necessary translation services to refugees, from helping them translate official documents to receive proper status, to aiding them in translating CVs to the local language to help with their job search.\nLuckily Unbabel is not the only tech startup offering their services to refugees and refugee NGOs.\nBabbel, another language startup out of Berlin, has donated courses budgeted at over €1M for refugee projects. And it’s also giving Babbel out for free to various initiatives, such as organizing in-house training for voluntary language teachers in refugee homes. In fact, it’s linguists have written up some great tips for people who want to help refugees learn languages in a series.\nIn the US, bigger companies like Airbnb have stepped up to the plate to allow hosts to join an Airbnb community who are providing free accommodation to those in need, enabling them to resettle their lives.\nMeanwhile, ride-tracking startup Rydar is now offering any refugee contacting them through the app to use their service free for one year, giving them the opportunity to save money on ride-sharing services.\nTechfugees has been gradually compiling a database of tech resources in this area, which is hope to turn into a sort of ‘CrunchBase for Refugee technology‘. But to give you a flavour, here are just a few of the other generous tech startups trying to aid refugees.\nSharood is offering to connect the refugees community to a place by sharing meals.\nFunzi is a mobile learning startup geared specifically to emerging markets where refugees are typically located.\nSolidarityApp allows you to donate to refugee causes when you download mobile games.\nPoint93, which helps people open online stores on Shopify, are donating their services free to refugees.\nThe telemedicine company Doxy.me are providing their platform for refugees to use for free through a project called HealthPath.\nRedi-School is free of charge and teaching refugees in Berlin to code\nLondon-based startup Bussu offers Premium Membership open to refugees who apply here.\nEsri provides NGOs access to their mapping software.\nThere are of course many other tech companies doing good work in this area.\nIn a future separate post, I will be covering many of the specific tech initiatives to help refugees that have sprung up over the last couple of years.\nPicture: Getty Images", "tags": "unbabel", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/the-growing-band-of-startups-donating-their-platforms-to-refugees/", "id": "1524095"}, {"title": "FaceApp adds paid selfie styling effects", "text": "Face-morphing app FaceApp, which uses a neural network for editing selfies in a photorealistic fashion, has updated its iOS and Android apps to what it’s calling FaceApp 2.0 — further fleshing out its monetization play with a Pro version that contains a series of selfie styling/beautifying filters.\nThe app became a bit of a viral hit earlier this year, off the back of a set of free filters that let people radically change the appearance of a selfie or portrait photo, including adding a toothy smile, switching genders, and dialing age appearance way up or way down.\nIt also ran into some race controversy over a ‘hotness’ filter which had originally been included in the app, after people found it was lightening skin tone as one of its ‘beautifying’ effects — leading to accusations of prejudice.\nThe founder subsequently apologized for what he described as an “unfortunate side-effect of the underlying neural network caused by the training set bias” — and the offending filter was renamed, while the team worked on a fix.\nv2 of the app still includes a selection of free filters (though no longer a ‘hotness’ filter), grouped together under the heading “fun”. There’s also a new section called ‘Style’, which requires a Pro upgrade.\nThe face-altering effects being offered here are more obviously aimed at burnishing and beautifying the appearance of selfies, which FaceApp is hoping people will be willing to pay for, including a “makeup” filter and a “hipster”, goatee-adding option.\nv2 of the app also includes support for face-morphing full-size photos, and a refreshed UI.\n\n“Before this update, you could upgrade to the Pro version to get some extra features (e. g. remove watermarks) and turn off ads,” notes founder and CEO Yaroslav Goncharov. “The feedback we got is that there are a lot of people that are ready to pay for our app but expect to get new filters in return.”\nGoncharov won’t disclose any new usage metrics for FaceApp at this point, but says since its initial release in January it’s had more than 45 million downloads.\nWhether many users can be convinced to shell out for a few selfie beautifying effects remains to be seen, as there are a lot of existing apps that offer such effects — including multiple makeup apps/apps for smoothing and softening skin tone, and/or giving you a stylized cute/kawaii look (e.g. long-time Chinese app Meitu).\nWhereas FaceApp grabbed initial attention for the novelty of its more radical alterations, such as a gender swapping feature which has led to the strange (and sometimes) public pass of men longing to meet their female selves. And women creating female versions of leading men in the Trump administration…\nClearly these novelty filters have helped raise FaceApp’s profile. It’s less clear whether a reputation for silly and/or uncanny valley neural network effects will translate into lots of paying customers for rather more subtle selfie alterations.\nWe also haven’t had a chance to test out FaceApp’s new style features, so can’t assess how well they stack up against existing selfie beautifying apps. The hipster goatee does at least sound a bit different — if not necessarily something lots of people would be willing to pay for. Especially as pricing for Pro looks pretty steep; it’s listed as $20. (Update: $19.99 is for a lifetime subscription; there’s also a $1.99 monthly subscription; or $9.99 per year option.)\nAsked if they are confident they’ve fully fixed the race controversy issue, Goncharov says that avoiding the pitfall of algorithmic bias is something that requires ongoing attention.\n“When dealing with such complex algorithms and neural networks, it would be naive and even irresponsible to declare such an issue completely fixed. It is an ongoing process,” he tells TechCrunch.\n“What I can say is that we are committed to keeping this issue in mind at all phases of our product cycle from creating datasets and training neural networks to quality assurance and processing customer feedback.

This is an AI-powered ‘in-app mediation technology’ which claims to predict supply and demand. It’s acquirer is Mozoo, a london-based mobile monetisation specialist.\nMozoo is essentially self-funded and growth has been driven by profitability. It did not raise funds to finance the deal, it borrowed money from banks (BNP Paribas and BPI France) and historical angel investors including Very and Alclan.\nMozoo received one round of seed investment back in 2011, which was less than a million. The $20m figure is comprised of upfront and earn outs in debt and convertibles. The rest, approximately 30% of the total, comes from shares of Mozoo.

European VC Northzone led the round, with participation from existing investors, such as Rocket Internet’s Global Founders Capital (GFC) and Picus Capital. The Munich-based company plans to use the funding to further develop its Software-as-a-Service and become a leader in the HR software space for small and medium-sized (SME) companies.\nFounded in 2015 and “bootstrapped” to nearly 100 customers in the first one and a half years, before taking a seed round from Global Founders Capital and a few business angels last summer, Personio now claims over 400 customers and counts over 50 employees. SMEs use the platform to manage all of their HR and recruitment processes, benefiting from what the startup describes as a single view of employee management.\n“On the highest level we are digitizing HR and Recruiting for SMEs to reduce administrative workload and allow HR managers to work on value-adding topics,” Personio co-founder and CEO Hanno Renner tells TechCrunch. “More specifically we are building an end-to-end HR Operating System that covers all processes along the employee life-cycle (recruit, manage and develop)”\nThe result is described by Renner as a “central hub for all HR data,” and is seeing the company take a platform approach by integrating with vertical players in the HR space to provide customers with “the ease of only having to track information about their people at one place and then pushing them via our API”.\nConcrete examples of areas covered by Personio include: a full applicant tracking system, with support for multi-posting to over 100 job boards (e.g. Stepstone, Indeed, LinkedIn, etc); a digital employee file; document and contract management; on/off-boarding; attendance tracking; absence management; salary management & payroll; and performance management and feedback.\nRenner says that typical Personio customers are European companies between 10 and 1,000 employees. “However, our core segment is between 100-500 employees. Typical examples would be HelloFresh, Statista or Scalable Capital,” he adds.\nCompetitors are cited as Excel and paper-based files. Or more directly, European HR platforms, such as HiBob or HeavenHR, which have more of a focus towards employee benefits (similar to Zenefits in the U.S.). Instead, Renner says Personio is starting earlier in the employee life-cycle including recruiting, and provides a seamless transition of successful applicants into the HRM section.\n“A lot of our customers have therefore replaced for example BambooHR and Jobvite to have everything in one tool. Besides the all-in-one approach, our main differentiator is customisability of all processes as well as a strong focus on data privacy which is critical given the sensitive information our customers store in Personio,” he adds.\nUnlike many of the other new HR startups, which offer their wares for free but make money selling benefits and insurances, Personio is employing a classic SaaS-subscription model.

The teenagers were asked to wear a Fitbit Charge wristband for eight weeks; to use the Fitbit app; and to take part in surveys and focus groups, before and after the trial period ended, responding to questions about how they felt about exercising and using the device.\nThe researchers had expected the wearable to have a positive impact on encouraging teens to exercise across a range of different forms of motivation, as well as hypothesizing it would help avoid kids feeling demotivated about physical activity.\nHowever, while the researchers record an initial “novelty” bump in interest in physical activity among some participants “for the first few weeks”, the results of the full study were the opposite of encouraging — with participants overall reporting feeling less confident about their competence at exercising, and ultimately discouraged from doing so.\n“It was consistently reported that after about 4 weeks pupils became bored with the Fitbit,” the researchers write. “This evidence suggests that though the Fitbit serves to promote physical activity, for the pupils in this study, the Fitbit may have only produced modest and short-term effects.”\nFitbit’s non-personalized 10,000 steps per day target, for example, was cited as an unfair and pressurizing goal by study participants — generating feelings of guilt or lack of ability among users, which in turn acted as a disincentive for taking more exercise.\nStudy participants also reported feeling like they had less choice over how to engage in physical activity — which also ended up being a demotivating factor.\nWhile pressure from competition with peers, encouraged via in-app comparison in a social leaderboard scenario, also ultimately negatively impacted participants’ motivation to exercise.\n“Data from this study demonstrated that though clear potential exists, healthy lifestyle technologies negatively impact young people’s motivation for physical activity,” the researchers write. “Competition, peer comparison and social comparison to normative predetermined targets result in only short-term motivational effects.”\nIn their paper they reference a framework of motivational behavior in youth physical activity, called self-determination theory, which proposes that individuals are optimally motivated if they are making changes fully of their own volition, and therefore internalizing the rational for doing so and satisfying core psychological needs; vs responding to feelings of “controlled motivation” — be it to avoid feelings of guilt or obtain social approval, or else gain a reward or avoid a punishment.\nAnd while the researchers note that Fitbit’s wearable does include features that could, at least in theory, help support youngsters’ “basic psychological needs” to be self-motivated to exercise — citing features such as elements within the app that allow goal setting, give feedback on performance, and messaging features, for example — in practice the study found that Fitbit’s non-personalized goals ended up imposing overly exacting standards of social comparison on participants.\nAnd that pressure over peer-group competition and standardized goals squeezed out any potential for the Fitbit to support more sustained motivation for individual youngsters.\n“Our data suggests that peer-comparison was a key factor in undermining levels of competence and autonomous motivation. There wasn’t a desire for our participants to be more active for themselves and their own goals, or for fun, it was simply because they wanted to beat their mates,” said study author, Dr Charlotte Kerner, in a statement.\n“Self-determined forms of motivation are much better in encouraging people to engage in a particular behaviour,” she added.\nDespite the negative findings, the researchers suggest digital technologies could still play a useful role in encouraging exercise among young people — if they are coupled with support and guidance to help “educate young people in personalisation and interpreting data for individual goals and ability, rather than encouraging young people to compare themselves to others or a normative standard of achievement”.\nThey also emphasize the importance of autonomy in motivating young people to be more physically active.\n“Young people need to see themselves as capable and confident, and the ‘origin’ of their behaviours rather than a ‘pawn’,” they add.\nThe study, entitled The Motivational Impact of Wearable Healthy Lifestyle Technologies: A Self-determination Perspective on Fitbits With Adolescents, is published in the American Journal of Health Education.\nWe reached out to Fitbit for comment on the study — we’ll update this story with any response. Update: The company declined to provide a statement but a spokeswoman suggested that as the study did not assess actual physical activity levels it’s not possible to draw conclusions about actual impact on physical activity.\nShe further noted that Fitbit users can customize all their health and fitness goals, including the 10,000 steps goal — although the wider point there is that having a default goal creates an expectation and risks setting up a de facto standard across a social group, regardless of whether individuals can customize their own goals.", "tags": "tracker,wearable-technology,activity-tracker,wearable-devices", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/fitbit-turns-teens-off-exercising-study-finds/", "id": "1522458"}, {"title": "More political headbanging on encryption threatens privacy", "text": "The UK’s Home Secretary has yet again cranked up the pressure on messaging giants over use of end-to-end encryption to secure communications sent via popular services like WhatsApp — implying she would prefer tech companies voluntarily re-engineer their security systems so that decrypted data can be handed over to terror-fighting intelligence agencies on demand.\nWriting in a paywalled opinion article, published in the Telegraph yesterday, Rudd wheels out the now familiar political refrain that use of e2e encryption is hampering intelligence and law enforcement agencies, before going on to apply such twisted logic it’s hard not to conclude she’s deploying some kind of proprietary crypto of her own, i.e. which scrambles words into incomprehensible nonsense — enabling her to claim to support and value “strong encryption” whilst simultaneously calling for tech giants to work with her to undermine encrypted communications.\n“To be very clear — the government supports strong encryption and has no intention of banning end-to-end encryption. But the inability to gain access to encrypted data in specific and targeted instances — even with a warrant signed by a Secretary of State and a senior judge — is right now severely limiting our agencies’ ability to stop terrorist attacks and bring criminals to justice,” she writes, before going on to suggest that:\n1) “real people” (whoever they are) aren’t interested in ensuring the privacy of their communications;\n2) e2e encryption can be compromised without the need for a backdoor;\nQuoth Rudd:\nIt really is not clear what “reality” Rudd occupies when she writes that e2e encryption is only e2e encryption in “theory”. Unless she intends to imply that a security system could, in fact, contain a backdoor which enables access to decrypted data — in which case it would not be e2e encryption (yet she also specifically claims she’s not asking companies to “break encryption” or “create so called “”back doors”” so there’s plenty to scratch your head about here).\nAsked for thoughts on Rudd’s comments on encryption, WhatsApp parent Facebook declined to comment. And, frankly, who can blame it? When a message is so knotted with bizarre claims, contradictions and logical fallacies the only sensible response is to stay silent.\nOn the one hand Rudd is saying that billions of people use WhatsApp because it’s “incredibly user-friendly”, while at the same time claiming that robust security is too difficult for “real people” to use. (Historically she may have had a point — yet, today, billions of “real” WhatsApp users are sending billions of e2e encrypted messages, each and every day, and apparently not finding this task overly arduous.)\n“It appears that the Home Secretary’s greatest fear is software that is both secure AND usable. How sad,” said security research Alec Muffett, a former Facebook employee who worked on deploying e2e crypto for its ‘Secret Conversations’ feature, when asked for his thoughts on Rudd’s comments.\nIf you aim for a really cynical interpretation, you could say that Rudd is only saying she’s not asking companies to stop using e2e encryption; i.e. she’s implying they voluntarily don’t need to use e2e because “real people” aren’t bothered about the privacy of their comms anyway — ergo, tech giants are free to ditch those pesky e2e crypto systems that so annoy governments without suffering any backlash from users (and — crucially from her PoV — without the government being accused of literally “banning” encryption).\nThe phrase “trade-offs between security and “usability”” is an interesting one for her to choose, though. It brings to mind a specific security controversy pertaining to WhatsApp’s platform earlier this year, after The Guardian reported claims by a security researcher that he’d identified a “backdoor” in WhatsApp’s crypto — a claim WhatsApp vigorously denied. (The claim was also junked by a very long list of security researchers, and The Guardian went on to amend its story to remove the word “backdoor” — before ultimately publishing a review of the original, in its words, “flawed reporting”.)\nThe “retransmission vulnerability” the Guardian’s report had couched as a “backdoor” was in fact a “design decision”, said WhatsApp, which explained that it prioritizes message reliability for its very large user-base, meaning it will still deliver a message when a key has changed — offering the option for users to turn on a specific security notification to alert them to a potential risk of their communications having been compromised.\n“The design decision referenced in The Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks,” it said in a statement at the time.\nHow WhatsApp handles key retransmission was described as “a small and unlikely threat”, by academic Zeynep Tufekci, who organized an open letter denouncing the Guardian’s original report. The letter, addressed to the newspaper, asserted: “The behavior you highlight is a measured tradeoff that poses a remote threat in return for real benefits that help keep users secure.”\nIt’s possible that Rudd, and/or the intelligence and law enforcement agencies she liaises with, has picked up on these sorts of ‘usability vs security’ trade-off discussions, and is viewing design decisions that prioritize things like reliability ahead of “perfect, unbreakable security”, as she puts it, as offering a potential route for enacting some kind of targeted and limited interception, i.e. even when a platform has otherwise deployed strong encryption.\nAlbeit, Rudd is also saying the “options” she spies to “get more information on what serious criminals and terrorists are doing online” nonetheless rely on “mature conversations between the tech companies and the government” — hence repeating her call for both sides to “work together”.\nConfidentiality ensures there will be no public discussion about what exactly tech giants and governments might be agreeing to do, collectively and individually, to harvest the online activity of particular targets — although the risk for messaging platforms that sell services as strongly encrypted (and therefore give users an expectation of robust privacy), is every time these companies are seen to meet with government representatives their users might feel moved to wonder about the substance of their behind-closed-doors discussions. Which risks undermining user trust in their claims.\nAsked for thoughts on what “options” Rudd might be trying to articulate here, Eerke Boiten, a cyber security professor at De Montfort University, told TechCrunch: “With “usabililty vs security trade-offs” she has once again picked up a meaningful phrase and applied it out of context. WhatsApp end-to-end encryption is a usability success story, as its users barely notice it while gaining some level of security. Some level only — as Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook pointed out to UK government recently, by saying that WhatsApp communications metadata (who talks to whom, and when) can still be shared, and is likely still extremely useful for law enforcement.”\n“[Rudd] is publicly putting pressure on [Internet giants], possibly encouraged by how China managed to get Apple to stop offering VPN apps. Getting them to comply via legal means would be slow and invisible to the public eye, so this works much better,” he added.\nMeanwhile, Rudd has another agenda that is at least far more explicit: Getting tech giants to speed up takedowns of terrorist propaganda that’s being publicly spread via their platforms.\nAnd you could argue that applying political pressure over use of encryption is a way to grease the pipe of compliance for the related ‘online extremism’ takedowns issue.\nThe Home Secretary, who has been suggested as a potential successor to the current (embattled) UK Prime Minister, is certainly taking full advantage of the PR opportunities to raise her own profile as she tours tech giants’ HQs in Silicon Valley this week.\nHere’s Rudd standing in front of a giant Google logo at the company’s Mountain View HQ — where she went to discuss “what can be done to reduce the availability of online terrorist content”…\nAnd here she is getting a selfie with Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg who she was meeting to “discuss threat from terrorist use of the Internet”…\nAnd here’s a photo of the Home Secretary in talks with a couple of unidentified Twitter staffers to hear “progress made to tackle terrorist content online and discuss further action needed”. (Presumably Jack was too busy for a photo call.)\nRudd has also vlogged about her intent to get tech companies to “take action together” to stop terrorists spreading extremist propaganda online.\nThis Home Office PR blitz is notable in not making explicit mention of e2e encryption. Rudd has apparently left that political push to the pages of a lesser read UK newspaper. Which feeds the idea she’s playing a few propaganda games of her own here.\nWhile the bundling of the two political concerns (private terrorist/criminal comms; and public online extremism content) allows the government to obfuscate outcomes, spread blame and spin failures.\nOn the flip side, tech giants have been spinning up their own PR machines ahead of today’s debut workshop of the newly formed Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).\nThe initiative was announced in late June by Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft to — as they put it — “help us continue to make our hosted consumer services hostile to terrorists and violent extremists”, specifically by sharing information and best practices with each other, government and NGOs. Other tech companies have since signed up.\nGIFCT is of course a way for tech firms to share the burden — and if you want to be cynical, spread the blame — of responding to growing political pressure over online extremism which affects them all, albeit to greater and lesser degrees.\nFacebook, Google and Twitter have all published the same blog post about the first meeting of the forum, in which they describe their joint “mission”, set out “strategies” and list a few near-term aims.\ntl;dr no one can accuse Silicon Valley of doing nothing about online extremism now.\nThey write:\nAlso today, Google has a separate update on measures it’s applying on YouTube to “fight against online terrorism” — having faced a backlash from advertisers earlier this year the company arguably has even more reason to be seen to be taking action, and for those actions to be effective at stemming the loss of ad dollars.", "tags": "computer-security,end-to-end-encryption,cryptography,social-media", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/more-political-headbanging-on-encryption-threatens-privacy/", "id": "1521823"}, {"title": "Plume Labs launches Plume.io, an API for air pollution", "text": "Plume Labs has been working on air pollution for a while. In addition to its mobile app and air quality device, the startup is launching a paid API called Plume.io so that anybody can add air quality to their own service. Think about it as Dark Sky’s API, but for air quality.\nPlume Labs has designed its own algorithm to predict air pollution around the world. The company relies on 12,000 environmental monitoring stations in 60 countries. Many agencies and local authorities share air quality data.\nThe company then combines this data with other factors, such as the time of the day, weather conditions, weather forecasts, geographical specifics and human activities. Plume Labs can always compare its predictions with actual pollution levels by waiting and pulling data later in the day.\nAnd it turns out that many companies would like to use this sort of forecast for air quality. That’s why the company is opening up its API to third-party companies. You can get data for Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3) starting at $500 a month.\nMany companies are interested in Plume.io, such as companies working on smart homes and smart cities, real estate companies, fitness companies, healthcare companies as well as cosmetics makers. And Plume Labs will also give free access to Plume.io to researchers, activists, etc.\n“We believe that environmental health is deeply personal and an important emerging vertical for personal health and wellbeing, so our Air Report mobile app and our consumer air quality tracker will remain our core focus,” co-founder and CEO Romain Lacombe told me. “However more and more companies were reaching out to access our air quality forecasts, and opening the Plume API will give these corporate clients access to our advanced predictive platform. Working with API partners will also bring financial support to keep our core app free for consumers, and dramatically broaden our reach to raise awareness of the public health crisis of pollution.”\nSo if you’ve been using Plume Labs’ mobile app, it’s not going away any time soon. And you’ll also soon be able to pre-order a Flow, Plume Labs’ own device. Plume.io is just a new service for developers who need air quality data. In the future, Plume Labs would like to extend forecasting data beyond 24 hours and add other data points, such as pollen level.", "tags": "france-newsletter,plume-labs", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/plume-labs-launches-plume-io-an-api-for-air-pollution/", "id": "1521886"}, {"title": "Carspring, a London and Berlin startup that lets you buy a used car online, raises £5M Series B", "text": "Carspring, the London and Berlin used car buying platform founded by Rocket Internet, has picked up £5 million in Series B funding. Backing the round are Rocket Internet itself, along with Channel 4’s Commercial Growth Fund, which offers media in the form of TV advertising in return for equity. In other words, a portion of this round (£1.3m) isn’t cash per se. A number of other unnamed investors also participated.\nLaunched in 2015, Carspring is described as an online used car dealership and moves the buying process for a used car entirely online. On the supply side it sources used cars from a network of used car dealers, while the demand side sees it put in place numerous features to make buying online both trustworthy and extra convenient.\nThis includes mechanical checks to ensure vehicles makes the Carspring grade, a 6 month warranty on cars bought, home delivery, and a 14 day money-back guarantee — although I’m pretty sure the latter falls within distance selling regulation anyway. Either way, a big part of the startup’s pitch to consumers is that its processes can be trusted, with no or little downside buying a car online rather than in person. In addition, the company provides financing to let you buy your car through instalments.\nThe importance of putting weight behind the Carspring brand would also explain why the company is investing heavily in ‘above the line’ advertising and taking media-for-equity investment from Channel 4. While VCs are fine with significant dollars being spent on online marketing, which is highly targeted and trackable in terms of ROI, they aren’t always so keen on lots of their cash being sloshed on TV ads. Channel 4’s Commercial Growth Fund offers an alternative way for the right kinds of startups at the right stage to invest in and potentially benefit from television since only equity swaps hands.\nTo that end, in respect of Carspring, Vinay Solanki, Head of Channel 4’s Growth Fund, says he looks for “highly disruptive early stage companies” that are solving consumer problems but are not typically able to access TV advertising in their growth stage without help. We can also expect to see Carspring’s first TV ad campaign air in the not so distant future.", "tags": "carspring", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/carspring-2/", "id": "1521427"}, {"title": "Klarna launches a peer-to-peer payment app called Wavy", "text": "Fintech startup Klarna grew thanks to its e-commerce payment service, but now the startup is diversifying a bit. The Swedish company is launching Wavy, a free peer-to-peer payment app and service.\nAfter Cookies imploded, Klarna approached the team behind the German app so that they could join another fintech company. It turns out that this team has been working on another peer-to-peer payment app. And the fact that Klarna is backing this project makes it interesting as it’s a highly competitive space.\nThere are quite a few peer-to-peer payment apps out there, such as Venmo and Square Cash in the U.S., Lydia in France and Ireland, Circle, etc. Other fintech products also let you send money instantly for free, such as Revolut and N26. Finally, big players are also adding peer-to-peer payment features as part of their existing products, such as Apple with Apple Pay in iOS 11, or Facebook with Messenger in the U.S.\nWavy is trying a different approach because people are tired of downloading new apps, signing up and saving their credit card information everywhere — with Wavy, only one side of the transaction has to sign up. It works in 31 European countries already.\nWhen you create a transaction using the app, Wavy generates a link. You can then share this link in any messaging app. It works in Whatsapp, Messenger, iMessage — anything you want. Your recipient can then click on this link to open a web page.\nYour recipient can then accept and redeem the payment with a standard IBAN — no need to sign up. If you are requesting money, your recipient can put their credit card or debit card number. Once again, you don’t need an account. If your friend doesn’t click on the link, the transaction expires after a while. You can add animated stickers to your payment.\nWavy hopes that at least some people will download the app — you need an account to initiate a transaction after all. If people on your network sign up, you can tap on their names directly in the app without having to share a link in a messaging app. That’s how Wavy can create a viral loop.\nBut Wavy’s hidden weapon is that anyone with a Klarna account can activate Wavy in their settings.

And that is leading some of them to make acquisitions.\nRCI, a division of Wyndham Worldwide, has acquired Love Home Swap, a startup out of London that lets people book time to stay in other people’s homes, while at the same time list their properties for people to book.\nWyndham is not revealing the terms of the deal, but we have learned from sources close to the deal that it is £40 million (just under $53 million) in cash. The company had raised about £12 million ($16 million) in funding.\nNotably, as part of the deal, co-founder and CEO Debbie Wosskow is stepping down from her role leading the company and moving to an advisory position for the next six months. Her brother Ben, who co-founded the company with her, will step up as CEO.\nWosskow has been one of the more outspoken executives in the London tech community when it comes to advocating for a more diverse landscape of founders, and last year she and Anna Jones, the CEO of Hearst UK, formed AllBright a funding and education network geared to female entrepreneurs. Stepping away from the CEO role will give her more time to focus on that.\nThe deal is not the first time a large hotel chain has acquired a travel startup to move into the new wave of marketplaces. Last year, Accor Hotels paid $170 million to acquire OneFineStay, a would-be Airbnb competitor that focuses exclusively on high-end properties.\nMeanwhile, Expedia was reportedly rebuffed in its attempt to acquire Luxury Retreats (another company focused on high-end properties that eventually was snapped up by Airbnb). In the meantime, it and Priceline have been pumping up their inventory of vacation rentals in an attempt to compete with Airbnb.\nLove Home Swap is a logical acquisition for Wyndham’s RCI group. The larger company is famous for hotel chains like Travelodge and Ramada, but also has long had a business in self-catered and family accommodation. RCI is mainly focused on time-share exchanges (swapping one timeshare interval for another), and Wyndham has been in the business of private home rentals since 2001, with 120,000 properties. But RCI had not really moved into the complementary area of private home swaps, which is what Love Home Swap will give them.\n“Since first pioneering the vacation exchange concept more than 40 years ago, RCI has continually found new ways to evolve and grow its own business while also propelling the exchange industry further,” said Gordon Gurnik, president of RCI. “Through this acquisition we expand the exchange options we offer travelers and strengthen our footprint in key growth markets across the globe.”\nThe Love Home Swap deal is a far cry from the numbers that float around Airbnb, which is reportedly heading for an IPO, and has raised more than $1 billion and is now valued at $31 billion.\nNevertheless, it underscores a large swing in the hotel industry for the bigger and more established companies — be they large hotel chains or the megaliths that control the vast amount of hotel bookings online. They are all buying up and investing in some of the smaller upstarts to help position themselves for the next stage of competition.\nAirbnb feels unstoppable now, and its moves into areas like flight booking, vacation planning and other services adjacent to accommodation are gradually making it more likely that it will soon be able to close (and control) the travel loop completely. In that regard, Wyndham’s move feels less a threat, as it is a sign of how the big owner of Ramada, Super 8, Travelodge, Howard Johnson, Wyndham Hotels and more is coming along for the ride.\nUpdated to note that RCI is part of Wyndham Worldwide, not Wyndham Hotel Group; and that RCI’s business is primarily focused on time share swaps, not time shares.", "tags": "travel,hotels,love-home-swap", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/wyndham-hotel-group-buys-love-home-swap-for-53m/", "id": "1521505"}, {"title": "Lost My Name, the tech-driven kids book publisher, raises $8.5M and partners with Roald Dahl Estate", "text": "Lost My Name, the London-based startup that uses tech to create and publish personalised story books for children, has raised $8.5 million in Series B funding. It is also revealing an upcoming tie-in with the Roald Dahl Estate, owners of IP such as Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory.\nThe round was led by Ravensburger, a leading European publisher of games, puzzles, and children’s books, so it’s a strategic investment of sorts. Existing investors, Google Ventures, Project A Ventures, Greycroft, The Chernin Group, and Allen & Co, also participated. I understand part of the round is a venture debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank, too.\nIn related news, Lost My Name’s name is lost no more. The startup (not so) quietly re-branded last week as “Wonderbly,” a move that is likely part of a bid to move beyond the company’s original title and only ‘hit’ so far, the wonderful “The Little Boy/Girl Who Lost His/Her Name,” which has sold over 2.7 million copies and claims to be the leading picture book in the markets Wonderbly operates.\nCo-founder and CEO Asi Sharabi told me during a catch up call last week that the company has created six new products this year, with more to come.

The company shared a note from Apple (below) explaining that its app was removed because “it includes content that is illegal in China.”\nThe app continues to be available for users across the world outside of China, the company said. However, the process to create an App Store account in a different country is unknown to many users, so it is unlikely to fill the void of the missing Chinese app.\nAnother provide, Star VPN, tweeted that its app had also been removed.\nApple had not replied for comment at the time of writing. In a statement issued later it said it was “required” to remove the apps because they violate Chinese law.\n\nThe App Store purge is hugely impactful because VPNs represent the only way that a China-based individual can bypass state censorship controls to access the internet without restrictions. The Chinese government effectively illegalized VPNs when new rules issued in January required them to receive government approval in order to operate. That appears to be why Apple was forced to remove ExpressVPN and others like it.\nApple may believe it is best for its business to co-operate with requests from Beijing, but this App Store purge just created one of the biggest setbacks for the free internet in China’s history.\n“We’re disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China’s censorship efforts. ExpressVPN strongly condemns these measures, which threaten free speech and civil liberties,” ExpressVPN wrote on its blog.\nToday’s news is the latest in a series of developments against the free internet from China.\nTwo popular VPN services were forced offline in China earlier this month leaving their users, which included professionals who require access to the global internet for work, without an alternative. Government officials denied a story from Bloomberg that the country’s mobile operators had been told to ban VPN apps by early 2018, but other steps have clearly been taken. Reuters reported earlier this month that the Great Firewall, the term for China’s internet censorship apparatus, had been “upgraded” with new capabilities. VPN services subsequently found that they had been hit by the most sophisticated attacks from China to date. High-end hotels have even ceased offer VPNs to guests.\nThose new capability apparently also made it possible for the government to interfere with messaging apps. While now blocked entirely, WhatsApp users found that they were unable to send videos and photos through the chat app and issues seemed to extend to WeChat, China’s most popular messaging service. The censorship seemed to be linked to the response to the death of dissident Liu Xiaobo, a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, who lost a battle to liver cancer earlier this month having been denied permission to leave custody to seek medical treatment overseas.\nGoing direct to Apple is becoming an effective way to enforce censorship since the U.S. firm controls what apps are available in China. The tactic proved successful for China earlier this year when Apple removed the New York Times app from the local Chinese App Store. The Times and Wall Street Journal are among a number of international news sites blocked in China, according to censorship monitoring service Great Fire.\nIt’s unclear whether similar action has been taken with Android stores in China. The Google Play Store is not present in China, where a handful of third-party app stores are the most influential distributors of Android apps.\nNot-for-profit group GreatFire offers ‘censorship-proof’ alternatives like its Android VPN FreeBrowser and other services that include a collaboration with The New York Times, but Apple’s iOS doesn’t permit similar options.\nApple just announced Isabel Ge Mahe as the first managing director for its Chinese business and, beyond battling a sales slump in China, the long-time Apple executive is tasked with the difficult job of managing a relationship with Beijing. The U.S. firm recently announced plans to develop its first China-based data center, a move that is thought to be related to the country’s new cybersecurity laws which went into effect June 1.", "tags": "technology,computing,apple-inc,internet-censorship", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/29/apple-removes-vpn-apps-from-the-app-store-in-china/", "id": "1521006"}, {"title": "Expedia invests $350M in Traveloka to create Southeast Asia’s newest unicorn", "text": "Expedia is deepening its focus on Southeast Asia after it invested $350 million in Traveloka, an online travel portal based out of Indonesia.\nA source close to the deal confirmed that the investment values Traveloka at more than $1 billion.

It said that this money, which is only for use via its China business, would be used to expand its presence in those three cities and move into more parts of China “on an accelerated timeframe.” The company estimates that it will have 15,000 members in China by the end of this year.\n“We are extremely pleased to deepen our partnerships with Hony Capital and SoftBank to bring WeWork to more locations and cities across China at an even faster pace. Since coming to China only a year ago, we’ve been able to establish a vibrant community of creators and companies — and we’ve only just begun,” WeWork CEO Adam Neumann said in a statement.\nThe company has picked two close allies to help it build its business in China, in the face of emerging local competitors that include Naked Hub, a company that started out in resorts but is raising $200 million to expand across Asia, and URWork.\nBeijing-based private equity firm Hony Capital first invested in WeWork last year. Its other deals in China have include bike-sharing firm Ofo, while it has also done investments in the U.S. and Israel. SoftBank, meanwhile, has been linked with WeWork for some time. It January, it emerged that the Japanese firm was in talks to invest as much as $4 billion into WeWork, having previously missed the chance to participate in two past funding rounds, according to a source.\nWeWork said it operates 155 physical locations in 50 cities across 15 countries worldwide. Elsewhere in Asia, it has revealed plans to move into Japan — where it is working with SoftBank — and India, while it has been linked with a move into Southeast Asia via a Singapore-based space.

Lazada itself offers a Prime-like subscription service in partnership with Uber and Netflix, as well as grocery deliveries via Redmart, a service it acquired last year. Unlike Amazon, though, Redmart takes a minimum of one-day to fulfill orders. On top of that competitive advantage, Amazon is offering deep discounts for early users, although some customers complained that the coupon codes they used did not work.\n“This is the first time we’re offering Prime Now to an entire country.

A Grab representative confirmed that SoftBank’s Vision fund is not part of the current commitment, it is coming from SoftBank Group Corp.\nA source confirmed that this new money gives Grab a post-money valuation of more than $6 billion.

We’re encouraged that these two visionary companies share our optimism for the future of Southeast Asia and its on-demand transportation and payments markets, and recognize that Grab is ideally positioned to capitalize on the massive market opportunities,” said Anthony Tan, group CEO and co-founder of Grab.\nEssentially, both Didi and SoftBank are doubling down on the belief that Grab has what it takes to defeat Uber in Southeast Asia, the same way that Didi did in China when Uber agreed to sell its local business last August. That hope of defeating the U.S. firm was reignited this month when Uber agreed to sell its business in Russia to local rival Yandex.\n“Starting with transport, Grab is establishing a clear leadership in Southeast Asia’s internet economy based on its market position, superior technology, and truly local insight,” Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, added via a statement that is fairly damning of Uber. (Didi is an investor in Uber by virtue of the China acquisition deal.)\nGrab operates in 36 cities across seven countries in Southeast Asia, where it claims over 50 million downloads from users and 1.1 million drivers on its platform. Its services are primarily focused on licensed taxis and private cars, but Grab also offers motorbike taxis, shuttle bus services and carpooling in a selection of countries.\nUber doesn’t reveal public data for its Southeast Asia-based business. But one rival that is upsetting Grab is Go-Jek, a bike and car on-demand platform in Indonesia that is seen widely as the market leader in the country.\nOn a business-level, Uber began to see profitability in selected markets in Southeast Asia last summer, sources told us at the time, but it increased its investment in the market (and India) following its exit from China, which then-CEO Travis Kalanick revealed was costing the firm $1 billion a year. A Grab spokesperson said the company is profitable “in certain verticals and cities, but we don’t break that down.” Grab did share the results of a study it commissioned which found it owns 95 percent marketshare of licensed taxi e-hailing and 71 percent of private cars across Southeast Asia.\nIn a bid to take its business to the next level, Grab is also developing a mobile payments platform. That began as a mechanism to accept payment via credit cards, having started out as cash-only, but that focus has also seen Grab develop a fintech push in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and the world’s fourth most populous country.\nIndonesia is tipped to account for more than half of the revenue of ride-sharing services across the region by 2025, with the overall industry forecast to $13.1 billion that year up from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to a report co-authored by Google last year. Grab sees a lot of that potential stuck behind the country’s outdated banking system, and it is working on financial inclusion systems to help grow the consumer pie that it serves.\nAt the start of 2017, Grab announced a $700 million investment program to build its services in Indonesia, of which at least $100 million is dedicated to investments and acquisitions. It didn’t take long to dip into that, with Grab buying offline payment startup Kudo two months later in a deal sources told TechCrunch could be worth as much as $100 million over time.\nThe fintech play is a move to battle Go-Jek, which began offering payment services before Grab dipped its toes into the market.

Selfie app company Meitu held the largest listing from a tech company for nearly a decade in December — raising more than $500 million with its floating — while in recent weeks PC gaming brand Razer and Tencent-controlled e-books service China Publishing have both announced their intention to list in the city-state.\nHong Kong was widely thought to have blown its chance to put itself on the global map when Alibaba opted for a New York listing in 2014 because the HKSE was unable to accommodate its company structure. But, nearly three years on, the tide appears to be turning for some.\nSpeaking on stage at our TechCrunch China event in Shenzhen last month, a senior executive for logistics on-demand company Lalamove said his firm is eying a public listing in Hong Kong before 2020. Blake Larson, head of international for the company — which raised a $30 million Series B in January — said a dual-listing in the U.S. is possible, but the HKSE is the priority to “show it is possible to build a global technology company from Hong Kong.”\nThere’s plenty of interest beyond local companies, too, it seems. At the Rise event in Hong Kong this month, TechCrunch spoke to two founders who anonymously revealed that their Asia-based companies, each of which has raised more than $100 million in investment and does business worldwide, are devoting significant time towards a potential HKSE IPO in the future.\nAnt Financial, the Alibaba affiliated fintech firm, has also been linked with a Hong Kong IPO. The firm raised over $3 billion at a valuation of up to $60 billion at the beginning of the year — that cash injection is reported to have pushed its much-anticipated IPO plan back to at least 2018 at the earliest.\nHong Kong may have landed a collection of reputable companies in Meitu, Razer and China Publishing, but it still has some way to go before it becomes a viable option for all.\nFor one thing, this trio all have notable businesses and brands in China, which is really a requisite factor. But there are further complications. Regulations make it difficult for companies that are still scaling their business to go public in Hong Kong since the exchange has stringent financial requirements.\n“I definitely think the HKSE can be a destination for tech IPOs, but the Hong Kong government, administration and its investors all need to change their rules and ways to analyze growth potential of unprofitable internet companies,” Hans Tung, a partner with U.S.-China VC firm GGV, told TechCrunch.\nThose thoughts were echoed by Kee Lock Chua, group president and CEO of Vertex Holdings, a firm affiliated with Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek.\n“The Hong Kong Exchange is a viable listing venue for technology companies because of its liquidity and valuation,”Chua said in an email. “[But] the Hong Kong market generally still prefers profitable companies.”\n“Technology companies that are growing rapidly but not profitable in the short term may find the U.S. market to be more suitable,” he added.\nAnother issue is that share structure factor. Hong Kong somewhat famously does not allow dual classes of common equity in its companies. That was the main facto that saw Alibaba head West for its IPO, which was a record U.S. listing and a major loss for Hong Kong.\n“Alibaba should have been able to IPO in Hong Kong, the HKSE should have allowed Alibaba’s partnership structure to exist. Google and many tech companies have super voting structures on the Nasdaq. An Alibaba IPO in Hong Kong would have been a game changer,” Tung explained.\nThat said, there are young companies that have made it despite the requirements.\n“Our portfolio company IGG [a mobile games developer] was listed on the GEM board [for growth companies] initially and was subsequently promoted to the Hong Kong main board. Today, it is trading at $2.5 billion in market cap,” Vertex’s Chua said.\nThe political uncertainty in the U.S. right now coupled with the development of unicorn startups across Asia gives Hong Kong a viable shot at becoming a credible IPO option. But the U.S. still retains cachet for tech companies in Asia and that’s reflect in those that are most likely to list next.\nTech firms like Singapore-based games firm Sea (formerly known as Garena), Vietnam’s gaming and messaging company VNG, and e-commerce company Reboonz (backed by both Vertex and GGV) are all reported to be exploring opportunities having grown beyond the venture capital ecosystem. However, in each case, media reports are linking them to U.S.-based IPOs.\nYet, there are no happy stories of Asian companies — excluding those from China — listing in America in recent times.\nMOL Global is probably the most notable case. The Malaysian payment firm traded on the Nasdaq for a fairly turbulent 18-month period. Things got off to a bad start when the share price dipped 30 percent on its debut in October 2014, and, following a series of crises, the firm announced its delisting in April 2016. Ironically, MOL is involved in Razer’s IPO following an investment deal.\nSea is likely to be the first of the new Asian contenders to test the waters in the U.S. — Japanese chat app Line opted for a dual Tokyo-U.S. listing to mitigate risk last year — and how it performs, if and when it goes public, could be a deciding factor for others considering a similar route.

The full amount of funding has not been disclosed, but we understand from a source very close to the deal that it is $250 million.\nThe sizeable funding underscores ongoing momentum in the transportation industry to build more tech-based solutions, updating outmoded legacy infrastructure with more efficient services that can meet the new demand for on-demand.

Before this round, Via had raised $137 million with investors including 83North, C4 Ventures, Ervington Investments, Expansion Venture Capital, Hearst Ventures, Kapor Capital, Lior Prosor, Pitango, Planven, Poalim and RiverPark. Pitango had led Via’s previous two rounds, a $100 million Series C and a $27 million Series B.\nThe valuation is also not being disclosed, but a source tells us that it is a ‘definite upround.’ According to market analytics firm Zirra, the pre-money valuation for Via was between $450 million and $500 million. Based on that, at a rough estimate, that would put the valuation for Via now at $750 million.\nShoval said that the investment will see Via expanding its own-branded operations in Europe, initially in London, with Paris soon to follow. Via is also going to come to more markets in the U.S.: today, it’s live in New York, Chicago, and Washington DC and says it’s providing over 1 million rides per month, but it has also run smaller programs in Austin, TX and Orange County, CA, so those regions could be two likely targets for further expansion.\nWhat’s interesting about Via is that while it is building its direct to consumer, own-brand operations, it also has been inking licensing deals with third parties that are already established in various places. These include partnerships with Arriva and Keolis, two mass-transit companies that operate city buses, train services and more in multiple counties. (Arriva is part of Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and Keolis’ parent is SNCF of France.)\nArriva and Keolis are licensing Via’s operating system to build their own carpooling trials. “This is an example how we use our tech to let companies transition to dynamic, real time solutions,” said Shoval. “It’s much more efficient to offer dynamic solutions using smaller vehicles instead of large busses.” He added that there is also potential to use Via’s platform to help direct traffic for other vehicles they operate.\nShoval said that the Daimler deal getting announced today will encompass investments and partnerships to expand these two existing business lines, and more.\nVia has been in partnership with Daimler for years already, including working on the pilot in Orange County using Mercedez Benz vehicles. \nThis Via investment presents a number of opportunities to Daimler. One is that it gives Daimler a bigger sales funnel in providing vehicles for such services. In particular, a Via partnership can help in their own R&D and design work for new vehicles optimised for carpooling and other on-demand transportation. “One big question [for the future of transportation] is, ‘what is the right vehicle?'” Shoval said. “There are the seating arrangements, how you connect the sensors, what kind of door it should have. This is a big piece of mobility.”\nIt will also give Daimler an opportunity to embed technology and sensors in those vehicles that can make other ridesharing services more efficient. “We also believe that the vehicles in the network, at the end of the day, it’s not just an app but a whole service that you are getting. It makes sense to have these things converge,” said Shoval. \nLastly, it gives Daimler a chance to get behind the wheel (so to speak) of the transportation service itself, thus developing a business around recurring service revenues.\nDaimler is no stranger to the ridesharing business, or indeed in investing around transportation. Similar to other automakers like Volkswagen and GM, the company has made a number of investments and acquisitions in the last several years around transportation technology and also transportation services themselves. They include an owning stake in Here, the mapping business; investments in Careem and car-tech services like Momenta; and the acquisition of myTaxi and the many operations that now form a part of that like Hailo and TaxiBeat.\n“On-demand ride-sharing offers many new ways of making city traffic efficient, needs-based and sustainable – especially when it involves the use of spacious, safe and comfortable vans,” says Volker Mornhinweg, Head of Mercedes-Benz Vans, in a statement. “Via is one of the most successful providers in the growing ride-sharing sector while Mercedes-Benz Vans has the perfect vehicles that are being continuously optimized for this job. By deepening our cooperation with Via, we are thus taking the next logical step in the context of our strategy for the future and are expanding our range of new mobility services.”", "tags": "transportation,carpooling,via,daimler", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/04/via-raises-250m-led-by-daimler-to-bring-its-carpooling-technology-to-europe/", "id": "1535669"}, {"title": "Habito, an app that helps you find the right mortgage, raises £18.5M Series B led by Atomico", "text": "Habito, a London startup that is bringing the entire mortgage process online, has raised £18.5 million in Series B funding. Atomico, the European VC firm founded by Skype’s Niklas Zennström, led the round, with participation from existing investors Ribbit Capital, Mosaic Ventures, and Revolutionary (Ad)Ventures. It brings the total raised by the U.K. company to just over £27 million.\nMore interestingly, Habito, which probably counts Trussle as its closest direct competitor, says the new capital will in part be used to integrate its technology with major retail banks and high street lenders to facilitate “real-time mortgage approvals”, in addition to marketing and other product development. The startup says it also plans to expand its offering to other parts of the mortgage process, namely home and life insurance.\nCalling itself a “digital mortgage broker,” Habito was founded by Daniel Hegarty, who was previously an early employee at Wonga, to remove a lot of the friction when applying for a mortgage. The company’s tech claims to analyse over 11,000 mortgage products across 70\nlenders in real-time, to help identify the most suitable mortgage based on your individual circumstances. The entire application process can then be completed via the Habito app/website for free, thus eliminating the fees that most traditional mortgage brokers charge.\nThere is, however, an additional aspect to the Habito premise, and one that has the potential to be quite disruptive beyond pricing. Once you’ve signed up to the app and entered all of the required details related to your eligibility and your current mortgage and property (if you have one), the startup will effectively become your broker going forward.\nThis sees its tech continually monitor the mortgage products available on the market and alert you if it thinks you have become mismatched and therefore are paying over the odds. The idea is to make switching also as frictionless as possible. That’s because, says Habito, 1 in 4 British homeowners are currently mismatched, paying lenders an average of around £4,000 more than they need to every year.\n“Fintech companies are tackling a lot of traditional areas that are ready for a new approach. This is one of them,” Atomico Partner Niall Wass tells TechCrunch. “Matching borrowers and lenders in the residential mortgage space is slow, expensive and very fragmented – with around 15,000 largely offline brokers in the U.K. But the potential is not just in the U.K., it’s across multiple markets with the same problem.”\nHowever, despite describing the Habito value proposition for both borrowers and lenders as being pretty clear, Wass says one challenge the startup faces is the degree of apathy by house owners when it comes to remortgaging.\n“This apathy is why there is such massive overspend in this market globally – perhaps because the process to move to a better mortgage has been so slow and complicated. So the first challenge is continuing to make the process simple, speedy, free and with a better outcome for the borrower. This is absolutely key,” he says.\n“I love the idea that Habito has your back and will check the market automatically for a better deal for you – but that kind of message has to get out, so the next challenge is to help build the brand”.\nIn addition, the Atomico VC says that Habito will need to further prove the benefits to lenders too by using more technology to make it easier and cheaper to “assess the customer risk and matching them to the most appropriate product”. Hence plans to integrate with major retail banks and high street lenders at the technology level.", "tags": "atomico,trussle", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/03/habito-atomico/", "id": "1535517"}, {"title": "Building health AIs should be UK ambition, says strategy review", "text": "A wide-ranging, UK government-commissioned industrial strategy review of the life sciences sector, conducted by Oxford University’s Sir John Bell, has underlined the value locked up in publicly funded data held by the country’s National Health Service — and called for a new regulatory framework to be established in order to “capture for the UK the value in algorithms generated using NHS data”.\nThe NHS is a free-at-the-point of use national health service covering some 65 million users — which gives you an idea of the unique depth and granularity of the patient data it holds.\nAnd how much potential value could therefore be created for the nation by utilizing patient data-sets to develop machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis and tracking.\n“AI is likely to be used widely in healthcare and it should be the ambition for the UK to develop and test integrated AI systems that provide real-time data better than human monitoring and prediction of a wide range of patient outcomes in conditions such as mental health, cancer and inflammatory disease,” writes Bell in the report.\nHis recommendation for the government and the NHS to be pro-active about creating and capturing AI-enabled value off of valuable, taxpayer-funded health data-sets comes hard on the heels of the conclusion of a lengthy investigation by the UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO, into a controversial 2015 data-sharing arrangement between Google-DeepMind and a London-based NHS Trust, the Royal Free Hospitals Trust, to co-develop a clinical task management app.\nIn July the ICO concluded that the arrangement — DeepMind’s first with an NHS Trust — breached UK privacy law, saying the ~1.6M NHS patients whose full medical records are being shared with the Google-owned company (without their consent) could not have “reasonably expected” their information to be used in this way.\nAnd while the initial application the pair have co-developed does not involve applying machine learning algorithms to NHS data, a wider memorandum of understanding between them sets out their intention to do just that within five years.\nMeanwhile, DeepMind has also inked additional data-sharing arrangements with other NHS Trusts that do already entail AI-based research — such as a July 2016 research partnership with Moorfields Eye Hospital that’s aiming to investigate whether machine learning algorithms can automate the analysis of digital eye scans to diagnose two eye conditions.\nIn that instance DeepMind is getting free access to one million “anonymized” eye scans to try to develop diagnosis AI models.\nThe company has committed to publishing the results of the research but any AI models it develops — trained off of the NHS data-set — are unlikely to be handed back freely to the public sector.\nRather, the company’s stated aim for its health-based AI ambitions is to create commercial IP, via multiple research partnerships with NHS organizations — positioning itself to sell trained AI models as a future software-based service to healthcare organizations at whatever price it deems appropriate.\nThis is exactly the sort of data-enabled algorithmic value that Bell is urging the UK government to be pro-active about capturing for the country — by establishing a regulatory framework that positions the NHS (and the UK’s citizens who fund it) to benefit from data-based AI insights generated off of its vast data holdings, instead of allowing large commercial entities to push in and asset strip these taxpayer-funded assets.\n“[E]xisting data access agreements in the UK for algorithm development have currently been completed at a local level with mainly large companies and may not share the rewards fairly, given the essential nature of NHS patient data to developing algorithms,” warns Bell.\n“There is an opportunity for defining a clear framework to better realise the true value for the NHS of the data at a national level, as currently agreements made locally may not share the benefit with other regions,” he adds.\nIn an interview with the Guardian newspaper he is asked directly for his views on DeepMind’s collaboration with the Royal Free NHS Trust — and describes it as the “canary in the coalmine”.\n“I heard that story and thought ‘Hang on a minute, who’s going to profit from that?’” he is quoted as saying. “What Google’s doing in [other sectors], we’ve got an equivalent unique position in the health space. Most of the value is the data. The worst thing we could do is give it away for free.”\n“What you don’t want is somebody rocking up and using NHS data as a learning set for the generation of algorithms and then moving the algorithm to San Francisco and selling it so all the profits come back to another jurisdiction,” Bell also told the newspaper.\nIn his report, Bell also highlights the unpreparedness of “current or planned” regulations to provide a framework to “account for machine learning algorithms that update with new data” — pointing out, for example, that: “Currently algorithms making medical claims are regulated as medical devices.”\nAnd again, in 2016 DeepMind suspended testing of the Streams app it had co-developed with the Royal Free NHS Trust after it emerged the pair had failed to register this software as a medical device with the MHRA prior to trialling it in the hospitals.\nBell suggests that a better approach for testing healthcare software and algorithms could involve sandboxed access and use of dummy data — rather than testing with live patient data, as DeepMind and the Royal Free were.\n“One approach to this may be in the development of ‘sandbox’ access to deidentified or synthetic data from providers such as NHS Digital, where innovators could safely develop algorithms and trial new regulatory approaches for all product types,” he writes.\nIn the report Bell also emphasizes the importance of transparency in winning public trust to further the progress of research which utilizes publicly funded health data-sets.\n“Many more people support than oppose health data being used by commercial organisations undertaking health research, but it is also clear that strong patient and clinician engagement and involvement, alongside clear permissions and controls, are vital to the success of any health data initiative,” he writes.\n“This should take place as part of a wider national conversation with the public enabling a true understanding of data usage in as much detail as they wish, including clear information on who can access data and for what purposes. This conversation should also provide full information on how health data is vital to improving health, care and services through research.”\nHe also calls for the UK’s health care system to “set out clear and consistent national approaches to data and interoperability standards and requirements for data access agreements” in order to help reduce response time across all data providers, writing: “Currently, arranging linkage and access to national-level datasets used for research can require multiple applications and access agreements with unclear timelines. This can cause delays to data access enabling both research and direct care.”\nOther NHS-related recommendations in the report include a call to end handwritten prescriptions and make eprescribing mandatory for hospitals; the creation of a forum for researchers across academia, charities and industry to engage with all national health data programs; and the creation of between two and five digital innovation hubs to provide data across regions of three to five million people with the aim of accelerating research access to meaningful national datasets.", "tags": "machine-learning,united-kingdom,national-health-service,health-care", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/building-health-ais-should-be-uk-ambition-says-strategy-review/", "id": "1534283"}, {"title": "Google takes steps to comply with EC antitrust order for Google Shopping", "text": "Google has submitted details to the European Commission of how it intends to amend its price comparison service, Google Shopping, to comply with an antitrust decision earlier this summer.

More recently Blue Apron has been feeling the pinch.\nThat’s before you consider the plethora of smaller startups that have sold up or shut down rather than grown on their own.\nIn that context, Baidu was a parent with deep pockets and a specific mission: the company has been very keen to grow out from its core search business into a number of adjacent areas that both could help the search business continue to grow, and also help Baidu diversify its own revenue base.\nIt’s a strategy also taken by other search giants: Google has its own shopping services that it has been trying to build out; Yandex in Russia has built out a number of businesses in areas like on-demand transport and more.\nBaidu’s retreat signals not just that it may be pulling away from costly e-commerce ventures like this, but also that its focus is getting stronger on other areas.\nSpecifically, the company has been doubling down on what is likely going to form the core of the next generation of computing, artificial intelligence, and the many applications that this will take, whether it is in powering services like transportation or providing information to Baidu’s user base. It’s also been making some acquisitions in line with this, such as its purchase of Kitt.ai earlier this summer.\n(Notably, other food-related ventures that tap into this new wave of computing, like this one with KFC to facilitate ordering using face recognition technology, will not be affected by today’s news, Baidu confirmed to TC.)\nAdditionally, Baidu is moving deeper into investing in other areas. The company now collaborating with insurance giant China Life (a partner in other investments) on a new $1 billion private equity fund called the “Baidu Fund Partnership“. Capitalized with 5.6 billion yuan from China Life and 1.4 billion from Baidu, the fund will focus on late-stage investments in tech startups with a significant presence in China with a focus on mobile, AI, and finance.\nBaidu may have lost its appetite for the food delivery market for now, but that’s not to say that there are not others who are licking their chops for more.\nEle.me continues to grow massively, and others like Uber and Amazon are also doubling down in this area, building out from their logistics operations as a base for growth. As more of our economy shifts to consumers using digital platforms to buy goods and services, there’s a clear opportunity there for those hungry to seize it.", "tags": "china,food-delivery,ele-me,baidu", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/baidu-confirms-sale-of-its-food-delivery-business-to-rival-ele-me/", "id": "1530911"}, {"title": "Business messaging service Eko picks up $2M to fuel push into Japan, US and UK", "text": "Eko Communications, a U.S.-Thailand company that operates a messaging app targeted at businesses, has closed a strategic investment of $2 million to grow in Japan and expand into Europe and the U.S..\nThe funding was led by Japanese corporate Itochu, which provided $1 million and will partner to help expand sales.

The idea is that beyond making it easy to get public Wi-Fi — because let’s face it, it is usually a struggle — Google Station offers connectivity those who might otherwise be unable to afford it, or perhaps even unaware of it entirely.\nGoogle works with a range of partners that include ISPs, venue owners and system integrators on the project.

That’s a pretty significant exit — both in name of acquirer and deal size — for Southeast Asia’s nascent yet promising tech ecosystem.\nYou’d be hard pressed to call Quantum Inventions a startup, although it certainly operating in startup style. The company was founded in 2006, over ten years ago, and it has 120 staff across offices in Singapore, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. It is focused on ‘mobility solutions’ in the consumer, automotive and government/enterprise sectors. That’s a fairly broad term but essentially it means managing data to make navigation-related services run smarter and more efficiently.\nOne example is the work that the company has done in Singapore, where its technology has been used to used to the government develop a new satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing system, which handles tolls, parking and other fees and is designed to ease congestion. Quantum Inventions works with a Mitsubishi affiliate, which won the project’s tender, and Singapore’s NCS to manage the vast data output to glean insight and information.\n“Compliance from technical standpoint very important,” Saurav Bhattacharyya, Quantum Inventions CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. “Human compliance in any kind of system is the main issue, moving towards autonomous or advanced systems you have higher level of compliance and that’s where a central-backed congestion management platform in real-time can get to many places.”\nThe company doesn’t just focus on smart cities — though that is a strength of Singapore — and its other units touch on enterprise services like fleet management, in-car consumer services, and mobile apps and data such as navigation.\nBhattacharyya said that right now, mobility data is managed in commonly managed in silos, but he said this practice will change in the future as increased usage of the cloud and city planning centralizes data and processes.\nThe business itself had become profitable with 50 percent compound growth over the past decade, so why sell now when the future is still to come?\nBhattacharyya said the initial plan was to go to market to raise funding, but after being subject to acquisition interest, Quantum Inventions looked at its options. Beyond a financial exit for investors and the team, he said it was drawn to Continental as a partner that can open doors while adding tech and other resources.\n“We had a few suitors over the last year, one of the important things for us was to ensure we have a company that knows it takes R&D to stay ahead and have global relationships,” he said. “You can raise $100 million but can’t buy relationships.”\nOn that latter point, he expects that his company will be able to develop much faster with more resources at its fingertips.\n“We come in as a strong engineering fit,” Bhattacharyya added. While the deal “leaves us independent, with the backing of Continental’s global channels — that’s testament to what we have created.”\nFor now the plan is to continue the business as it is — with an enrichment of resources — but in the future as the market changes, so the business may also shift its focus.\n“We will keep our verticals but may align to certain strengths or relationships that Continental has, but still covering automotive and cities. Logistics is very strong and we’ll intend to keep doing that, maybe couple of years down the line makes sense to harmonize platform into one,” he explained.\nContinental has been busy brokering deals in Asia lately. It recently announced a joint venture with operator China Unicom focused on transport systems, and it has partnered with Baidu to develop self-driving cars.\n“Asia continues to play an ever increasing role in our strategy,” Helmut Matschi, member of the Executive Board at Continental and head of the Interior division, said in a statement. “Now the purchase of Quantum Inventions underline our focus on developing mobility services solutions.

Hoping a title becomes a million-seller and justifies its staff and years of gestation often leads to the ruin of game studios and publishers. And that’s if the game ever even releases. But Good Shepherd has found that careful curation, help with pain points like localization, and other avenues of stewardship can make games as reliable an investment as a mutual fund, but considerably more profitable.\nThe company, founded in 2011 as Gambitious but eventually (and I’d say wisely) rebranding under the current name, basically finds promising games and makes sure they get the best chance at success possible. And it works: they’ve helped usher 15 games into the world, 12 of which have been out for at least a year and 9 of which are already profitable. The portfolio as a whole is turning a 30 percent profit.\nMore easily said than done. Independent game developers aren’t exactly widget makers; even promising titles can and do end up in development hell as the narrative is reworked, scope is adjusted, art styles are redone, and so on. A good publisher or backer will make sure these don’t torpedo the whole project.\nThe idea isn’t particularly original — it’s the kind of work that many venture funds and incubators do with young, inexperienced companies — but it hasn’t really been applied to games. Part of that is the perception that games are either hits or whiffs, making it a risky area for investment — although the same could, of course, be said of startups.\nBut the strategy of a huge release hopefully recouping all costs in a month or two is peculiar to AAA development; the latest Call of Duty costs a hundred million to make, so needs to sell 2 million copies before mainstream gamers move on to the next big franchise release.\nAn indie game doesn’t have the benefit of an Activision-size marketing team or simultaneous release in 36 countries and languages. But its budget is smaller, and people will continue buying it for years — because often the point of indie games is that they are original creations not bound to any particular console or sales cycle. Cave Story, for instance, is just as awesome today as it was in 2004 — and it still sells.\n\nUnderstanding these debit and credit columns for a class of asset is critical to making a smart investment, and that’s what Good Shepherd has focused on. I talked with Mike Wilson, co-founder of Devolver and Good Shepherd, while he was in town for PAX West. He said that the company is intensely focused on the writing, music, and other truly original parts of games — the kind of things people talk about for years.\n“The magic of what we’ve done is to remove the ‘hit’ requirement for making investing in indie games a reasonable thing to do,” Wilson told me. “We are very sensitive to giving these people a great first experience that isn’t reliant on hitting the lottery with a project breaking into the mainstream.”\n\t\nOn the other side of the business, Good Shepherd is meant to be a reliable, transparent investment vehicle for people who want to back games but don’t have any idea how to go directly to creators. Acting as intermediary to investors and critical oversight for creators, the company gets to have its cake and eat it too: out one end comes money, and out the other end comes art.\nConsidering the pedigree of the people involved (people from the games industry who have always pushed back against AAA studios) the latter would seem to be the primary goal. If you could enable people all over the world to pursue their dreams and build something cool, wouldn’t you? Fortunately, it also happens to produce quite a bit of money, which justifies it for everyone else.", "tags": "", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/good-games-make-good-investments-at-good-shepherd/", "id": "1536255"}, {"title": "Sony backs Acutronic Robotics’ hardware robot operating system", "text": "Sony is investing in Acutronic Robotics‘ Series A round, via its Sony Innovation Fund.

Too often, it seems like we are squandering our time checking devices, losing touch with fellow humans and cultivating bad habits in the pursuit of instant gratification.\nIf only an app could fix that. Preferably, it’d be one we could use all day long and did not require interacting with humans. It’d be nice to download in a couple of minutes, too.\nWelcome to the world of mindfulness and wellness apps. In the past year or so, investors have backed more than 20 startups developing apps and tools aimed at promoting mindfulness, happiness and other desirable mental states. To date, these companies have raised more than $150 million, according to Crunchbase data. Several of the largest rounds have been in recent months, with the vast majority of funding going to California-based startups.\nTake a deep breath, and we’ll take a deeper dive into where all that money is going.\nSo far, the largest funding recipient is Headspace, developer of a popular app for learning meditation techniques. The Santa Monica-based company, which closed a $37 million round in June, has raised $75 million to date. It’s a fairly straightforward business model: users start with a few free lessons and subscribe if they want to keep going.\nHeadspace bills itself as the world’s most popular meditation app, with more than 18 million downloads. Its mission, however, is much broader.\n“Meditation is just the first act,” says Ross Hoffman, Headspace’s chief business officer. Over time, the seven-year-old startup wants to build “the most comprehensive guide to health and happiness from when you’re born to when you die and everything in between.”\nIt’s in expansion mode, too, committed to what might be called happy scaling. The careers page features images of an open office space complete with sweater-knit upholstered sofas and blissful staffers nibbling salad and steamed rice. Job applicants are asked to explain how they see their role impacting the company vision of improving the health and happiness of the world.\nThere are also other well-funded startups in the space dedicated to making us feel better. Happify Health, a developer of digital tools and programs it says are “designed to motivate individuals to address the full range of their emotional needs,” has raised $25 million. And Grokker, a provider of online yoga, meditation and fitness lessons, brought in $22 million.\nThere are lots of other interesting-sounding companies that have raised seed and early-stage funding. The list includes Calm, a Headspace rival, Shine, an app that sends motivational text messages and Thrive Global, which wants to help busy people avoid burnout.\nInitial snarkiness aside, apps geared to more balanced living do appear to fill a niche in our over-connected lives. Moreover, while there may be some irony in using devices to cure the ills of digital overstimulation, there’s also some logic.\n“Technology has been the bridge that makes us more aware of everything on the planet… But it also causes us to be the multi-taskers we are and to have thousands of friends but to be lonely,” says Stuart Rudick, founding partner at Mindful Investors, a socially conscious micro VC fund. Mindful’s portfolio includes Muse, developer of a brain-sensing headband that guides wearers through meditation using changing weather sounds.\nRudick sees investor interest in mindfulness and meditation tools as an extension of the broader healthy living sector. Meditation, in particular, appears to be following a similar trajectory to that of yoga a decade or so earlier and is becoming popular with a much broader segment of the population.\nFrom an investor perspective, yoga, fitness and healthy living deals have produced some nice returns and high valuation companies, too. Yoga apparel maker Lululemon, a former venture-backed startup that went public 10 years ago, is currently valued around $8 billion. In the unicorn space, Peloton, the company behind the spinning craze, closed its last round at a $1.25 billion valuation. (We’ve aggregated a few others here.)\nThere have been disappointments, as well. A recent case in point is YogaWorks, a private equity-backed yoga studio chain that has seen its stock price cut by nearly a third since its August IPO, which already debuted below the initial projected price.\nYet investors in the mindfulness space typically aren’t looking for just financial returns. Many, like Rudick, are so-called double bottom line investors, who look for companies that provide some social benefit in addition to profit potential.\nMeditation and mindfulness practices are also popular in celebrity circles, which seems to have helped startups in the space secure funding from famous backers. Headspace’s investor lineup includes Ryan Seacrest, Jessica Alba and Jared Leto. Muse counts Ashton Kutcher as a backer. Thrive, meanwhile, is founded by well-known media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington.\nNow, celebrity support won’t turn a laggard into a unicorn.
