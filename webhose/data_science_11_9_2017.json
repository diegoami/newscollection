      "text": "Hmm, why did that person post a picture of a steeple on Instagram? Could it mean that his spirits are up? Or maybe the gray hues mean something? And where's his face? Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg Short of someone holding up a sign and saying that he or she is depressed, can Instagram postings really help diagnose depression? A recent study suggests possibly, but be careful how much you read into this study...and Instagram pictures. Here's what Andrew G. Reece from Harvard University and Christopher M. Danforth from the University of Vermont did for a study published in EPJ Data Science . They used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdwork platform to eventually recruit 166 individuals, who agreed to share their Instagram data and whether they already had a clinical diagnosis of depression (7 1 had a history of depression) . Each study subject took the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) questionnaire to identify which participants may have depression. The researchers then used computer algorithms to sift through and categorize over 43,000 photos to determine what characteristics may be associated with depression as determined by the questionnaire. People who were depressed were more likely to:\nPost bluer, darker, and grayer photos Post more frequently Have more comments on their Instagram posts Have fewer likes on their Instagram posts Post photos with human faces Show less of their face, when including a photo with their face. Not use Instagram filters to adjust the photo's brightness and coloring. Use the Inkwell filter (which would make the photo black and white) when they did use filters. Not use Valencia, filter that lightens the tint of the photo But before you get worried about those photos that you posted with only half your face sticking out of a blueberry costume that got a hundred \"what is that?\" comments but few likes, keep in mind that this is a limited study. It's difficult to draw strong conclusions from a relatively small and select sample of people. Moreover, there may be many other reasons for posting certain types of photos. For example, if you are a rabid Seattle Seahawks fan, many of your photos may be blue and gray. Similarly, if you actually play for the Seattle Seahawks, then your football helmet may be frequently obscuring part of your face. Moreover, if frequency of posting is a criteria, then what does this say every celebrity very active on Instagram...although they all probably get a lot of \"likes.\" The researchers also make a rather large leap when they say that \"our model showed considerable improvement over the ability of unassisted general practitioners to correctly diagnose depression.\" What the study compared is how well their computer algorithms was able to detect depression as determined by the questionnaire (70 percent of the time) with what percentage of those identified by the questionnaire as depressed actually had a self-reported history of depression (42 percent). Remember to get a diagnosis of depression, you first have to go to a health professional who is qualified to make such a diagnosis (e.g., a podiatrist won't be looking for this) and then you have to reveal to the health professional your symptoms. Many people who are depressed may not even regularly see a doctor. Thus, the study really didn't compare their algorithm with the abilities of a properly-trained health professional. While this study shows some interesting trends, it by no means shows a viable way of diagnosing depression. You can't diagnose depression from afar. This is true with most mental health issues with some exceptions that are usually extreme cases. For example, Alien Hand Syndrome (your hand has a life of its own) or Walking Corpse Syndrome (you believe that you are dead, not a Grateful Dead fan or really tired, but actually a zombie), and Self-Cannibalism (which is self-explanatory) may be easier to diagnose. However, these days people throw around what sound like mental health diagnoses without any proper professional evaluation...such as rivals calling each other \"nuts\", \"crazy\", \"insane\", \"depressed\", \"paranoid\", \"narcissistic\" or other things that sound like mental health labels. The often animated, energetic, and extroverted Actor Jim Carrey is an example of a celebrity who has opened about his struggles with depression, more evidence that external appearance doesn't always reveal what people are really feeling. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) Another danger is stereotyping. Our society already relies too heavily on superficial appearance to draw grand conclusions. Judging someone based on their appearance alone is laziness, and the risk is that this will extend to Instagram pictures. Rather than taking time to really get to know people before making judgments, might you say \"she doesn't have enough likes for me\" or \"too many black-and-white photos, something must be going on\" or \"hmm, that pet pig keeps covering part of his face\"? Of course, studies have shown that depression is both under-diagnosed and under-treated, meaning that there needs to be more ways of identifying those who could use help. This stems from several issues such as: The unnecessary stigma of mental health issues that prevents people from seeking assistance. Lack of awareness and self-awareness. Poor access to health care. Many, younger people especially, don't regularly see a doctor. Lack of time among health professionals. When you've got only fifteen minutes to see a patient, how can you adequately screen for depression. Lack of training for health professionals. Health professionals may not know how to screen for depression. Shortage of mental health professionals. How can Instagram possibly help? It's hard to say. You probably don't want to start sifting though everyone's Instagram posts to determine who may be depressed. And I don't quite see a doctor saying \"take off your shirt, take a deep breath, and show me your Instagram posts\" or \"I've been following you on Instagram lately. What's up with the lack of filters?\" Routinely diagnosing depression solely or largely on Instagram posts just should not happen. At most, your Instagram posts can be part of a larger picture. It can be the beginning of a conversation, something that spurs you check on someone. If you notice that the nature of your friend's posts have changed, you may want to check if everything is OK with him or her...but don't start throwing around depression diagnoses just yet. Instagram can never replace real direct human interaction. In fact, replacing direct human interaction may contribute to feelings of depression. A recent British survey found that of the five most popular social media platforms Instagram was the most likely to lead to or worsen anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying, body image problems, and other mental and emotional health issues . This findings was in The Royal Society for Public Health's (RSPH) and the Youth Health Movement's (YMH) new report, #StatusOfMind . The report includes results from a survey, conducted from February 13 to May 8 this year, of 1,479 people in the 14 to 24 year old age group in the United Kingdom. Therefore, instead of just Instagramming your friends, stop by and see how they are doing in person, even if their posts have a lot of strawberries, traffic cones, and jugs of urine, use a lot of filters, have few comments but lots of likes, and never include human faces.",

      "text": "Why AI is now at the heart of our innovation economy Posted Video evidence is meaningless without accountability Andrew Keen Contributor Andrew Keen is the author of three books: Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo and The Internet Is Not The Answer. He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On. More posts by this contributor: Does Silicon Valley have a moral responsibility to stop developing robots? There are few more credible authorities on artificial intelligence (AI) than Hilary Mason the New York-based founder and chief executive of the data science and machine learning consultancy Fast Forward Labs . \nSo, I asked Mason, who is also the Data Scientist in Residence at Accel Partners and the former Chief Scientist at Bitly, whether today’s AI revolution is for real? Or is it, I wondered, just another catch-all phrase used by entrepreneurs and investors to describe the latest Silicon Valley mania? \nMason – who sees “AI” as the “umbrella term” to describe “machine learning” and “big data” – acknowledges that it has become a “very trendy” area of start-up activity. That said, she says, there has been such rapid technological progress in machine learning over the last five years to make the field “legitimately exciting”. This progress has been so profound, Mason insists, that it is making AI “close” to the heart of our new innovation economy. \nBut in contrast with the fears of prominent technologists like Elon Musk, Mason doesn’t worry about the threat to the human species of super intelligent machines. We humans, she says, use machines as tools — and the advent of AI doesn’t change this. “Machines aren’t rational,” she thus argues, implying that there are many more important things for us to worry about than an imminent singularity . \nWhat does concern Mason, however, are questions about the role of women in tech. That’s a question interviewers like myself should be asking men rather than women, she insists. It just creates “extra burden” for female technologists and thus isn’t something that she wants to publicly discuss. \nMany thanks to the folks at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce for their help in producing this interview.

      "text": "A former employee of the lending startup Social Finance, better known as SoFi, has filed a California lawsuit alleging that he was fired for reporting sexual harassment of female coworkers. The plaintiff’s lawyer says a broader class-action lawsuit will be filed next week on behalf of mistreated SoFi employees. The lawsuit also reportedly alleges impropriety in the handling of loans and loan applications at the company. That includes managers manipulating records to boost their own pay, a charge reminiscent of a massive scandal that recently engulfed Wells Fargo. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The lawsuit was filed by Brandon Charles, who according the New York Times, only worked at a SoFi loan processing office for a few months. During that time, the lawsuit claims his manager used “explicit sexual innuendo” when speaking, and made “lewd, sexualized gestures” when referring female employees. Charles claims he was fired after reporting the behavior, and was told that reporting it to his supervisors was outside of his “appropriate duties.” A spokesman for SoFi told the Times that an internal investigation had found Charles’ claims to have “no merit.” A spokesperson later told Fortune that SoFi managers cannot un-assign loan applications once assigned to a reviewer and loan applications cannot be cancelled except by the applicant themselves or by time expiration. SoFi, while fundamentally a finance company, has cultivated tech-world cachet by touting its data science and quirky culture. Now it will join a less-appealing techie club—controversies over sexual harassment and gender discrimination have recently roiled Uber, venture capital funds, and, just last week, Google.",

      "text": "By Ananth Narayanan\nWe are going through some interesting times in India. Our GDP is expected to grow at 7.5% in 2017-18, which is remarkable considering the global GDP growth is at 3.5%.\nThe Indian middle class with a higher disposable income is expected to double by 2025 to $550 million with rising Internet penetration. There are over 450 million Internet users in the country today — only 28% Internet penetration. 80% of this Internet consumption is through mobile phones that has led to a digital revolution in the country. This revolution has touched all aspects of the life of Indians: across healthcare, fashion, banking, eating out, booking movie tickets and finding a life partner.\nIn developed markets, leading global brands have realised the impact that digital has on a brand. They adopted ‘Digital First’ strategies to help them grow. Companies such as spectacles-seller Warby Parker and fashion and beauty retailer ASOS started online first, built a robust brand, and then expanded to physical stores.\nIn Asia, after the success of the Chinese ecommerce sector, the next big market is India. One of the biggest industries to be impacted by this revolution here is retail. Digital has enabled people to shop by just tapping on their phones, without having to visit a physical store.\nIndians from far-flung corners of the country now have access to the best of brands, which are delivered right to their doorstep. It has made companies realise that they need to reimagine the way they do business and engage customers. They need to go beyond traditional retail formats and television advertising to reach digitally savvy customers.\nThe Shop That Never Closes\nWith people, especially the ‘millennials’ and the latest ‘Generation Z’, consuming more than half the information around them digitally, the time is ripe for brands to leverage this opportunity and create consumer journeys online. This is particularly relevant for these consumers who share their consumption stories online.\nBuilding brands in India used to be very difficult due to the fragmented nature of the market and lack of consumer data. In recent times, we have seen this change. Roadster, an outdoor lifestyle brand, is completely online, and is now among the fastest-growing apparel brands in India. This was made possible by using the consumer data to create products to cater to consumer needs, and leveraging manufacturing capacity to ‘Make in India’ quickly, with high quality.\nThe cost of communicating with customers, or selling a brand proposition through digital channels, is also dramatically lower in comparison to mainstream media such as television and print advertising.\nBrands that create strong digital experiences continue to attract new customers and gain their loyalty, as evident by the number of digital touch points that continue to increase by 20% annually. More offline customers are shifting to online, and younger, more digital-oriented shoppers are joining the ranks of these consumers each year, as a McKinsey study confirms.\nThe key now is to sustainably build a strong brand on social platforms with consistent communication. Digital First brands are going to be the future of brand-building in India. These brands are quick to scale. The success is visible. The aforementioned Roadster is already a Rs 650 crore brand with 2.5 million customers within five years and counting.\nSuch brands have been built successfully through effective storytelling that connects consistently with the brand’s principles. This is enabling them to register over 80% growth each year, which is far ahead of established conventional, older brands.\nTailor-Made Data\nThe key ingredients to building Digital First brands are:\n1. Engaging Content: With approximately 400 hours of videos uploaded on YouTube every minute, 100 million hours of videos watched on Facebook every day and three million photos shared on Instagram every hour globally, it is very important for a brand to create a compelling story and a seamless digital experience to break the clutter. The content should be engaging, bite-sized and interactive to allow consumers to communicate with the brand and provide suggestions and feedback for improvement.\n2. Consumer Insights : Online brands must leverage data science to understand their consumers ‘deeply’: their preferences, spending and shopping patterns, geography, etc. This will enable the brands to tailor their products in line with customer needs and help build the brand faster.\n3. Leveraging Technology: Technology can truly disrupt the way fashion is accessed and consumed. For instance, an entire product life-cycle — right from predicting demand and trends, design, managing production, replenishment, and determining the most optimal pricings — can be done through artificial intelligence (AI). This helps reduce time to manufacture, and cuts down wastage in the system.\nSuccessful, global and Digital First brands will be built in India over the next decade, with these elements.\n(The writer is CEO, Myntra-Jabong)",

      "text": "903 shares \nWe’re used to hearing that AI and machine learning is hopelessly complex, impossible to implement quickly, and that if you want to get on board the machine learning bandwagon you’ll need to invest heavily in PhDs, specialists and expensive experts. \nThis way of thinking is simplistic and behind the times: machine learning is a broad set of technologies, and over the past few months and years there have been huge strides in making machine learning’s benefits much more accessible to startups, scale ups and lone developers alike. \nOver the past few months I’ve spent a great deal of time investigating, learning about and iterating on a number of different machine learning technologies to take advantage of the vast quantities of time series data we have about infrastructure performance from my company’s product. \nWe’re collecting billions of metrics every data from hundreds of thousands of systems, all of which can be used to understand patterns and make future predictions. Read on for some easy, actionable advice on how to get started from scratch with machine learning — it’s easier than you think! Avoid TensorFlow — for now \nGoogle made headlines in 2015 by open-sourcing TensorFlow, their internal AI and machine learning framework. Released as an open source project, TensorFlow is following the same strategy as Kubernetes — provide such a good product that it becomes the industry standard, and offer a hosted, managed cloud version for those who don’t want to maintain it themselves. \nYou can run TensorFlow workloads yourself but Google’s Cloud Machine Learning Platform offers a much more optimised version, running on proprietary TensorFlow Processing Unit chipsets. The strategy is all about making Google Cloud the best choice for these jobs. \nHowever, popularity can be deceptive and based on my personal experience TensorFlow is often not the best solution for startups and small companies. TensorFlow is great in that you get a high degree of control over your project but that control comes at a cost. TensorFlow is a framework, and we’ve found it requires significant data science knowledge and a lot of trial and error in building, iterating and improving your models. \nIt’s not a toolset you should pick up if you’re after easy results or plug-and-play functionality. Unless you’re a big corporation (which we’re not) or have the budgets to hire data scientists to get into model development, it might be tricky to secure enough budget to invest in TensorFlow from the start, so you’d be much better trying more simplistic managed solutions first. The rise of ‘machine-learning-as-a-service’ \nFor companies just starting out, the best place to begin is looking at the managed service solutions from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These solutions are much more accessible to generalist teams, and companies that use them get the benefit of vendors updating them and improving service over time. Indeed, your own datasets help to improve the models! \nThis is because the larger the training data set, the more accurate the models can be. Anyone can play with theoretical models but the truly interesting work comes out of having real data, and this is an advantage the big players have even before they add your data into the mix. \nWe’ve found that Amazon Machine Learning is a great place to start. AML differs from TensorFlow in a number of ways: with TensorFlow, you build your own models and can then execute them against your datasets wherever you like whereas AML requires you upload your dataset to Amazon then use their API to execute queries. The downside is you don’t get to control the models and can’t see into the workings of the system – you rely on Amazon to get it right. This “plug and play” type approach but is less customised and flexible, so you may end up needing replacing it with something more specialist in the future. \nIf you need a very particular type of functionality — detecting items in a video, speech to text or translation, then there are specialist services from all the cloud providers. These services use machine learning behind the scenes, but you don’t need to think about it — send over the item for analysis and get the results through an API. These APIs are quite specific and so if they do a good job, you can just leave them to get on with it. It’s unlikely you’ll want to customise them enough to make it worth starting from scratch. \nOutside of the big three cloud providers, there are a host of technology startups including Algorthmia, BigML and MLJar aiming to offer machine learning through an API or SaaS application. Put your use cases first \nI’ve seen many companies make the mistake of rushing into machine learning without having a clear use case in mind, and this is a significant error. There are robust ecosystems around each of the above ‘MLaaS’ platforms, and so you’ll need to have awareness of the APIs available to you. Tools like Amazon Polly (text to speech) or the Google Cloud Video Intelligence API deliver specialist functionality without requiring a high degree of knowledge as a prerequisite. \nSince they are offered as an API, you can mix and match across providers and even test which does a better job where the service is the same. Most people will probably stick with the cloud platform the rest of their infrastructure is hosted on, but that’s not always necessary (data transfer cost and latency may become an issue once you hit scale though). \nAt my company, we’ve been migrating from IBM Softlayer to Google Cloud and the data transfer fees of (encrypted) traffic across the internet is part of the total cost consideration, and an incentive to complete the move quickly! Once it’s all within Google’s network then the lower (or zero) data fees apply when using their services, and Google is widely considered to have well designed machine learning capabilities. \nI’ve found the advantage of using machine learning as a service APIs is that any developer can pick them up and start playing. Serious machine learning with TensorFlow requires a lot of time and real data science knowledge, which may be worth investing in over the long term. However, to get something up and running quickly and test the value proposition to your users, there are a variety of options. \nI’ve had a lot of fun testing out the different machine learning APIs and solutions out there, and this element of fun and discovery makes it much easier to lead a team on a small exploratory project. I’ve also found that implementing something like Google’s 20 percent time, or even an internal hackathon could also be a good opportunity to get everyone focused on building an initial prototype. \nMachine learning is a very over-hyped set of technologies — it’s currently ranked by Gartner as a buzzword , at the very top of their peak of inflated expectations. However there’s a vibrant set of technologies under this umbrella term, and you don’t necessarily need to have a highly-specialised workforce to take advantage of them. Start small, use the managed services provided by the big tech firms, and you’ll be surprised by how far you can go.",

      "text": "Banks exploring use of artificial intelligence in operations Anil Urs Shutterstock.com Transformation time By adopting AI and machine learning, some banks have automated operational processes, resulting in cost reduction and faster turn-around time \nA few banks have already initiated the process of institutionalising advanced analytics capabilities, says Quadratic Insights CEO Bengaluru, August 13: Several banks have started exploring adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in their operational processes. “There is substantial attention being paid in bank boardrooms nowadays on deployment of AI and ML,” Sreerama KV Murthy, Chief Executive Officer, Quadratic Insights, told BusinessLine . “A few banks have already initiated the process of building centralised data lakes and institutionalising advanced analytics capabilities, either internally or through captive vendors,” he added. By adopting AI and ML, some banks have automated operational processes, resulting in cost reduction and faster turn-around time. Some non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), payments banks, insurance companies, investment advisory companies and online financial service providers are also looking to upgrade their processes. According to Murthy, banking operations are highly process-oriented and data-intensive. For example, to open a bank account, a person submits a set of forms and supporting documents. The data in these are systematically scrutinised by the bank before approving the account opening. Likewise in disbursals, there are systematic approval processes for providing personal, corporate, and agricultural loans. “In addition, there are systematic and data-centric processes banks use for quantifying and minimising risk, customer support, hiring and retaining staff, detecting and blocking fraud, forecasting and avoiding delinquencies, and identifying existing and new customers for marketing of new products and services,” he explained. Murthy said Quadratyx is an IP-centric services company working in the space of AI, ML, big data and analytics. The company so far has served, among others, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Cibil, NPCI, Murugappa Group, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Novartis and AT&T. “It would not be unreasonable to predict that, within the next five years, most medium and large public and private banks in India will have substantial data science, AI and ML initiatives institutionalised,” said Murthy.

      "text": "Exclusive: Google buys Seattle health monitoring startup Senosis, bolstering digital health push By John Cook on August 13, 2017 at 4:39 pm Computer scientist and electrical engineer Shwetak Patel. His most recent venture, Senosis, developed apps for smartphones that can help diagnose disease. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) \nShwetak Patel has struck again. \nThe University of Washington computer scientist has sold his newest Seattle startup company, Senosis Health , to Google, according to sources familiar with the deal. \nIt marks the latest acquisition for Patel, whose past startup ventures have landed in the hands of companies such as Belkin International and Sears . \nPatel, who founded Senosis Health with four other clinicians, researchers and tech transfer experts from the University of Washington, won a MacArthur genius grant in 2011 and his past innovations have ranged from energy meters to air quality sensors . \nWith Senosis, Patel and his team of about a dozen engineers and physicians took on a bigger challenge: Turning smartphones into monitoring devices that collect health metrics to diagnose pulmonary function, hemoglobin counts and other critical health information. \nThe company’s apps – including SpiroSmart and SpiroCall, HemaApp and OsteoApp – were under review by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year when GeekWire first wrote about the novel concept . At the time, Patel seemed especially bullish on the idea of using the enhanced cameras, accelerometers and microphones of modern-day smartphones as a new type of health care diagnostic tool. Senosis’ HemaApp \n“Those sensors that are already on the mobile phone can be repurposed in interesting new ways, where you can actually use those for diagnosing certain kinds of diseases,” Patel said. \nPatel declined to comment when contacted by GeekWire on Sunday afternoon, and representatives for Google were not immediately available for comment. \nHowever, Patel was a recent guest on the GeekWire Health Tech Podcast where he spoke at length about Senosis and why he started the company. \nPatel told us that he’s “always been interested in solving grand challenges” of which health care is certainly one. \nNow, Patel will just be putting his creative energy to work solving the grand health care challenge for Google. Listen to the full episode with Patel here: \nThe acquisition of Senosis does represent Google’s continued interest in the digital health arena. In 2015, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, launched a new subsidiary known as Verily which was designed to bring together technology, data science and healthcare in a way that would allow people to “enjoy longer and healthier lives.” \nInterestingly, Verily’s CTO, Brian Otis , also has ties to the University of Washington where he previously worked as an associate professor in the department of electrical engineering. While at the UW, Otis founded a chip design research lab that developed tiny, low power wireless chips, according to his LinkedIn profile. Alphabet’s artificial intelligence unit, DeepMind, also established a health unit last year with the goal of saving lives and improving health care. \nPatel and his colleagues at Senosis are not joining the Verily team, and it’s unclear where they will fit in the greater Alphabet family, the parent company of Google. One source told GeekWire that the Senosis team will remain at Google, forming the backbone of a digital health effort based in Seattle. \nIt’s also unclear how much was paid for Senosis, which was in the process of raising a series A financing round from leading venture capital firms when the acquisition offer materialized. \nSeattle area entrepreneur T.A. McCann was put in place to help raise the venture capital round, and serve as the CEO of Senosis. However, the acquisition talks heated up, and as a result the venture funding was put on the backburner. \nSenosis never raised venture capital, and instead was bankrolled in its early months through more than $1 million from the Small Business Innovation Research program. \nThe other founders of Senosis included Dr. Jim Stout , a professor of pediatrics and an adjunct professor of health services at the University of Washington; Dr. Margaret Rosenfeld , an attending physician at Seattle Childrens Hospital and Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine; Dr. Jim Taylor of the University of Washington, and Mike Clarke, the former associate director in UW’s technology transfer office. \nYou can get a better idea of the concept behind Senosis in this video.

      "text": "Fired Google Engineer James Damore Takes His Case to Reddit Tom McKay | Gawker Media Aug 14, 2017, 04.36 AM IST \nJames Damore, the Google engineer who was fired after posting a 10-page memo calling the company an \" Ideological Echo Chamber \" and arguing women are underrepresented in tech because of inherent differences, has taken his side of the story to one of the friendliest venues imaginable: Reddit. \nIn an AMA session on the /r/JamesDamore subreddit, Damore took a number of questions from people who largely seemed to be supporters. While Damore's critics have largely focused around his belief the claims he put forth in the memo are just science-disregarding the way science is conducted and interpreted has always been shaped by social forces like sexism and racism -the ex-Googler showed no signs of a change in perspective. Advertisement \nIt's perhaps not surprising Damore, who responded to the firing by getting a t-shirt labeled \"Goolag,\" remains convinced he was wronged by Google management. In his AMA posts, Damore expressed the belief he would ultimately be proven right and tech companies would have to respond to his concerns. \nIn one post, Damore wrote that he still has allies within Google, but they are \"afraid of 'coming out of the closet.'\" Image: Screengrab via Reddit \nDamore also replied to a user who asked what his response to critics that said \"you shouldn't circulate long-form politically-charged manifestos in the workplace,\" portraying his creation of the screed as a form of whistleblowing. Advertisement \n\"I was participating in a concerted effort to discuss the terms and conditions of my working environment and point out potentially illegal policies/behavior,\" Damore said. \"I believe I have a legal right to do that.\" \nIn response to the same user, Damore advised young programmers to seek out companies which weren't so \"ideologically driven\" and accused the \"mainstream media\" of \"misrepresenting me.\" Image: Screengrab via Reddit \nIn another post, Damore listed his criticisms of the coverage, saying he was falsely portrayed as \"anti-diversity/misogynist,\" and disagreeing that anything he wrote suggested women were less capable engineers instead of merely disinterested in coding. He also said he had not heard that Google was \"actually paying the media to trash me,\" but added he believed \"some of Google's adwords relationships are partisan.\" Advertisement \nDamore also said he did not believe women were \"neurotic,\" despite claiming in the original document that women, on average, experience more \"neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance).\" Image: Screengrab via Reddit \nDamore also explained why he thought minorities were getting preferential treatment in the hiring process at Google. Image: Screengrab via Reddit \nAnother user challenged him to consider whether the reason more conservatives don't work in the technology field on the same grounds he proposed regarding women in the memo. Damore dismissed the notion, blaming it on a liberal culture at tech companies. Advertisement \n\"It's likely a combination of both cultural differences, less openness, and a feeling of being alienated by academia and tech,\" he wrote. \"I wouldn't necessarily expect equal proportion conservatives and progressives, but we shouldn't make conservatives feel like they need to stay in the closet.\" Image: Screengrab via Reddit \nFinally, in another series of posts, Damore said he was surprised by the reaction to his memo because \"I thought that talking about the ideological echo chamber and the dangers of authoritarian leftist policies, that it would pacify some of the reactions that I got.\" He also said he had \"assumed that Google engineers would be more data/science driven than they apparently are.\" Advertisement \nDamore also claimed \"most that see the progressive echo chamber for what it is support me\" and said Google could not address his allegations right now because the topic was too \"emotionally charged.\" \nHe also wrote he would have \"to admit ignorance about many of people's past and political positions and that's a weakness of mine,\" which was why he asked far-right activist Mike Cernovich to tweet out the \"Goolag\" shirt. (This doesn't explain why he chose to invoke the imagery of Soviet forced labor camps in the first place.) Image: Screengrab via Reddit Image: Screengrab via Reddit \nAs Gizmodo reported last week, there's considerably more to Damore's story than this. While he was attending Harvard, two administrators apologized for a skit Damore performed in at the 2012 Systems Biology Program Retreat, saying it had \"presented material that offended many members of our community.\" Advertisement \nDamore's claim the company broke labor law by terminating him also relies upon a specific interpretation of National Labor Relations Act rules that is, at the very least, legally debatable . Then there's the whole idea Damore was just presenting scientific reality to his coworkers, which again, relies on the assumption his view of scientific reality isn't colored by his personal beliefs .",

Don’t get us wrong, they are great places to learn data science and machine learning theory with practice problems. However, they don’t teach good business practices, and how to operate a data team in a business settings. Knowing algorithms, and how to use Hadoop is not enough to have an effective data team . Advice To Data Science Teams Teams have to work with other departments, they have to maintain software, report to executives, and of course, return business value! Data science, like analytics and business intelligence are just tools to help make the business more effective at making money. None of this is discussed in most data science classes. That is why, one of our key focuses is not just custom data science algorithms and models, but also data science team development. We wanted to offer some great tips that will help your data science team be more succesful. This has nothing to do with algorithms and models, and everything with how data specialist need to operate in a business: ROI Vs. Algorithms And Technology As programmers, data scientists, and engineers. Most of us often prefer to focus on the technical aspects of our data projects or software we are developing. The reasons we develop products is not solely money, but to prove that we can do something. It is a challenge! We are problem solvers. Maybe we want to prove that we can develop an algorithm that can predict whether a product is a Hot Dog or Not a Hot Dog. Just for fun! However, at the end of the day, us data scientists, data consultants, and software engineers are hired by businesses. At the end of the day, those businesses want to see fiscal results. It doesn’t really matter whether your use a neural network or a support vector machine based algorithm, which result either saves the most money, or brings in the most revenue. It is important to remember, because the soon a data scientists or big data analyst can figure this out. The more effective they are in their role. Part of being a data scientists is having a slight entrepreneurial spirit . Data specialists seek out opportunities to save the company money, or find new value streams. We are often right too, because we not only understand the business but we have the data to back our insights. That is one of the values of having a data team that is well attuned with your business. They have data to drive their decisions. Data Engineering One area that can occasionally be rushed is data engineering . It might seem unimportant, it might seem easy to change. However, if data isn’t engineered in an easy to manipulate and develop method. Data scientists will have one hell of a time trying to design their algorithms and workflows downstream. There is a reason data engineers are still a higher percentage of job requests over data scientists on indeed.com . How the data is structured plays a large role in analytics. Our team has several members who originally were data engineers and this is why they are so valuable. They are able to create not only beautiful algorithms but also data pipelines that flow naturally from point A to point B. From data warehouse to algorithm. Data engineered well is easy to modify, easy to allow new modules and report metrics, etc. It may seem strange, but it is all possible with good data engineering! System Design Is For Data Scientists Too When designing an algorithm , it can be easy to forget that the results need to actually be implemented into production. Data scientists don’t just design an algorithm and finish there. Instead, there is a need typically for some form of data warehouse, or data storage center to act as a system that both feeds and records the data from the models developed. The algorithm is not an isolated island that creates dollars on it’s own. There will also typically be some form of interface that a user can interact with. This might be a website, or a dashboard for instance. The purpose is to let the end user have actionable and understandable insights ported to them directly. Rather than them having to translate random numbers and outputs from models. This can get overlooked when simply doing a Kaggle problem or creating a project in class. This is why programs like Galvanize partner their students with actual businesses, because putting an algorithm into production requires more than just developing it. There are old systems to work with, API documentation to sift through, bugs, work arounds, and of course, corporate politics. Corporate Politics, Yes, You Will Get Involved Businesses always have politics. There is no way to get around it. Data science executives and program leaders need to be able to work with other teams and get funding just like the rest of the departments. This requires understanding what other executives want and need and making sure they back your projects. If they are not backing your projects, if they are wiating to stab you in the back(and that happens), your project will fail. Do not manipulate, but guide other team leaders to your view point, or barter, or comprimise. Just make sure you don’t start stepping on everyones toes…at least, not until your data team has proven itself a few times. Even then, don’t become to difficult to work with. Otherwise, no one will every give your business team resources. Documentation Is A Data Team’s Friend Ok, 85% of programmers need to own up to something. They hate documentation. It’s ok, it is not exactly the most fun thing. However, it is important to constantly be documenting! Don’t wait until the project is over to document!!! Data science algorithms, data structures, and software need to be constantly documented. No one is asking your data team to write the next Tom Swayer. Just keep legible and understandable notes that any other programmer can pick up. You never know when a team member will leave, and thus, leave a bunch of half finished projects with no documentation behind. Thus, for the sake of maintenance, get your data teams documenting their projects as they go. It will save your team hundreds of hours worth of technical debt and ensure your products continue to operate. Data Science Projects Need A Software QA and Life Cycle Data science is an arm of software development. That means it requires a process to ensure the code that is developed is robust and maintainable. How you ask? By having a great QA process for both the code and the data, and making sure there is a standardized process for code to go from development to production. No, you should not test code on production! That’s how things go wrong!!! Don’t get us wrong, you need to push code out, but not at the expense that your code will break the build. Peer reviews, QA, and unit testing can save your data teams a lot of grief. Make sure there are not constant impediments, like an engineer who takes forever to peer review someone else’s code. At the same time, make sure you’re not developing straight to production!! Data Science Is Not All About Algorithms The truth about data science and analytics is it is not a magic bullet. It is really just another tool businesses can use to increase their profits and decrease their costs. When operated correctly, it creates a huge competitive advantage. When data is engineered well, and the teams function well with the rest of the business. Our data consultants specialize in making sure your team is operating at full capacity. Sure, we love solving data science and machine learning problems. However, we also offer awesome coaching and workshops to help develop you team members! We come in with both data science and business professionals who know how to make sure your team is operating with the business. This way, you are getting the full benefit of using data to drive your value streams! Whether it is big data, small data, let us know how we can serve you today! Read more about data science below!

      "text": "To see where British fast-fashion retailer Asos is spending the most of its resources, download its mobile app.\nBuilt in-house, the app has 10 million downloads according to the company, and it’s also the focus of the retailer’s latest technology investments, coming from its 900-person tech team, which Asos plans to grow by another 200 next year. The app is home to features like AI-driven product search, mobile payments and a fit analytics function, all meant to put some muscle behind the often finicky mobile shopping experience.\nMost recently, Asos rolled out a visual search tool to U.K. iPhone app users that lets shoppers take a photo of a product they like in-app, and it pulls similar items from a pool of 85,000 product images. The feature will be introduced to Android and international markets next, including the U.S., wear Asos has invested $40 million in building out a distribution center.\n“Our number one priority is: We need to build experiences that capitalize on mobile,” said Rich Jones, Asos’s head of product and UX. “We’re designing experiences that are essentially right for the customers’ devices because their entire lives are here. How do we make sure our experience matches that?”\nIt helps that the majority of Asos’s traffic and conversions are happening there. Globally, 70 percent of traffic and 58 percent of purchases happen on mobile. In the U.K., where Asos is headquartered, those figures creep up, to 80 percent and 70 percent for traffic and conversions, respectively.\nJones said that when figuring out how to improve the mobile app, the technology team turns to customer pain points and figures out how to solve them. One of Asos’s strengths is its vast inventory of 85,000 products from 200 brands, and it’s resonating with customers. In its latest earnings report for the third quarter of 2017, retail sales were up 32 percent, to $859 million, putting it on track to hit $103 million in profits for the year. For their most recent results, Asos outpaced competitors like Zara, where sales rose 17 percent, and H&M, which saw a 9 percent sales bump.\nBut while scrolling through endless product pages is suitable for desktop, such a dense assortment is difficult to digest on mobile, a problem Jones and his team set out to fix.\nGlossy Hot Topic: Influencer Marketing August 24, 2017 New York, NY REGISTER NOW Digiday Research: How companies fund emerging tech Join Digiday+ for access “It’s frustrating to find products. How do we remove that friction? How do we solve the ‘I don’t know what to wear’ problem? We want to do the heavy lifting,” said Jones. “We can show you 10,000 products if you just type in ‘dresses,’ but we want to get to the point where we can show you five or 10 that really gel with you and understand you.”\nJones thinks visual search will help solve the problem of narrowing down assortment and getting customers straight to the products they’re looking for. For example, a search for “pink shoes” on the Asos app pulls up close to 500 results, including a mix of peach loafers and pink glitter platforms. But when using visual search, a photo of hot pink booties gives you 100 results, closely matching in style and shade.\nThe visual search tool in the Asos app\nStill, Jones admitted there’s a learning curve around that tool when it comes to customer behavior — for as much as retailers have tested the “Shazam for retail” function , it’s not common practice yet to search by images. He also said that visual search only accounts for customers who know what it is they’re looking for. To account for those who are just in the market for something broad, like a dress, the company is using machine learning, big data and AI to personalize the app more every time it’s opened.\n“Personalization and data usage have now moved to a whole different game — this is now data science and artificial intelligence,” said Asos CEO Nick Beighton, on a July call with investors. “So we have had recommendations live on our apps for several years now, which is AI using data to power customer choices. We are now doubling down on that: using data to enhance the customer experience. Every customer to come through the app is getting a better experience next time he or she comes.”\nJones said that Asos is focusing on improving its handle on personalization based on customer behavior and preferences. Right now, the company uses a third-party partner to track data, but it plans to bring it in house. The company’s next big mobile launch is AVA, a virtual assistant on mobile, which will help customers search for products and keep a profile on their demographics, including size and preferences.\n“AI understands, more than anything else, feedback. Down to a click, customer behavior is the ultimate driver of AI and machine learning techniques,” said Eric Brassard, a former Saks Fifth Avenue executive and founder of AI recommendation company Propulse Analytics. “This is where the big impact of AI in a field like fashion is — it can take endless data and deliver the answers, because it simplifies it on a human-like level.”",

      "text": "Using Predictive Analytics and Python on SAP Cloud Platform HANA database – Part 1 August 14, 2017 | 13 Views | Follow \nI was recently working with a customer who was interested in doing Predictive Analytics on top of the HANA database which they recently subscribed to on SAP Cloud Platform. They already have an on-premise server for Predictive Suite and have been using their tools against an on-premise HANA database. I this blog, I wanted to share my experience to highlight how easy it is to do the same on a HANA database on the Cloud Platform. \n\nOnce you have a HANA database subscribed on your Cloud Platform account, its important to note that you will need an additional subscription to Predictive services on the Cloud Platform too. The Predictive service on Cloud Platform offers REST based APIs which can be used in custom applications that you would build on the Cloud Platform. If you would like to know more about this service, you can go through the blog “ Introducing SAP Cloud Platform predictive services “. I have also posted on this topic earlier showing how to use these REST APIs “ Capture event streams from IoT devices and perform predictive analytics ” \nIn this scenario, we are not going to leverage the REST APIs as we are going to use the on-premise PA Suite to handle complex use cases. \nOnce you have subscribed to Predictive Service, you can navigate to your database and click on “Install Components” \nThe system will give you a self-service option to install the APL Libraries you want. Note, it is recommended to have the version of APL match the version on your on-premise PA suite. \nOnce the APL libraries are installed on your HANA database, the next thing to do is to setup your Cloud Connector. Follow this tutorial to setup/install your Cloud Connector and setup connectivity to your Cloud Platform account. \nThe next step would be select “On-premise to Cloud” option within the Cloud Connector to setup a service channel for your database connection. If you would like to know more about how to configure a service channel, here is a blog by Manjunath . \nIn the example below, I have given the local instance number “98” for my HANA instance “hcpta” \nAfter you save the settings, you can now access the hcpta instance using the host name where the Cloud Connector is installed and Port = 39815. In my example, I have installed the Cloud Connector on my laptop and hence will refer to it as localhost. \nSearch for ODBC Data Source in your programs and under “System DSN” maintain a new data source connection. In the below screen, I have maintained one with the name “HCP” \nIn the connection details, I have provided localhost:39815. When I try to test the connection, it will ask me for the HANA DB user credentials and it will give a successful message if everything works fine. I have got Cloud Connector, ODBC and PA software all on the same laptop. \nFor demonstration purposes, I have created a schema ADM_DEMO which has demo data on banking customers and their transactions. The transaction table has got millions of records which we can use for predicting the customer churn. \nI am going to show to get started with Predictive Analytics (on-premise) and connect to HANA DB on SAP Cloud Platform. I am not an expert on PA, but just showing a very basic scenario which created a table back in HANA. I would recommend using Predictive Analytics 3.2 version. \nLaunch the PA software on your laptop and click on “Create Data Manipulation” under Data Manger. \nIn the Data sources, select the one created in ODBC and provide the HANA DB login credentials. \nSelect the Table by browsing through the available schemas. \nI have taken the Disposition table to begin with. \nI can navigate to the Views tab and explore the data of this table. \nNext, I am using the Merge option to connect with the Accounts table \nAccount_ID is the key which links both the table. I repeat the same steps for adding Client table. \nOnce I have added all the tables and linked the keys, I can view the SQL which the system has generated. \nI can also view the contents of this Dynamic SQL within PA. \nI can apply filters, for example to only consider Client Type with a value “Owner” \nOnce I have put the relevant filters and set the aggregations which are required, I can now save the data back into HANA as a view. In the below example, I have given the name of a table PA_CHURN. \nAfter execution of this step, I can now view the processed table available in HANA database. \nIn the next blog, I will show you how to connect a python program to perform data science. This has been also coming up as a frequent question especially around customers who are implementing Predictive Analytics. Alert Moderator",

BillGuard: BillGuard is a personal finance security company that alerts users to bad chargers. The company has expertise in big data mining, machine learning algorithms, security and consumer Web UX. 3. Content/Information Extraction Information Extraction has been a major application of machine learning. It involves extraction from Web content like articles, publications, documents etc. The various companies using these applications are mentioned below: Dataminr: Dataminr is a leading real-time information discovery company. Dataminr transforms real-time data from Twitter and other public sources into actionable signals, identifying the most relevant information in real time for clients in the financial sector. It trawls social media and other information sources using complex machine learning algorithms to identify significant or newsworthy posts and then flags them for its clients in real time. AlphaSense: AlphaSense is a financial search engine that solves fundamental problems of information abundance and fragmentation for knowledge professionals. It leverages proprietary natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to provide a powerful and highly differentiated product with an intuitive user interface. 4. Fraud Detection and Identity Management According to IBM research, fraud costs the financial industry approximately $80 billion annually; US credit and debit card issuers alone lost $2.4 billion. “We are able to apply complicated logic that is outside the realm of human analysis to huge quantities of streaming data.” — Manager, Machine Learning Technologies Group, IBM Research With the help of machine learning, fraud detection techniques can be made efficient and effective. The solutions created can analyze historical transaction data to build a model that can detect fraudulent patterns. Companies are also using machine learning for biometric authentication. Here are the companies working in this field: Feedzai: Feedzai uses machine learning and big data science to make commerce safe. Feedzai machine learning models detect fraud up to 30% earlier than traditional methods. Bionym: Bionym has developed a biometric authentication device using ECG backed with machine learning algorithms.

Building Trading Algorithm Machine learning is used in creating algorithms for trading decisions. Algorithmic trading, also called high-frequency trading, is the use of automated systems to identify true signals among the massive amounts of data that capture the underlying stock market dynamics. Machine learning provides powerful tools to extract patterns from the seemingly market trends. Here are companies using machine learning for building trading algorithm: KFL Capital: The predictions made by the company are the output of algorithms, predictive models and coding. The company employs machine learning algorithms to identify non-random price patterns in financial data.

      "text": "Harnessing AI to make DevOps more effective Q&A with Loom System CEO Gabby Menachem. \nMenachem: \"For the first two years we worked without any VC funding. We took in only revenue from customers.\" Picture: Loom Systems \nLoom Systems' AI-powered log analysis aims to give companies a warning when there may be a problem in their system by reading logs and detecting when something is likely to go wrong -- and then sends out alerts so DevOps and IT managers can respond before systems go down. \nZDNet talked to CEO Gabby Menachem about the company's future plans. \nZDNet: Tell me about the origins of Loom Systems. \nMenachem: We were founded two years ago and using our own money. We did this, rather than use venture capital funding, because we wanted to be closer to our customers. That way we could better understand the changing needs of companies in this data-driven industry. \nWe felt that having worked with big data platforms in the past, we have seen how all companies have been occupied with solving problems with data. \nFrom infrastructure to data analysis platforms to automated data science, at Loom we have been building all of these. And with all that experience, what we have come to realise is that, while companies should be able to continuously analyse big data, they are not succeeding in doing that. \nThat's because many of them find it just too hard. It's hard to have the right methodology, it's hard to analyse it, and it's hard to develop actual use cases. \nSo, understanding that, we broke it down into different stages of analysis and decided to build what we think is the world's first cognitive platform that can analyse the data for you. \nFor the first two years we worked without any VC funding. We took in only revenue from customers. We built up very quickly and in a very short time got up to 28 employees in offices in Tel Aviv and San Francisco. \nNow we are expanding our sales to the US and we have taken in our first VC money. We are growing quickly and now we have over 30 people, and intend to have 50 by the year-end. We now have customers of various sizes, up to some who are in the Fortune 500. \nAnd a big part of that is big data? Maybe I should start with a specific use case. \nWhere, at one time, you would have been talking to someone about what the problem was, now you are talking to a digital system instead. \nNow instead of talking to people, staff have to do their work on a system and, whatever the problem, they need to solve it in minutes, not the hours or days that they have been used to. what's hot on zdnet Trump administration demands data on over a million visitors to anti-Trump site \nThis new strain on IT, together with the fact that the digital medium itself has grown so fast -- and not forgetting that it is also a very big part of the revenue for all of these companies -- creates pressure. So IT operations has become another place where business needs to invest in order to lower the problems that they are seeing and to mitigate the churn that IT causes. \nIf IT is such a big part in this, how do you get that across to the people who work in IT? I think we are already having some success with that. Gartner recently praised us as a Cool Vendor of 2017 for expertise in performance analysis. That was because we were able to show that we could take the insights of a problem and create a crowdsourced solution that IT people and DevOps people could put on their usual schedule while continuing to contribute to IT and DevOps. \nHow does this work? The fact that every digital system today creates log messages is the basis of understanding how DevOps people solve issues within businesses. Whenever you have a problem, either you find out about it by yourself or through a customer. You then go into the system and you try to investigate by looking at the logs and trying to guess what went wrong. That usually entails using the methodology that you have. That is usually a person who is trying to find a word, or a structural anomaly in the logs, or specific messages that can tip you off on where the problem originated from. \nNow that causality problem -- how do you find the root cause of issues? -- is a big problem because you need to solve it in minutes. Now, when we looked at these problems we thought: 'What if we could build a system that could go through that process just as a human would but do it in an automated manner?'. \nNow you can just stream logs from all your systems into Loom Systems, and what it does, using AI, is look at all your logs and do this investigation on a continuous basis. So instead of investigating when something goes wrong, it investigates on an ongoing basis and if it finds something it alerts you. \nIt replaces the way you do monitoring so that, instead of investigating with metrics that you have pre-defined, now you have a system that surfaces interesting events that could be problems in your IT systems. And it does it without you needing to know how to define these problems. \nThat's the way to be on top of everything and it mitigates the risk that we talked about earlier. \nThe second thing is, after you understand this then you can reverse the process so that you are now proactive. Now whenever something happens in the system, you get alerted on it even though the customer doesn't know about it. Special Report Read More \nAre your systems applicable to any type of system or application? Our system is agnostic but we are seeing more and more customers in the financial industry along with telcos. I think that's probably because in the financial industry you are seeing a lot more innovation and early adopters of technology. \nAnd the telco industry specifically I think, because the margins there are now low so they are looking at a lot more efficiencies and ways to mitigate IT risk. I think that a technology like ours is not only managing to put a cap on the risk that they have, but is also giving them a better estimate for the customer. For example, if you have a problem with your cell phone, that's not something that customers take lightly these days so if you have issues, customers want them solved very quickly. \nWhere are you seeing the most interest? I think ecommerce is a growing space and in a lot of cases, where they used to be doing things that could be handled by a sole IT guy, they are now expanding and are becoming very large systems that are a big source of revenue. \nWe are also seeing a lot of manufacturing companies that want us to look at the logs from robots. Now, it is all based on secure assembly lines that are working faster than humans could, but it is also creating a big risk because if the line is not working, that hits your revenue. And all that is also working with our platforms. \nOur software is there to predict issues and fix them fast. But the pressure is on from companies because they are buying these robots and they need software to manage them but the software is not being built at the same pace as the ability to manufacture. \nSo where is DevOps in all of this? With these modern systems, efficiency of software is key and companies have been working on making software work more efficiently. DevOps has been important in the software world but now we are not only seeing it there but everywhere. \nHaving a good continuous development strategy and integration skills in manufacturing plants is something that companies (like GE for example who have been pushing it for a few years now) are taking into account in their vision for the future. \nBut can DevOps really be part of manufacturing? Where I see DevOps in the future is as part of a new methodology. Because software is moving so fast, you need a new way of doing operations. \nNow it is becoming so tied to the software that you need to incorporate the developer and we think that [line Of business] is the perfect solutions for that. \nWhere it used to be aimed at a specific solution, now, because the systems are so complex, just getting an understanding of how a business is performing can be hugely complex. So more and more people have to be put on looking at business data and DevOps data. \nNow in that sense, DevOps is still young. A lot of the early issues around DevOps have been solved but now you have new issues like, how to handle all this data and build actions on top of it. \nAnd this just returns us to the basic issue. It is all about the business, so you are not just doing DevOps because it's new and cool, you are building it into your systems because it can solve business problems. \nWhile it is doing that it is also building you a better service for your customers.

      "text": "Thoughts after taking the Deeplearning.ai courses Introduction: Between a full time job and a toddler at home, I spend my spare time learning about the ideas in cognitive science & AI. Once in a while a great paper/video/course comes out and you’re instantly hooked. Andrew Ng’s new deeplearning.ai course is like that Shane Carruth or Rajnikanth movie that one yearns for! Naturally, as soon as the course was released on coursera, I registered and spent the past 4 evenings binge watching the lectures, working through quizzes and programming assignments. DL practitioners and ML engineers typically spend most days working at an abstract Keras or TensorFlow level. But it’s nice to take a break once in a while to get down to the nuts and bolts of learning algorithms and actually do back-propagation by hand. It is both fun and incredibly useful ! What this course is about: Andrew Ng’s new ad venture is a bottom-up approach to teaching neural networks — powerful non-linearity learning algorithms, at a beginner-mid level. In classic Ng style, the course is delivered through a carefully chosen curriculum, neatly timed videos and precisely positioned information nuggets. Andrew picks up from where his classic ML course left off and introduces the idea of neural networks using a single neuron(logistic regression) and slowly adding complexity — more neurons and layers. By the end of the 4 weeks(course 1), a student is introduced to all the core ideas required to build a dense neural network such as cost/loss functions, learning iteratively using gradient descent and vectorized parallel python(numpy) implementations. Andrew patiently explains the requisite math and programming concepts in a carefully planned order and a well regulated pace suitable for learners who could be rusty in math/coding. Course material and tools: video lecture Lectures are delivered using presentation slides on which Andrew writes using digital pens. It felt like an effective way to get the listener to focus. I felt comfortable watching videos at 1.25x or 1.5x speed. quiz tool Quizzes are placed at the end of each lecture sections and are in the multiple choice question format. If you watch the videos once, you should be able to quickly answer all the quiz questions. You can attempt quizzes multiple times and the system is designed to keep your highest score. Jupyter notebook programming assignment Programming assignments are done via J upyter notebooks  — powerful browser based applications. Assignments have a nice guided sequential structure and you are not required to write more than 2–3 lines of code in each section. If you understand the concepts like vectorization intuitively, you can complete most programming sections with just 1 line of code! After the assignment is coded, it takes 1 button click to submit your code to the automated grading system which returns your score in a few minutes. Some assignments have time restrictions — say, three attempts in 8 hours etc. Jupyter notebooks are well designed and work without any issues. Instructions are precise and it feels like a polished product. Who is this course for: Anyone interested in understanding what neural networks are, how they work, how to build them and the tools available to bring your ideas to life. If your math is rusty, there is no need to worry — Andrew explains all the required calculus and provides derivatives at every occasion so that you can focus on building the network and concentrate on implementing your ideas in code. If your programming is rusty, there is a nice coding assignment to teach you numpy. But I recommend learning python first on codecademy . How this DL course is different from Jeremy Howard’s Fast.ai course: Let me explain this with an analogy: Assume you are trying to learn how to drive a car. Jeremy’s FAST.AI course puts you in the drivers seat from the get-go. He teaches you to move the steering wheel, press the brake, accelerator etc. Then he slowly explains more details about how the car works — why rotating the wheel makes the car turn, why pressing the brake pedal makes you slow down and stop etc. He keeps getting deeper into the inner workings of the car and by the end of the course, you know how the internal combustion engine works, how the fuel tank is designed etc. The goal of the course is to get you driving. You can choose to stop at any point after you can drive reasonably well — there is no need to learn how to build/repair the car. Andrew’s DL course does all of this, but in the complete opposite order . He teaches you about internal combustion engine first! He keeps adding layers of abstraction and by the end of the course you are driving like an F1 racer! The fast AI course mainly teaches you the art of driving while Andrew’s course primarily teaches you the engineering behind the car . How to approach this course: If you have not done any machine learning before this, don’t take this course first. The best starting point is Andrew’s original ML course on coursera . After you complete that course, please try to complete part-1 of Jeremy Howard’s excellent deep learning course . Jeremy teaches deep learning Top-Down which is essential for absolute beginners . Once you are comfortable creating deep neural networks, it makes sense to take this new deeplearning.ai course specialization which fills up any gaps in your understanding of the underlying details and concepts. Things I liked in this course: Facts are pretty much laid out bare — All uncertainties & ambiguities are periodically eliminated 2. Andrew stresses on the engineering aspects of deep learning and provides plenty of practical tips to save time and money — the third course in the DL specialization felt incredibly useful for my role as an architect leading engineering teams . 3. Jargon is handled well. Andrew explains that an empirical process = trial & error  — He is brutally honest about the reality of designing and training deep nets. At some point I felt he might have as well just called Deep Learning as glorified curve-fitting 4. Squashes all hype around DL and AI — Andrew makes restrained, careful comments about proliferation of AI hype in the mainstream media and by the end of the course it is pretty clear that DL is nothing like the terminator. 5.Wonderful boilerplate code that just works out of the box! 6. Excellent course structure. 7. Nice, consistent and useful notation. Andrew strives to establish a fresh nomenclature for neural nets and I feel he could be quite successful in this endeavor. 8. Style of teaching that is unique to Andrew and carries over from ML — I could feel the same excitement I felt in 2013 when I took his original ML course. 9.The interviews with deep learning heroes are refreshing — It is motivating and fun to hear personal stories and anecdotes. Things I found lacking: I wish that he’d said ‘ concretely ’ more often! Some additional things I learnt along the way: DL is not easy. It takes some hard work over time to “get” the concepts and make them work well. Andrew had written a quora answer a while ago that deeply resonated with me. 2. Good tools are important and will help you accelerate your learning pace. I bought a digital pen after seeing Andrew teach with one. It helped me work more efficiently. Black ink is Andrew’s and colors are mine 3. There is a psychological reason why I recommend the Fast.ai course before this one. Once you find your passion, you can learn uninhibited. 4. You just get that dopamine rush each time you score full points: hell yeah! 5. Don’t be scared by DL jargon ( hyperparameters = settings, architecture/topology=style etc. ) or the math symbols. If you take a leap of faith and pay attention to the lectures, Andrew shows why the symbols and notation are actually quite useful. They will soon become your tools of choice and you will wield them with style ! some scary looking symbols which will begin to make sense when you watch the lecture videos Closing comments(optional read): Everyone starts in this field as a beginner. If you are a complete newcomer to the DL field, it’s natural to feel intimidated by all the jargon and concepts. Please don’t give up. You probably were drawn to this field hoping to find your calling. Trust your gut and stay focused and you will be successful sooner than you realize! Even Andrew Ng had to learn linear algebra at some point in the past — he wasn’t born with that knowledge. While this is an incredible resource, this is not the only DL course in the world. Many generous teachers like Salman Khan , Jeremy Howard, Sebastian Thrun, Geoff Hinton have shared their knowledge online for free just like Andrew Ng. I wasn’t lucky enough to pursue a masters or PhD as I had to enter the workforce and support my family — But that didn’t mean the learning had to stop. I have had the opportunity to customize my own learning plan, thanks to the democratization of knowledge. And I could choose to learn from the people I admired most: Programming(Gerald Sussman), Linear Algebra(Gilbert Strang), AI(Marvin Minsky), Philosophy(Daniel Dennett), Psychology(Jean Piaget), Physics(Hans Bethe)… Most of applied DL is really disciplined engineering — And Prof. Ng provides a fantastic compilation in course-3( My favorite of the 3 courses released so far ). The mindset required for making DL work for your problems are no different than that required while approaching any other hard engineering problem. Everything you need to know has been documented clearly by Claude Shannon decades ago . Thanks for reading and best wishes! ",

      "title": "Obsessives Have Cracked the Perfect FICO Credit Score of 850 - Bloomberg",
      "text": "@WealthWatch More stories by Suzanne Woolley \nIt took Stan Kelman three years of monitoring and tinkering to muscle his wife’s credit score to a perfect 850. “It’s a personal achievement,” says the 44-year-old business analyst and data scientist. “I’m very proud of it.” \nAnna, his wife, let him direct the strategy for managing her accounts—whether to apply for new credit, when to ask for higher limits, how much of those limits to draw on. Her husband, a self-described credit card-obsessive, was also working on his own record. Six months ago, when some big credit blemishes finally dropped off his report, his score reached as high as 842. Within a year, Kelman thinks he can reach 850, too. \nSome 200 million U.S. consumers have FICO credit scores, while just under 3 million, or about 1.4 percent, have perfect 850s. That’s according to Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the 28-year-old scoring model used by lenders to predict whether you will pay back a loan. But over the years the number has become much more than that—it’s now an American totem of success or failure, hope or despair, security or risk. While there are competing models, almost anyone with a credit card knows that a number typically ranging between 300 and 850 holds huge sway over their financial life. Source: Stan Kelman \nOr does it? America may finally be approaching what could arguably be called peak credit score. This year, the average national FICO number is 700, just above where it stood in October 2006, before the run-up to our most recent financial collapse. The ranks of “super-prime” consumers—those with scores of 800 and up—have steadily increased since 2010, and now number over 41 million, more than consumers with scores of 600 or below. \nA big reason for this is that American consumer finances are generally in good shape. While the overall level of household debt has returned to its pre-recession peak, it remains low when compared with income, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Debt service—principal and interest payments as a percent of income—is at an all-time low, helped by mortgage refinancing over the past decade. \nIt used to be that your credit score was a big mystery, or you had to pay to see it. Now credit card companies can’t wait to show you your score, for free. But those three-digit numbers you get every month aren’t necessarily the ones lenders use. In reality, you have dozens of scores, some based on previous versions of FICO scoring models and others developed by the three big credit bureaus. And your score will vary by the lender’s industry—mortgage, auto loan, credit card, and telecom services. \nIt’s possible all this transparency has fueled our pursuit of creditworthiness. What has definitely helped is a steady decline in payment delinquencies of more than 90 days, especially in real estate loans. All those negative credit entries earned in the recession have also started to disappear from reports thanks to the seven-year rule that helped Kelman. Meanwhile, automated bill payments are removing human error from the equation. A lull in the growth of new subprime accounts from early 2012 to early 2014, and a lingering reluctance on the part of consumers to seek new credit hasn’t hurt, either. (Applying for more credit temporarily dings your score.) Illustration: Thomas Hunter \nTo be fair, some experts see U.S. credit consciousness as being at a post-recession inflection point. Rather than dodgy mortgage loans, however, these days the risk factor is subprime auto loans, where delinquencies have been rising for four years. \nWhile late credit card and mortgage payments are also starting to tick up, Zandi believes those measures “are simply returning to historical norms.” Looser underwriting and hard-hit consumers in energy patches like Texas and the Dakotas are driving some of that. But there’s a third possible explanation: The weakening predictive power of credit scores as consumers learn how to game the system. \n“The scoring models may not be telling us the same thing that they have historically, because people are so focused on their scores and working hard to get them up,” Zandi says. Those score-fluffing strategies are “mucking with their relationship to the underlying credit risk.” \nEthan Dornhelm, vice president for scores and analytics at FICO, said the company sees “ no evidence of score gaming.” Recent increases in credit card delinquencies is on the banks, he said, since more low-scoring consumers are obtaining credit as lenders “aggressively compete for new card volume.” \nWe know our credit score sets interest rates on what we borrow, sure. But many may not realize that it also affects what card offers you get, what deposit utilities require, what your insurance rate will be, whether you get that rental apartment, or what your installment plan is for a mobile phone. In our society, it’s a three-digit number that can open or shut doors. Not surprisingly, many hyper-competitive consumers obsess over it. And when Americans obsess over something, they start looking for an edge. Credit: Fair Isaac Corp. \n“We’ve all been raised using a grading and evaluation system from school through work,” says John Ulzheimer, a credit expert who has worked at FICO and Equifax Inc. “You want to do as good as possible, and as good as possible in the credit scoring world is 850.” The only number that may be more important is your cholesterol count, he says. \nThe quest for the perfect credit score is “part of our western competitive edge,” says Sarah Davies, senior vice president of analytics and research at VantageScore Solutions, which has a scoring model that competes with FICO. “Here’s a way not to keep up with the Joneses, but to get ahead.” \nYour credit score has become such a popular character-meter that there are dating services based on them. A 2015 academic study found that “quality in credit scores, measured at the time of relationship formation , are highly predictive of subsequent separations.” The research suggested “credit scores reveal an individual’s relationship skill and level of commitment .” As if you needed another reason to boost your score. \nMembers of the 850 Club can be broken into two groups. There are the super-knowledgeable tacticians trying to crack scoring algorithms, and the naturally prudent. Some are prepping for a loan. Others are just credit-score hobbyists. Paul Chua, 40, who works at San Carlos, Calif.-based Helix, a startup focused on personal genomics, is one of the tacticians. \nIt’s almost like a video game, he says, “where people are trying to get a good score.” \nChua learned about credit the hard way. He ruined his score by running up debt in college. He read up on how to fix it, went on internet forums, and eventually got his credit into good shape—then he landed a job at consumer credit firm Credit Karma. Even with all that effort, though, the big reason for his success was simple: He didn’t miss a payment for seven years. He also used at most 5 percent of his credit limit, since scores can be hurt by high “utilization rates.” \nChua had an 850 score for about two months, he says, but it dropped to the 800s because he applied for a few rewards cards. Trying to get multiple cards in a fairly short period is interpreted as a sign of potential financial trouble, but if you’re looking for a big-ticket item like a mortgage, scoring algorithms will assume you’re only trying to buy one house when several lenders check you out. \nSo let’s say you’re a good consumer, you’ve never paid late, never did anything credit rating agencies might consider naughty. Why do you only have an 810? Getting to the big leagues, let alone the magic 850, usually requires a little more effort. In some cases, it might even help to have screwed up your credit at some point. Illustration: Thomas Hunter \nAll those credit cards from college that initially hurt Chua, for example, helped him down the line. That’s because he never cut them up, creating a longer credit history and a higher average age across his accounts. Both of those numbers feed into the 15 percent or so of a FICO score based on the length of your credit history. A virtuous cycle develops when you have good credit, says Chua. More companies offer you credit, which raises your total credit limit, which means you can make bigger transactions but still use the same percentage of your total credit. \nChua used to work with Kelman, our FICO score-obsessed husband, whom he calls his “credit-card mentor.” Kelman was Credit Karma’s lead analyst in data sciences, able to crunch a huge pool of anonymous information. “I had access to the credit reports of millions of people, and you just correlate the variables,” says Kelman. \nKelman’s own credit saga is much more complicated than Chua’s, and involved a lot more gamesmanship. \nHis family had arrived in America from the former Soviet Union a year before he started college and got his first credit card. He was dumbfounded by the concept. He described the card as a potent symbol of capitalism, “a rectangular bundle of joy” that at the time seemed to signal a “crowning achievement.” For about 17 years, he had great credit. \nIt might have stayed that way had he not charged the cost of a move from New York to Silicon Valley. In 2010, he decided to default on four credit cards, plotting out a high-stakes strategy: He would stop paying his cards and then try to negotiate with issuers just before hitting 180 days of non-payment. Accounting rules require credit-card companies to write off bad debts at that point, and he figured they don’t like doing that. \nThrough perseverance, well-rehearsed tales of woe, and the unplugging of his land line to avoid collection calls, Kelman reached settlements averaging 30 cents for each dollar he owed. His credit score, however, fell below 600. \nHis rebuilding effort was assisted by his diligence in paying down student loans while keeping credit card companies at bay. It also helped that a few older cards survived (though his limits were cut dramatically), keeping his long credit history intact. \nGoing forward, Kelman charged very little on his cards, using less than 5 percent of his overall limit across cards and less than 30 percent on each one. He sometimes paid his balance more than once a month, disputed minor inconsistencies in reports, and asked issuers for higher limits. He rarely applied for new credit. \nAfter two years, he had a credit limit of $40,000 and a score in the low 700s. When the seven-year-old negative information fell off his report, his numbers jumped into the low 800s. By July 12, his FICO score was just 8 points short of perfect. \nWhile all this strategizing can pay off, the reality is that it’s a lot of effort. And what does a perfect 850 bring you? Very little that you couldn’t get with a lower score, it turns out. “There is no incremental value to having an 850 score over, say, a 760 or 780,” says Ulzheimer. \nCredit card expert Jason Steele contends that a stellar credit score did help him obtain an “ultra-low rate” of 2.875 percent on a 5-year adjustable rate mortgage. But that’s about it. \nTo get there, Steele didn’t apply for new credit in the three months before seeking the mortgage as he knew banks would be sensitive to any fresh applications. He also began paying off his card charges before the statement close date, since that’s when balances are reported to credit bureaus—a big deal since they’re considered long-term debt. He also charged less on his cards.There’s additional disappointment awaiting perfectionists who want an 850 in perpetuity: Credit scores fluctuate from month to month. Steele compares their obsession with the desire to keep a new Jeep or truck spotless. Good credit is meant to be used just like off-road vehicles are meant to get dirty.“You’re kind of missing the point,” he says of 850-worshippers. “The point is for you to use your great credit to apply for really high-end premium cards with excellent sign-up bonuses, and get the lowest possible rate for other loans.” \nHave personal finance questions or lessons to share?

      "text": "Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) \nOver the last few decades, almost every industry has been disrupted by new technologies, the ability to use data and predict behaviour, and creation of more viable alternatives. With every disruption, the outcomes become cheaper, faster or better. To prevent users from reverting to the previous state, either two out of these three have to happen, or the change has to be addictive. \nBanking and financial services are, by design, people-heavy industries because of the associated cost of failure. Since the stakes are high, the industry has relied on human judgment for decades, creating large financial institutions in the process. But to make it all faster, better and cheaper, technology is the perfect answer. \nDepending on who you ask, automation, software, user experience, design, digital and sometimes even data science are clubbed into technology. Let’s break down ‘technology’ into exclusive, yet exhaustive, components as we discuss the framework for a fin-tech organisation. \nIn fin-tech, technology spans three key areas: \nCheaper acquisitions: The first win in fin-tech is the ability to acquire customers digitally via a website, phone call, mobile application or aggregators. This dramatically reduces the need for an on-ground force, bringing down customer acquisition cost (CAC) significantly. Besides, it enhances distribution due to the rising penetration of 4G and smartphones. \nOnline application forms, paperless account opening, and Internet-only banks are all proof of this concept. Use of business-to-business partnerships, social media, and digital search platforms have resulted in up to 80% CAC reduction for many new-age enterprises. \nFaster processing: The next big break comes when you need to take action. Automation and low-latency communication have enabled information to flow faster than ever. Whether it is processing a payment across the issuer, acquirer and the scheme within milliseconds, or processing a loan application through real-time scoring, it is all possible now. The rise of API banking, and real-time access to CIBIL, Aadhaar, and other public and private data sources is boosting efficiency further. \nWhat took traditional banks over 3-4 days of processing can now be done in milliseconds with the correct and synchronised use of smart technological interfaces. \nBefore we go to the third reason, let me introduce the geek(ier) cousin of technology—data science. In order to make better decisions, they all need to work together. \nBetter intelligence: Human decisions are biased, subjective and not replicable or scalable as the sample size increases. The balance then shifts towards a more optimal man-machine allocation for solving a problem. Fraud-detection, credit-scoring, and default warning systems are all made possible by using data science to predict an event or identify an anomaly. \nIn the background, sophisticated data science applications are made possible by the availability of extreme computation capability (think distributed computing, super computers, IaaS) and technology to implement algorithms at scale (think Big data architecture, DevOps). The outcomes are mind-blowing. Not many have imagined data the way they can be decoded with the help of systematic data science techniques and intervention. \nBy itself, technology is not the answer to everything. It is an enabler and propeller, a golden thread that runs across the organisation to make it cheaper, faster and better. When combined with the right use case, a focused data strategy and a well-thought-through architecture, it can be a winner on many fronts. \nTo build a solid technology function, the three teams need to come together: product, which defines the need; engineering, which builds the software; and data science, which helps take the right decisions. \nTogether, these three teams can create path-breaking user experiences, enable quick decisions and reduce the risk of failure while making the unit economics work. Fin-tech companies across the world have adopted this framework to devise solutions, creating newer markets that the banking industry didn’t see for over two decades. \nAn alumnus of IIT Bombay and ISB Hyderabad, Abhishek Kothari is co-founder of Mumbai-based digital lending platform FlexiLoans. \nLike this blog?

      "text": "14 August 2017 shares \nOver the past few decades, the rise of IT services firms and digital startups, along with a wide spectrum of other entrepreneurial initiatives, have transformed India’s growth story. Governments and MNCs are actively engaging with India’s startups, and Indian educational universities and corporate leaders are also ramping up their innovation quotient. \nAs India completes 70 years of independence, this ‘startup nation’ narrative has become an integral part of aspirational India. We are at the aptly-described ‘70 not out’ phase, and the best is yet to come – though there is the proverbial dark side in terms of challenges to overcome. In this special edition of StoryBites, we present 70 quotes drawn from our stories this year, capturing India’s startup narrative.

      "text": "Big Data Learn these 3 languages now if you want to become a data scientist Demand for developers with data science skills continues to grow. Here's what you need to learn to break into a career in the field. By Alison DeNisco | August 14, 2017, 4:00 AM PST Google Plus \nLooking to expand your skills in the tech realm? Demand for developers with data science skills is currently \"very strong\" among businesses, according to Shu Wu, director of Indeed Prime , with \"tremendous growth\" over the last four years for data scientist job postings. \n\"Job outlook is strong and data science roles command a high average salary, but the competition is tough,\" Wu said. \"A data scientist that is an expert at examining data is great, but someone who can make data digestible for the entire organization is pinnacle.\" More about Big Data IT leader’s guide to big data security (Tech Pro Research) \nTechnology advances and the massive volumes of online data available are affecting every sector and have tremendous impacts on the economy, said Karen Panetta, IEEE fellow and dean of graduate engineering at Tufts University. This so-called \"data avalanche\" is not just about the sheer volume of data, but also the speed at which it changes and grows, and the diverse types of data available. \n\"Knowing how to use a spreadsheet and a traditional database will not suffice in the emerging Big Data revolution,\" Panetta said. \"Analyses need to be done in real-time, where decisions can be critical. Being able to simply know how to use the software tools is only part of this challenge. Understanding the data across disciplines, being able to communicate its meaning, and using statistics will be the differentiating factors from a traditional 'number cruncher.'\" \nSEE: How to build a successful data scientist career (free PDF) \nIn terms of learning a programming language that allows you to work with data, \"the standard across the board for any language is to find something and do it,\" said Forrester analyst Mike Facemire. \"The great thing about writing code is that doing it wrong is a great learning experience.\" Facemire recommends going to Github to see examples, and finding a data set that interests you and learning to analyze it. \nUltimately, it's more important to understand how to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller pieces than it is to know the language itself, Facemire said. \"At the end of the day it's just a way to interface with a computer,\" he said. \"The computer doesn't care which language you use, it cares more that you broke down your problem properly and solved it properly to get the proper outcome.\" \nSome educational institutions have created data science degree programs, including Northeastern University, Boston University, CUNY and Merrimack College. Some of these schools offer online courses, and lower-cost programs and seminars are available through the IEEE Computer Society, Panetta said. \nIf you want to pursue a career in data science, you should consider learning one of the following three languages. 1. R \nR is a language and framework used for data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis, Panetta said. \nThe language saw a large surge as data analysis and data science become more prevalent in the past couple years, Facemire said. It's popularity has since leveled off a bit, however. R has tooling that is built for data scientists, with extensions and plugins specifically for that purpose. \n\"It is essential when learning a language like R that individuals understand the fundamental mathematical skills,\" Panetta said. \"It would be disastrous if we just trusted the outputs of software without knowing what we were truly measuring and without understanding the data we were providing it as input.\" \nSEE: The 10 easiest programming languages to learn 2. Python \nPython is a general purpose language, which is already hardy, and includes tooling that can fit into environments that require visualizations that will appear in websites or on mobile, Facemire said. It is also more readable than R, he added. \n\"If you're at the point in my career when you're thinking, 'I want to be a data scientist—which language should I learn?' I would look at both R and Python and see which makes sense to you,\" Facemire said. \"Both are absolutely viable.\" Businesses usually don't prioritize one over the other in terms of required skills for data scientists, he added. 3. Java \nJava was recently ranked as one of the most favored and most versatile language to write in, according to a survey from WP Engine . It's another general-purpose programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It can be used to build virtually anything, particularly scalable, multithreaded platforms, and has a strong user base. \nJava is also an interpreted language—unlike C and C++, Java doesn't require as much lower-level understanding of the hardware, Panetta said. That makes it easier for those studying in disciplines beyond computer science and engineering to learn it. Java is also the most in-demand coding language in terms of tech job postings, according to Indeed. Image: iStockphoto/scyther5 Keep up to date on all of the latest trends in big data.

Cognistx employs seven locally and expects to add at least two posts in the next few months. Enlarge Cognistx’s team in the company’s new downtown headquarters space. From left, Sanjay… more “Downtown happens to be the one central location for everyone,” Chopra said. “The space is such that we can grow into it easily, and we’re in the same building as Kroll, a client of six months.” Cognistx also added an office in Winston-Salem, N.C.’s Innovation Quarter last year, where its user interface and user experience operations are based. It expects to employ 25 there by next April. The company’s technical leadership team is in Pittsburgh. That includes Chopra, Eric Nyberg and Florian Metze . Chopra is a repeat entrepreneur, adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former director of digital commerce at Giant Eagle Inc. Nyberg, a CMU computer science professor, had consulted with IBM on the Watson project, the supercomputer that won on “Jeopardy!” five years ago. Metze serves on the research faculty at CMU’s Language Technologies Institute in automatic speech recognition, multimedia processing, semantic computing, and user interfaces. Cognistx’s first product , an app enabling Monro to make extremely customized offers to clients, launched in May 2016. Patty Tascarella covers banking, finance and the legal industry.

      "text": "My first internship, and ultimately my first taste of “adulting,” is taking place this summer at Glassdoor, the fastest-growing job site i n t h e U . S. \nHave you ever walked into a building and felt instantly comfortable, like everyone in the room wants you to succeed and be your best self? But at the same time, the atmosphere isn’t overwhelmingly competitive — people here have their priorities straight. So far, they’ve reminded me that family is a priority over everything. That it’s important to take time to travel during my time in San Francisco, have fun with my friends and enjoy this great location. \nAt the floor by my feet, there is always a dog to pet — usually it’s Beanie, the Chihuahua, or Duke, the King Charles Cavalier. They say petting dogs relieves stress and I’d have to concur. Puppies playing at your feet makes for a light-hearted working environment. \n\nLuckily, at Glassdoor as long as you get your work done, they trust you to live and work in the ways that work for you. I find myself working outside overlooking the bay just about every time the sun is out and the wind speeds are low. My team does the same, and everyone feels comfortable bringing their most authentic selves to work. \n\nWe have a lot of fun here at Glassdoor, but it’s also a lot of work. It’s challenging and I’m learning a lot, which is the part of this internship that I’m most thankful for. But don’t just take my word for it — here’s what other Glassdoor interns have to say! \nOn Their Most Memorable Moment \n“Getting good feedback upon the completion of my first project. I’m glad that I was able to contribute in a meaningful way and it was really nice of everyone to appreciate the work.” — Shashank Gupta, Data Science Intern \n“Having the chance to go to the CEO’s house in Marin and talk about the future of Glassdoor around a fire over tacos.” — Shiraz Kazmi, Finance Analyst Intern \n\nOn Their Projects \n“Career Exploration Month. I organized workshops where teams in different departments could share their roles and career paths to the rest of the company. Ending the month with a ‘Career Opportunity Speed Networking’ event for all employees to increase collaboration and develop lasting relationships.” — Erin Davies, HR Intern \n“First, scaling parts of our product by finding more ways for users to engage. Second, to provide reporting analytics to derive insight from those product updates. And finally, to create a vision for the signed-in homepage.” — Kevin Tse, Product Manager Intern \n\nOn What Makes Glassdoor’s Internship Program Unique \n“The people at Glassdoor are great, which I think sets it apart. Everyone is genuinely nice, but also professional. On top of that, the projects I was able to work on as an intern were not only exciting, but also tailored to the skills I’m interested in building to direct me towards my professional development goals. I must thank my manager for that.” — Pablo Ruiz, Research Fellow in Labor Economics \n“My internship at Glassdoor has been unique because I feel like my work has had a direct impact on the decisions made by the teams with whom I work. I am also very happy to be surrounded by friendly dogs and friendlier people.” — Daniel Peterson, Data Science Intern \n“This is my second summer as an intern at Glassdoor, and I think something that makes this internship unique (and one of the main reasons I came back) is that interns here have both ownership over a project that is important to the company and we have great guidance from our managers and others to ensure we are learning a lot along the way.” — Mary Petzke, Sales Operation Analyst Intern \nAvailable Jobs at Glassdoor 4.0 \nSales Compensation Analyst Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 3 days ago 3d 4.0 \nSales Support Team Lead Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 3 days ago 3d 4.0 \nLead DevOps Engineer Glassdoor San Francisco, CA 2 days ago 2d 4.0 \nSenior Product Manager, Growth Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 3 days ago 3d 4.0 \nSenior Data Scientist, Machine Learning Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 24 hours ago 24h 4.0 \nLead Front End Engineer Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 11 hours ago 11h 4.0 \nSenior Associate, Sales Strategy & Operations Lead - Customer Success Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 2 days ago 2d 4.0 \nSenior Content & Community Associate - Community Care Glassdoor Green, OH 4 days ago 4d 4.0 \nSenior Android Engineer Glassdoor Mill Valley, CA 5 days ago 5d 4.0 \nAccount Executive Glassdoor Chicago, IL 6 days ago 6d See more jobs at Glassdoor ",

      "text": "Analytics \nIn an increasingly complicated operating environment, the global oil and gas industry struggles to optimize their asset portfolio. Producers combat severe challenges inherent to aging facilities in the context of pricing volatility. Change is the new constant, as the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry means that producers struggle to move out of a debilitating trough to a manageable peak. \nDuring the industry troughs when margins are squeezed, it is necessary for operators to focus on asset portfolio management. How do operators maintain asset integrity and deliver additional production in mature fields? The problem associated with production facilities can be diluted into a binary solution; either extend the lifecycle of or decommission an asset. \nDue to commodity price concerns and OPEC discord in tandem with increases in U.S. production, it is imperative to maximize production in mature fields while reducing Opex. The best practices for asset portfolio optimization are also the drivers to achieve such goals. \nThe industry is striving for optimal asset management by calling upon digital innovations in the field of data science and advanced technologies matured in other verticals. Advanced analytics can improve the methodologies used by geoscientists to perform monitoring and surveillance of all activities across oil fields. \nProducers need an analytic-infused asset performance management system as they evaluate the best options to addresses underperforming wells, reservoirs, and fields. As input variables change in a dynamic environment; an operator must leverage best practices to identify the impact of these changes proactively. Rapidly converting data to insight to action is the key to enhancing the portfolio. Coalescing all ideas and techniques to achieve the panacea that is asset portfolio optimization is a sustainable and scalable goal. \nAn asset performance management system for a global oil and gas company must address three primary business goals as represented by the three vertices illustrated in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Enterprise asset performance management methodologies \nThe three vertices represent the business value propositions that underpin an optimization suite of data-driven analytical workflows. The iterative cycle implements a continuous improvement of measurement and analysis, transforming raw data into actionable knowledge \nOutcomes of increased asset utilization: Improved reliability.

      "text": "Researchers discover new class of chemical reaction August 14, 2017 A chemical reaction where three different molecules (e.g. H, O2, H) each participate in the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. The reaction is mediated by an ephemeral collision complex (HO2**) formed from the collision of two molecules (H, O2) which then reacts upon colliding with a third molecule (H). Data from advanced computations reveal that reactions of this class, hypothesized nearly a century ago and then later assumed to be unimportant, are major chemical pathways. Credit: Michael P. Burke/Columbia Engineering \nA new study led by Michael P. Burke, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Columbia Engineering, has identified the significance of a new class of chemical reactions involving three molecules that each participate in the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. The reaction of three different molecules is enabled by an \"ephemeral collision complex,\" formed from the collision of two molecules, which lives long enough to collide with a third molecule. \nThis fourth class, which the researchers have named \"chemically termolecular reactions,\" was first hypothesized by Cyril Hinshelwood and Nikolay Semenov in their studies of chain reactions in the 1920s and 30s (they won the 1956 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work). For decades, researchers have considered these reactions unimportant—if they even occurred at all—and until now, no one has studied them. Burke, who explores a variety of problems at the interface between fundamental physical chemistry and practical engineering devices, decided to investigate these reactions after realizing that common combustion situations, such as those encountered in many engines, have sufficiently high fractions of highly reactive molecules known as free radicals to make these reactions possible. The new study is published today in Nature Chemistry . \n\"Combustion has always been a launching point for understanding all sorts of other chemical mechanisms,\" says Burke, who is also a member of the Data Science Institute. \"Potentially there could be innumerable reactions from this new class that impact how we model gas phase chemistry, from designing new types of engines to understanding the planetary chemistry responsible for cloud formations, climate change, evolution of pollutants, even perhaps the sequence of reactions that could impact the conditions for extraterrestrial life. Our discovery opens up a whole new world of possibilities.\" \nFor example, space vehicles experience very high temperatures and radical fractions in their descent back to Earth. Burke speculates that this fourth class of reactions could impact the heat flux to the vehicle, with significant implications for the design of thermal protection systems to keep astronauts and/or payloads safe when coming down to Earth. \nWorking with Stephen J. Klippenstein, (Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, Argonne National Laboratory), Burke used state-of-the-art computational methods, combining quantum chemical computations that simulate the breaking and forming of chemical bonds among reacting molecules with kinetic-transport computations that simulate the reactions and movements of bulk gases that governs performance of engineering devices. \n\"The power of these state-of-the-art computational methods,\" says Burke, \"is that they can provide a unique lens into harsh chemical environments ill-suited for experimental techniques for studying individual reaction dynamics. Our calculations are based on computational data produced from first principles: the Schrödinger equation, the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. Combining these data with other physics-based models enables us to directly pinpoint the impact of just a single reaction out of many, in a way that is very difficult to do in the lab.\" \nUsing theoretical methods, including those they developed for this study, the researchers showed that these chemically termolecular (i.e. three-molecule) reactions not only are major chemical pathways but also impact flame propagation speeds, a measure of overall fuel reactivity that governs the performance, stability, and efficiency of many modern engines. \nThe chemistry of many systems, including combustion and planetary atmospheres , is governed by complex chemical mechanisms, where the overall conversion from a set of initial reactants to a set of final products goes though many intermediate chemical molecules with many individual chemical reactions occurring on the molecular level. Our current understanding of the complex mechanisms of combustion and planetary atmospheres has been premised on the classes of reactions that are known to take place. Up to now, only three classes of reactions have been considered: Unimolecular reactions, where one reactant undergoes bond breaking and/or forming to yield different products Bimolecular reactions, where two reactants collide and then undergo bond breaking and/or forming to yield different products Termolecular association reactions, where two reactants collide to form a molecular complex with a new chemical bond between the two reactants and a third molecule, known as the bath gas, removes some of the internal kinetic energy of that molecule to stabilize it \nThe bath gas is usually considered an inert, or non-reactive, molecule that does not participate in any bond breaking or forming, but instead takes away some energy from the other molecular complex (which would have enough internal kinetic energy to decompose spontaneously if no energy were taken away). \nIf instead the molecular complex collides with a reactive molecule, then the third molecule can participate in the bond-breaking/forming process, yielding what Burke and Klippenstein call a \"chemically termolecular reaction\" product. \"In our paper, we showed the importance of reactions involving H + O2 complexes with other radical species, e.g. H + O2 + H, in combustion environments,\" he notes. \"However, given the fact that reactive molecules, like free radicals and molecular oxygen, are major constituents in combustion and certain planetary environments, there is significant potential for other chemically termolecular reactions to occur and to play a significant role in other environments.\" \nWilliam H. Green, professor of chemical engineering at MIT, says of the study, \"It has long been known that many gas phase association reactions have very low effective rates, because the initial energized adduct does not live long enough to be stabilized by collisional energy transfer, and just falls apart back to the reactants. This has led the field to think that these transitory adducts can be completely ignored. This article reveals that even if the unimolecular reactions of energized adducts are negligible, they can still participate in bimolecular reactions, with surprisingly important consequences.\" \nBurke plans next to generalize these theories and methods for calculating chemically termolecular reaction rates to allow similar calculations in higher pressure environments, where collisions among molecules are even more frequent, important to cutting-edge engine designs. He will also explore the implications of the finding for other reactions and chemical environments, such as those involved in pollutant formation and reduction or the chemistry of planetary atmospheres.",

      "title": "Parenting in the Age of Artificial Intelligence",
      "text": "IEEE survey looks at the impact the technology could have on today’s children Illustration: IEEE Illustration: IEEE Generation Alpha—those born between 2010 and 2025—will grow up in a world in which artificial intelligence is part of everyday life. Robots will read them bedtime stories, and autonomous cars will chauffer them around without a need to ever learn to drive.\nThose are some of the takeaways from “ Generation AI: A Study of Millennial Parents of Generation Alpha Kids ,” an IEEE survey conducted in June.\nSix hundred parents between the age of 20 and 36 with at least one child 7 years old or younger were asked how they thought AI technology would impact the lives of their Generation Alpha children. Here’s an overview of how AI likely will be used during each stage of a child’s life.\n\nYOUNGSTERS Infants and toddlers will have toys and other AI devices that will help raise them, according to the survey. Forty percent of parents surveyed said they’re likely to supplement or replace a human nanny with a robot. The Institute wrote about two robot nannies on display at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, held in Las Vegas. Kuri is a robot that can navigate around the home and can tell bedtime stories to kids. Digital assistant Aristotle automatically recognizes when a baby wakes up and soothes the child back to sleep with a lullaby.\n“Using built-in cameras as well as voice-recognition capabilities in AI toys can help parents raise their toddlers,” says IEEE Member Sukanya Mandal, a professor of data science at Dev Bhoomi Institute of Technology, in Mumbai.\nAnd instead of asking parents all their questions—“Why is the sky blue?”—children could turn to Amazon’s Echo, Apple’s Siri, or another robot to seek out such information.\n“A gadget or bot could easily replace a human in some specific kids’ activities and tasks,” says IEEE Senior Member Edson Prestes, who heads the theoretical informatics department at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil.\nHelping kids with their homework is another parental duty that AI is likely to do, according to the survey. AI tutors will enable more personalized learning for students. Nearly 75 percent of parents surveyed said they would consider using an AI tutor for their child.\nIEEE Member David Hanson has already developed such a helper: a miniature robotic Albert Einstein that uses AI to engage students in math and science through interactive games. The bot can answer questions about those subjects as well as banter about celebrities and food.\n\nADOLESCENTS Another responsibility that parents could eliminate is teaching their teenager how to drive. The study found that about 30 percent of parents would be less concerned with their child behind an AI-powered car than a regular one.\nWith self-driving cars, Generation Alpha teenagers might not even need to learn to drive. That could mean safer streets and fewer sleepless nights for worried parents. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people between age 15 and 29, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nADULTS Finding one’s ideal mate can be difficult, but dating apps using AI and machine learning could help make better matches, according to the survey. The new Dating.ai app gives us a glimpse into the technology’s potential. The app scours Bumble, Plenty of Fish, Tinder, and other dating sites using its facial-recognition software to find matches based on a user's physical preferences.\n“For future generations looking for love or friendship, AI-induced personal matchmaking will be the obvious choice,” says IEEE Senior Member Tom Coughlin, who chairs the IEEE public visibility committee . He is a digital storage analyst and a business and technology consultant.\n“AI will leverage data points such as specified qualities, interests, and preferences from various dating networks and social media platforms,” Coughlin says. “It will then cross-reference that information with a database of thousands, if not millions, of other seekers and push that information automatically to compatible parties.”\nAnd unlike many of today’s parents who juggle caring for their young children with looking after their own parents, Generation Alphas probably won’t have that responsibility. AI devices in the home are expected to support seniors’ physical, emotional, and mental health needs. The Institute recently featured several technologies that could help seniors live independently. In fact, two-thirds of survey respondents said they would prefer to rely on AI technologies, and not their children, to help them stay independent.\n“Socially assistive robots have the potential to deliver cognitive assistance, entertainment, and companionship,” says IEEE Member Antonio Espingardeiro, a robotics and information systems expert. He invented one of the first social assistive robots for elder care.\nCheck out the infographic and interactive timeline that the IEEE public visibility committee created based on the survey.\n",

IoT training: IoT certifications emerge to close IT/OT divide by Steve Zurier ZFeatures Leading tech companies offer educational curriculum that gives IT staffers the IoT training they need to work in connected environments. This Article Covers Share this item with your network: Related Content The Internet of Relevant Things –Aruba Networks \nFor the past three years, most of the training for IoT has focused on industrial verticals -- and for good reason. \nMichele Pelino, a principal analyst at Forrester Research serving infrastructure and operations professionals, said there's a tremendous need for IT and operational technology (OT) professionals to work more closely together. \n\"IT staff is traditionally concerned about scalability, security and how they are going to manage all these new connected devices and sensors,\" Pelino explained. \"At a healthcare facility, for example, the operations people are worried about getting patients through check-in and checkout. There's just a real need for the conversation between IT and OT to happen more.\" \nMany companies -- including Cisco, GE Digital and Microsoft -- are now offering IoT training courses and IoT certifications to bridge this gap and help people succeed in IT/OT convergence . Cisco's IoT certifications and trainings \nSudarshan Krishnamurthi , head of business strategy for Cisco's educational services, said Cisco teamed up with Rockwell Automation Inc. to offer an educational curriculum that includes training courses on how to use their joint industrial automation platform. \nThe Cisco Certified Network Associate Industrial IoT certification was introduced as a CCNA option in 2015. Krishnamurthi said the certification, which is geared toward manufacturing, process control, and oil and gas engineers, focuses on the IT side around security, data sciences and managing converged networks. \n\"We are not teaching them everything about IT, but one thing we do is get them to think about how to take all the connected devices and gather insights from the data so they can make better decisions to create better operational efficiencies and optimize business outcomes,\" Krishnamurthi explained. \"And on the other side, IT people need to understand that they are no longer just managing devices connected to the network; now, they are also managing the plant's LAN.\" \nCisco began by focusing on industrial verticals such as manufacturing with Rockwell Automation and has since branched into healthcare and retail. The company also plans to work with industry partners in the connected home area to develop an educational curriculum in the next several months. GE Digital: IoT training inside and out \nAt GE Digital, Ann Johnston, digital learning transformation leader, said she's had to refocus her approach to training following her four-year stint at GE Aviation. \nJohnston said in the industrial arena, once a part gets placed into production, the manufacturing of that product stays fairly consistent. In many ways, industry had a way of producing and training its staff that reflects methods that have evolved over 130 years. Now, industry has entered a new era in which software plays a larger role on the factory floor and requires a different approach. With software, Johnston said, the need for continuous improvement requires ongoing education in how to keep code quality high, develop securely and run automated tests. \n\"It's very different working on a machine with metal versus developing software,\" she said. \"Everything with software revolves around speed to market and continuous development.\" \nAnd continuous development takes continuous education. GE Digital meets this need by offering both internal and external training, including training in how to optimize GE's Predix platform . The more detailed technology, software development and analysis courses are geared for the 26,000 employees across GE Digital. \n\"In essence, we are offering the training horizontally across each of GE's major verticals,\" Johnston said. \"The idea is that every aspect of GE now has a digital component and we need to supply the training to support that. Implicit in all of this new training is that IoT is central to coursework -- all of this is geared for how software developed affects IoT environments.\" \nGE Digital also takes advantage of the staff's expertise. Johnston said she and her team figure that if even half of the 26,000 people they train are good teachers, the company now has access to thousands of subject-matter experts (SMEs) it can take advantage of. So, over the past few years, GE has been really bullish on the ability to scale peer-to-peer learning. \n\"We get SMEs to do tutorials on five- to eight-minute videos,\" Johnston said. \"The idea is that once one group has learned and mastered a new set of skills, they train the new people who come along next.\" Microsoft's IoT training courses \nMicrosoft also has an educational curriculum for IoT available on edX. Paul Pardi, principal content publishing manager, said Microsoft's upcoming IoT Professional Program will focus on software development, data science and DevOps. Many of the courses will also teach developers how to integrate IoT products into Microsoft Azure. \nPardi said courses will roll out one by one throughout 2017 and the full package that will lead to an IoT certification should be available by December. \n\"While our offerings can be consumed by the maker community and hobbyists, Microsoft's primary focus for training at this point will be for enterprise developers,\" Pardi said. \nCisco, GE Digital and Microsoft have clearly made IoT training a priority. What started off as some fledgling offerings a few years ago has blossomed into more robust training IoT certifications that should help industry develop the skilled workers it needs . \nHowever, Cushing Anderson, program vice president for business consulting and IT education at IDC, said though he supports efforts by these major companies to train people around IoT, he still takes a fairly skeptical view of such training. While it's important for people working in IoT environments to be highly skilled, he said he's not always sure they are unique skills. \n\"Many of the security and data analytics skills taught in the IoT courses are the same that people have been using for several years, they just have to be geared to IoT,\" he said. \"It's just that people are applying the same skills in a new way.\" \nAnderson has a point, at least when it comes to security and analytics skills. On the other hand, developers need specialized IoT training to learn how develop apps in Predix, and certainly the same case could be made for developing secure apps in an Azure environment. \nSo, whether it's a midcareer person who needs to revamp his skills or someone new to the industry, IoT certifications and opportunities to learn how to develop secure apps in connected environments are now available -- and more are on the way. IoT training courses \nThe following are links to courses that are now available, the vast majority of which are geared toward developers:",

      "title": "Data Lake Webinar Recap",
      "text": "by Nick Heudecker | August 14, 2017 | Submit a Comment \nLast Thursday I presented the webinar “From Pointless to Profitable: Using Data Lakes for Sustainable Analytics Innovation” to about 300 attendees. While we don’t consider webinar polling results valid data for research publication (too many concerns about survey sampling), webinar polls can offer some interesting directional insight. \nI asked the audience two questions. First, I asked what the data lake concept meant to them. There were some surprises: \nThe audience’s expectation for a data lake is as a platform to support self-service BI and analytics (36%), but also as a staging area for downstream analytics platforms (25%). It’s not unreasonable to combine these two together – the functionality for a data lake is largely the same in both cases. The users for each use case differ, as well as the tools, but it’s still the same data lake. A realistic approach is to think of these two use cases as a continuum. Self-service users first identify new or existing data sources that support a new result. Then, those data sources are processed, staged and moved to an optimized analytics platform. \nIt was reassuring to see smaller groups of respondents considering a data lake for a data warehouse replacement (9%) and as a single source for all operational and analytical workloads (15%). I expected these numbers to be higher based on overall market hype. \nThe second polling question asked what type of data lake audience members had implemented. Before I get into the results, I have to set some context. My colleague Svetlana Sicular identified three data lake architecture styles (see “ Three Architecture Styles for a Useful Data Lake “): Inflow lake: accommodates a collection of data ingested from many different sources that are disconnected outside the lake but can be used together by being colocated within a single place. Outflow lake: a landing area for freshly arrived data available for immediate access or via streaming. It employs schema-on-read for the downstream data interpretation and refinement. The outflow data lake is usually not the final destination for the data, but it may keep raw data long term to preserve the context for downstream data stores and applications. Data science lab: most suitable for data discovery and for developing new advanced analytics models — to increase the organization’s competitive advantage through new insights or innovation. \nWith that context in place, I asked the audience about their implementation: \n63% of respondents have yet implemented a data lake. That’s understandable. After all, they’re listening to a foundational webinar about the concept. The outflow lake was the most common architecture style (15%) and it’s also the type clients are asking about most frequently. Inflow and data science architectural styles tied at 11%. \nThe audience also asked some excellent questions. Many asked about securing and governing data lakes, a topic I’m hoping to address soon with Andrew White and Merv Adrian . Additional Resources",

      "text": "Svitlana Volkova is studying the relationship between emotions expressed on social media and public health. (PNNL Photo / Eric Francavilla) Imagine if public health workers could monitor social media to take the emotional temperature of a specific population and use that data to predict epidemics.\nResearchers from the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in Richland, Wash., had that scenario in mind when they conducted a new study to learn more about the correlation between emotions expressed on Twitter and flu outbreaks. Their findings were published in the journal EPJ Data Science. \nThey looked at 171 million tweets from users located near U.S. military bases in 25 domestic and six international locations. They studied tweets from military personnel and a control group of civilians. Then they compared the data to the number of visits to military health clinics for flu-like symptoms. The researchers wanted to find out if the opinions and emotions expressed could have any correlation to doctors’ visits for illnesses like the flu.\nThe study revealed that during periods of high clinic visits for flu-like symptoms, Twitter users expressed sadness or neutral sentiments more frequently. Periods of low clinic visits for flu-like symptoms correlated with Twitter users expressing more positive sentiments, anger, and surprise. One possible explanation is sick people have lower energy and that translates to less visceral, more neutral or melancholy tweets. But there is still more research to be done before the study’s authors draw those kinds of conclusions.\nResearchers chose to focus on populations around military bases as those “communities present a unique case study because they are semi-closed populations of people who share common location, responsibilities, and way of life. They actively use social media to stay connected with their unit at home or with friends and family when deployed.”\nSvitlana Volkova, a PNNL data scientist and lead author on the study, hopes that by studying the psychological state of Twitter users, public health officials will eventually be able to predict and track epidemics in real time.\nSome health workers already use technology, like Google Flu Trends, to track spikes in searches for specific, illness-related keywords. But Volkova’s research could unlock broader data sets by tracking the emotional state of a community, not just specific language.\n“Opinions and emotions are present in every tweet, regardless of whether the user is talking about their health,” she said in a statement. “Like a digital heartbeat, we’re finding how changes in this behavior relate to health trends in a community.”\nNow that the preliminary research is done, Volkova and her team will study whether the emotions identified in the study can be used to predict a change in health trends before it happens.\n“If this method works in real time,” PNNL says, “public health workers could look into the future by asking ‘How are your tweets feeling?'”",

      "text": "Instagram posts that reveal you have depression PHOTO: ISTOCKPHOTO http://str.sg/4KKJ Copy \nThe photos you share online speak volumes. They can serve as a form of self-expression or a record of travel. They can reflect your style and your quirks. \nBut they might convey even more than you realise - new research suggests that the photos you share may hold clues to your mental health. \nFrom the colours and faces in their photos to the enhancements they make before posting them, Instagram users with a history of depression seem to present the world differently from their peers, according to the study, published last week in the journal EPJ Data Science. \nDr Andrew Reece, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, and co-author of the study together with Professor Christopher Danforth from the University of Vermont, said: \"People in our sample who were depressed tended to post photos that, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, were bluer, darker and greyer on average than healthy people.\" Get The Straits Times Sign Up \nThe pair identified participants as \"depressed\" or \"healthy\", based on whether they reported having received a clinical diagnosis of depression in the past. \nThey used machine-learning tools to find patterns in the photos and to create a model predicting depression based on the posts. \nDARK, GREY WORLD \nPeople in our sample who were depressed tended to post photos that, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, were bluer, darker and greyer on average than healthy people. \nDR ANDREW REECE AND PROF CHRISTOPHER DANFORTH, co-authors of the study, on using machine-learning tools to find patterns in photos and to create a model predicting depression based on the posts. \nThey found that depressed participants used fewer Instagram filters, those which allow users to digitally alter brightness and colouring of a photo before it is posted. \nWhen these users did add a filter, they tended to choose \"Inkwell\", which drains a photo of its colour, making it black-and-white. \nThe healthier users tended to prefer \"Valencia\", which lightens the tint of a photo. \nDepressed participants were more likely to post photos containing a face. But when healthier participants did post photos with faces, theirs tended to feature more of themselves, on average. \nAs revealing as the findings are about Instagram posts specifically, both the study authors said that the results speak more to the promise of their techniques. \n\"This is only a few hundred people and they are pretty special,\" Prof Danforth said of the partici- pants. \"There's a sieve we put them through.\" \nParticipants had to meet several criteria. They had to be active and highly rated on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform, a paid crowdsourcing platform that researchers often use to find participants. \nThey also had to be active on Instagram and willing to share their entire posting history with the researchers. Finally, they had to share whether or not they had received a clinical diagnosis of depression. \nOut of the hundreds of responses they received, Dr Reece and Prof Danforth recruited a total of 166 people, 71 of whom had a history of depression. They collected nearly 44,000 photos in all. \nThe researchers then used software to analyse the hue, colour saturation and brightness of each photo, as well as the number of faces it contained. \nThey also collected information about the number of posts per user and the number of comments and likes on each post. \nUsing machine-learning tools, they found that the more comments a post received, the more likely it was to have been posted by a depressed participant. \nThe opposite was true for likes. \nThey also found that depressed users tended to post more frequently. \nThough the researchers warned that their findings may not apply to all Instagram users, they argued that the results suggest that a similar machine-learning model could in future prove useful in conducting or augmenting mental health screenings. \n\"We reveal a great deal about our behaviour with our activities,\" Prof Danforth said, \"and we're a lot more predictable than we'd like to think\". \nNYTIMES A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on August 15, 2017, with the headline 'Instagram posts that reveal you have depression'.

      "text": "Internet of Things 3 real-world examples of IoT rolled out in the enterprise Without network support, businesses may not be able to reap all the benefits of the data IoT generates. Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry What's next in IoT innovations? \nBuying into IoT comes with a wealth of benefits, but adopting heavy use of the internet of things means more than plugging in devices and waiting for the data to pour in; it means modifying network infrastructure to accommodate them. \nThis is not a trivial consideration. If the network doesn’t adequately support all aspects of IoT, a company may be unable to take advantage of all that data and will fail to realize the return on investment it was hoping for. \nEarly adopters of IoT can provide valuable lessons to other companies looking to roll out similar projects. Here are three examples of how companies are addressing various IoT networking issues. IoT Security and an IoT gateway at Rockwell Automation \nFor some companies, IoT is nothing new. Rockwell Automation, a provider of industrial automation technology, launched its first IoT effort in 2011, says Scott Sandler, technology manager, cloud computing. \nThe IoT initiative is intended to provide the appropriate technology to enable Rockwell’s customers to connect the industrial equipment and systems they use to the cloud, in order to better analyze their operational data and improve decision support for both operational technology and IT users. \nThe company hired Microsoft to ensure that it has a secure industrial IoT platform that scales to meet its customers’ needs, whether they are scaling up or down, and to facilitate the movement of data through the enterprise to enable a range of analytics and business processes. \n“Rockwell’s vision around IoT is really targeted towards [our] customers—how we can better enable their success and achieve specific outcomes,” Sandler says. \nRockwell’s IoT solutions have allowed its customers to monitor unmanned remote assets, predict equipment failure, avoid the cost of deploying traditional on-premises servers, and boost performance through reduced downtime and optimized processes. \nOne early consideration in terms of network infrastructure was data security, he adds. Rockwell’s early adopters were worried attackers would be able to reach into their manufacturing plants. To address these concerns, Rockwell made sure its IoT service used a gateway device that only connected to the cloud using outbound port 443 (https/TLS); the gateway is architected so that it only makes outbound calls and only receives updates from the cloud in a response to calls it has initiated. \nRockwell also adopted other security measures, such as a policy server that issues shared access tokens and certificates to gateway devices for authentication purposes, so its customers don’t need to make changes to their network or firewall settings, since \\port 443 is typically set by default to allow secure browser-based communications. \nOther than taking steps to ensure secure data and configuring proxies, the network changes the company has had to make to accommodate its IoT initiative have been “minimal,” Sandler says. \n“However, I would point out that Rockwell approached the concept of an IoT gateway from the perspective of being as low impact as possible.” \nThe company’s experience with industrial automation, and the fact that Rockwell makes many of the devices its gateways connect to, help ensure a seamless connection between its industrial equipment and the cloud, says Sandler. That’s not a claim every industrial manufacturer can make. \n“This is actually an area that deserves some critical attention,” he says. “Most of the industrial automation equipment in factories today has been in operation longer than the concept of IoT and the cloud. As a result, making additional connections to those devices and asking for data at arbitrary rates runs the risk of impacting the actual ability for those automation devices to perform their job of controlling the process.” \nOne suggestion Sandler has for preparing networks for IoT is to choose a solution partner that understands the company’s data sources. \n“Failure to do this could significantly impact the network between your gateway and control systems, and even impact the automation itself,” he says. \nIn addition, “make sure the security strategy of your gateway aligns with your company guidelines,” Sandler said. “Our strategy around the gateway only making outbound calls and only to specific secured endpoints is designed to limit the risk of an outside threat reaching into the plant. There are certainly other security considerations as well as other ways to handle them, [but] make sure the gateway is consistent with your overall network security strategy.” Iot devices need careful network configuration to insure bandwidth \nThoroughly testing IoT devices before they’re deployed is also a good idea, but this too makes unique demands on network infrastructure. \nMarist College is engaged in advanced research with a company that’s an incubator in the late stages of IoT product and service development (the college cannot identify the company due to a non-disclosure agreement). The technology collects bio-digital health information through wireless access directly from sensors worn by people at some level of health risk. \nThe sensors gather data such as body temperature, heart rate and other indicators of a person’s general health. Predictive algorithms compare any changes in these vital signs over time, and if any single vital sign or combination of signs change, that could indicate a decline in the person’s health. \nThe monitoring devices must persistently stream data using secure wireless protocols to remain constantly connected to monitoring systems and medical services. \n“Our data science researchers have the opportunity to use big data—billions of events—to develop and prove advanced predictive processes, utilize machine learning, track interventions, and watch the effect of different variables in real time,” says Bill Thirsk, vice president of IT and CIO at Marist. “It is a perfect environment to develop cognitive computing with impact.” \nThe diversity and manufacturing specifications of devices play a huge role in how Marist handles IoT devices from a networking standpoint. \n“Since they often have varying chip sets, use particular protocols or specific wireless bands, and even ignore security best practices at times, some leg work and testing is needed in order to properly develop the network for their support,” Thirsk says. \nMarist is working with devices using a Broadcom chip transmitting over Wi-Fi. The devices connect wirelessly using both EnGenious and Cisco broadcast nodes. Marist is using an on-premise server connected via a Netgear switch to collect, pre-process and encrypt the data. \nA Netgear router transmits the SSL-secured data over the Internet, which is then received through Marist’s Juniper SRX 3600 series firewall and A10 load balancer. Once the device data is received by the predictive analytics server, it’s modeled for use by analysts. \n“We have not had to modify our network physically, but we have had to re-engineer network configurations [to] ensure persistent and secure transmission on the client side,” Thirsk says. “We’ve found different devices using alternate protocols and channels, [and] devices that could only ‘open stream’ with no security.” \nHe also recommends testing and creating small pilots of various devices. \n“You will invariably be faced with supporting a plethora of devices that users and clients may try to connect to the network,” he warns. “You must have an idea of the bandwidth requirements created by smart devices, what sort of encryption they can or cannot support, and whether or not they are secure and can be updated as needed.” \nFor example, Marist has experimented with small groups of inexpensive devices, such as Raspberry Pi’s, to see how they would work on its systems with various USB-based network interface cards, wireless adapters, and Bluetooth adapters. The goal is to collect information on the amount of bandwidth the devices would need and how much interference they might generate. \nDevice registration is also important. “Our network team wrote their own portal page that integrates with identity services,” Thirsk says. Users “register” devices and only then are they placed into a control group that allows access. Devices can then be set to connect to the SSID Marist created. Separate VLANs might be required to segment classes of devices away from the protected networks that have different security requirements. \nDue to the lack of standardization on many devices, it might be difficult to identify them on the network if they do not have the ability to identify themselves, Thirsk says. \nRemember that once you achieve some level of success with IoT, prepare for an influx of connected devices, Thirsk says. “Build in device and group visibility so you can understand the status of things, maintain security, and continue to expand your device presence and value,” he says. IoT plus Wi-Fi can help track patients \nRolling out an IoT initiative at a single site is challenging enough; doing it across multiple locations at the same time requires even more testing and preparation. \nSchlegel Villages, an operator of 16 long-term care and retirement communities across Ontario, Canada, recently overhauled its entire network, using Aruba Gigabit wireless access points and IoT devices to provide point-of-care services and automated food services to residents. \nThe company is preparing its network to support the connection of objects such as security cameras, nurse call systems and HVAC systems. As part of the transition, Schlegel is migrating from a Novell eDirectory multi-location server setup to a Microsoft Active Directory environment in a single data center. \n“In the future we anticipate taking advantage of the Aruba access points’ GPS locating technology, whether to locate lost equipment or get a notification on a resident who has left the building,” says Chris Carde, director of information technologies for Schlegel. “That will assist in saving lives.” \nAs part of its network update, Schlegel is upgrading all its switches and Wi-Fi access points, replacing the old equipment with HPE 5130 switches and Aruba 300 series access points, mostly Aruba AP 315s. \n“By the end of the project we will have around 1,500 APs, 16 controllers, and 50 switches installed,” Carde says. “Internal speed means nothing if accessing the Internet is a bottleneck, so we are undergoing a large ISP upgrade from a basic business line to dedicated fiber of 150mbps up and down across all of our 16 sites, and 1000 mbps at our data center. The new infrastructure will allow us to support IoT with better care and services to our residents and administration staff.” \nDuring the transition, the company is also implementing new iPad-based clinical software, which requires reliable Wi-Fi connectivity and performance, Carde says. By the end of the project, the company will have deployed about 600 iPads. \nIn addition, the company is rolling out a multimedia product called Scala, which will display menus, news and weather on monitors throughout all of Schlegel’s locations. \nOrganizations looking to create an IoT strategy need to think long term in terms of what types of devices will need to be connected, Carde says. \n“Ensure your infrastructure is capable of growing with ease to accommodate your future needs,” he says. “There is nothing more frustrating than bottlenecking yourself with a new network infrastructure. Having a plan in place will speak volumes on your ability to design a robust and expandable network.” Join the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.

      "text": "10 projects competed in the worldwide judging 13 teams demo’d their projects at the NERD Science Fair Hack Your Mind \nWe tried something new this year at the One Week Hackathon @ NERD by focusing time and energy to hack our minds. After all, the Hackathon is all about our awesome employees exploring passions/interests, experimenting with new technology and learning new things. \nFor those who wanted to learn something new about Machine Learning, AI or Data Science, a quiet space was dedicated for them to spend time reviewing online courses on Engineering Academy, Learn Analytics Portal, Infopedia and Microsoft Virtual Academy. \nFor those that wanted to learn a new skill like 3D printing, soldering or laser cutting, we partnered with Artisan’s Asylum , a local non-profit, to offer 3 maker classes during the Hackathon. Changing the Definition of Hacking \nThe Microsoft One Week Hackathon is the company-wide, multi-day, multi-location event, powered by The Garage , that brings employees and interns from all over the company together to create, innovate, and hack on ideas that inspire them. It’s the largest private hackathon in the world. \nThe Hackathon continues to lead the way in: Evolving Microsoft’s culture and the way we work Inspiring employees and customers to achieve more Creating value \nHow do we do this? By changing the definition of hacking. When you think of hacking, you typically envision dudes in a room at 3:00 am chugging down Red Bull, working on a phone app. Hacking is that! But it is also so much more. \nHacking is anything that brings people together to work on ideas that inspire them. \nIt is Joanie, a software engineer who wants to improve build check-in times. It is Meixia, a sales manager who has a growth strategy idea to increase cloud adoption and consumption. It is Steve, a finance manager who has an idea for a social marketing campaign to get more Surface Books into the hands of college students. It is Jayashree, an IT support specialist who has an idea to use IoT and robotics to improve farming and farmers’ lives. All are welcome to hack, all ideas, all disciplines, all roles. \nHacking is about learning. \nLearn something new, experiment with a new technology, learn a new skill, meet someone new, fail big and learn something from it. If you are a C# developer and you want to learn Python, get on a hack project and experiment with it. If you want to know more about marketing, get on a marketing project or recruit a marketer to join your hack team. If you are from the Windows division and you want to know what it’s like to work in Office, get on a project with someone from Office. Take on a leadership role for a hack project that you wouldn’t normally get to do in your day job and learn from it. Learn how to solder, 3D print, or laser cut. Experiment with machine learning, AI or data science. \nWhen people bring their passions and talents together to work on an idea or learn something new, it’s amazing what they can accomplish. The One Week Hackathon brings Microsoft employees together to innovate, create, and learn by hacking. It is incredibly energizing. \nAll of that energy, passion and learning taken back into the workplace, that is how we are changing the culture, inspiring employees and customers, and creating value. \nCongratulations go out to all of the teams who had ideas and then turned those ideas into action. Whether it was creating something new, improving an existing process, or learning a new skill… this action, experimentation and learning was epic. Share on:",

      "title": "Solving a Clustering Problem Using the k-Means Algorithm With Oracle AI",
      "text": "In this article, I will solve a clustering problem with Oracle data mining.\nData science and machine learning are very popular today. But these subjects require extensive knowledge and application expertise. We can solve these problems with various products and software that have been developed by various companies. In Oracle, methods and algorithms for solving these problems are presented to users with the DBMS_DATA_MINING package.\nWith the DBMS_DATA_MINING package, we can create models such as clustering, classification, regression, anomaly detection, feature extraction, and association. We can interpret the efficiency with the models we create. The results we obtain from these models can be put into our business scenario.\nThe DBMS_DATA_MINING package does not come up by default on the Oracle database. For this reason, it's necessary to install this package first. You can set up your database Oracle Data Mining by following this link .\nWith the installation of the Oracle Data Mining package, three new dictionary tables are created:\nSELECT * FROM ALL_MINING_MODELS; SELECT * FROM ALL_MINING_MODEL_SETTINGS; SELECT * FROM ALL_MINING_MODEL_ATTRIBUTES;\nThe ALL_MINING_MODELS table contains information about all the models.\nThe ALL_MINING_MODELS_SETTINGS and ALL_MINING_MODELS_ATTRIBUTES tables contain parameters and specific details about these models.\nNow, let's prepare an easily understood data set to solve a sample clustering problem.\nCREATE TABLE KMEANSDATA ( INSTANCE NUMBER, X_AXIS NUMBER, Y_AXIS NUMBER ); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (1, 3, 5); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (2, 2, 1); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (3, 1, 1); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (4, 4, 3); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (5, 6, 1); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (6, 7, 5); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (7, 4, 4); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (8, 5, 6); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (9, 3, 8); INSERT INTO KMEANSDATA (INSTANCE, X_AXIS, Y_AXIS) VALUES (10, 5, 6); COMMIT;\nI created a simple dataset to understand the problem. My goal is to cluster the closest one in this data set with the k-Means algorithm.\nk-Means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms. It solves the well-known clustering problem. It's a simple way to classify a given dataset through a certain number of clusters.\nThe following links provide detailed descriptions of the k-Means algorithm.\nk-Means clustering algorithm\nOracle documentation on k-Means\nThere are 10 records in the dataset. I want to collect these records in three different clusters, so I will choose a k value of 3. First, I look at the default parameter settings of my algorithm.\nSELECT * FROM TABLE (DBMS_DATA_MINING.GET_DEFAULT_SETTINGS) WHERE setting_name LIKE 'KMNS%'OR setting_name like '%CLUS_NUM_CLUSTERS%';\nThe default k parameter ( CLUS_NUM_CLUSTERS ) of the algorithm is set to 10, as seen in the default settings. I am creating a new table to set this to 3 to solve my problem and updating the relevant parameters.\nCREATE TABLE kmeanssettings AS SELECT * FROM TABLE (DBMS_DATA_MINING.GET_DEFAULT_SETTINGS) WHERE setting_name LIKE 'KMNS%' OR setting_name like '%CLUS_NUM_CLUSTERS%'; UPDATE kmeanssettings SET setting_value = 3 WHERE setting_name = 'CLUS_NUM_CLUSTERS'; UPDATE kmeanssettings SET setting_value = 10 WHERE setting_name = 'KMNS_ITERATIONS'; COMMIT; SELECT * FROM kmeanssettings;\nI have updated the relevant parameters as shown. Now, I will create my model using these settings:\nBEGIN DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL ( model_name => 'K_MEANNS_MODEL', mining_function => DBMS_DATA_MINING.CLUSTERING, data_table_name => 'KMEANSDATA', case_id_column_name => 'INSTANCE', target_column_name => NULL, settings_table_name => 'KMEANSSETTINGS'); END;\nOur code runs and we have created our model according to the current settings. Now, let's take this model data set and examine the clustering results:\nBEGIN DBMS_DATA_MINING.APPLY (model_name => 'K_MEANNS_MODEL', data_table_name => 'KMEANSDATA', case_id_column_name => 'INSTANCE', result_table_name => 'KMEANS_RESULT'); END;\nNow, let's examine the table:\nSELECT * FROM KMEANS_RESULT;\nWhen we look at the result set, we see a total of 30 records. For this reason, we had 10 records in our total data set, and we gave the algorithm the number of clusters. In this case, the probability of each record separately for each set in the output of the algorithm is calculated (3X10 = 30). To see the exact result, find the maximum probability record of each element and list it.\nSELECT t1.instance, t1.CLUSTER_ID, t1.probability, t2.x_axis, t2.y_axis FROM (SELECT INSTANCE, CLUSTER_ID, PROBABILITY FROM (SELECT T.*, MAX (PROBABILITY) OVER (PARTITION BY INSTANCE ORDER BY PROBABILITY DESC) MAXP FROM KMEANS_RESULT T) WHERE MAXP = PROBABILITY) t1, KMEANSDATA t2 WHERE t1.instance = t2.instance order by cluster_id;\nWe see that our data set is distributed to three different clusters. Finally, let's look at the last situation on the chart.\nAs can be understood from the graph, our model is logically clustered according to the k-Means algorithm.",

      "text": "Analytics | Work & Life at SAS Veterans possess traits that can enrich any organization. There are many opportunities for companies to help them re-enter civilian life, and tap into their talent. \nVeterans transitioning back to civilian life face a number of challenges , many of which involve working in a non-military environment. The Honor Foundation helps Navy SEALs and other current and transitioning members of the U.S. Special Operations community enter civilian life. Last week, a group of former special operators visited several employers in North Carolina’s Triangle area, including SAS, to learn about the skills needed to land jobs in the civilian world. \nIn addition to learning best practices in interviewing, resumes and job hunting tips, the group learned about the lucrative careers available in analytics and data science. Many of the skills valued in the knowledge economy, such as teamwork, creative problem-solving, strategic thinking and hard work, are ingrained in these military elite. \nAs Kevin McLaughlin, Policy Director, SAS US Government Practice, says in this segment from Raleigh NBC affiliate WRAL, “What company wouldn’t want to add that to their team?” \nKevin’s right, and if a company is interested in hosting, mentoring, hiring or donating, they should visit the Honor Foundation website and sign up today. Also, check out this powerful testimony from a recent Honor Foundation fellow. Many opportunities for companies to recruit and hire veterans \nAs a company committed to supporting veterans, SAS is fortunate to be based in North Carolina. With 130,000 active and reserve military located here, North Carolina trails only California and Texas in that regard. SAS participates in many programs to attract these dedicated, driven people to the company, and to help them make the transition to civilian life. \nThese efforts helped earn SAS the Pro Patria Award, the highest state-level award given to a civilian employer by the US Department of Defense. It recognizes companies for hiring and supporting veterans, reservists and members of the National Guard. \nHere are some of the programs in which SAS is proud to participate, which may spark ideas for other organizations. And we’d love to hear about what other companies are doing. The company’s signature internship program, VETS (Veteran Employment, Training and Support), which provides valuable work experience for military personnel pursuing a degree in IT. Participants work on business-critical projects, partnered with a mentor in the IT organization who is also a veteran, to help them acclimate to the corporate world while experiencing practical career coaching. An IT Awareness Day sponsored by Cisco Systems and the North Carolina for Military Employment invited transitioning servicemen and women to explore the diverse roles in information technology, from tech support to network engineering, project management to software developing. SAS veteran employees shared their stories at two military bases, and provided advice to those transitioning vets on how they can navigate a future in IT. The Veteran Career Transition Day matches local companies looking to hire service men and women with those looking for job opportunities. More than 120 transitioning service men and women who are currently seeking employment attended this year’s event. The North Carolina Veterans Enablement Consortium meets quarterly to share best practices and supports career fairs, mentoring opportunities and charity events for veterans. Military job fairs are an opportunity for HR staff to connect with military professionals on their own turf to help them explore potential career paths. SAS participates in a Mentoring Day with Enable America, which assists wounded warriors and disabled veterans in their transition to civilian society. Participants explore potential career paths, evaluate personal goals and participate in training sessions that strengthen their skills and prepare them for employment. At a Camp Lejeune Job Seekers Workshop with Enable America, SAS and other panelists advised vets on how to look for jobs in today’s world, how to write resumes and what jobs are available in different industries. SAS works closely with the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security’s local employment office and its veteran employment representatives to ensure they know the skills SAS seeks, and the company’s current job openings. SAS also conducts resume reviews with the department’s clients and presents information regarding the company’s application process. As a sponsor of the North Carolina Women Veterans Summit and Expo, SAS worked closely with the NC Division of Military and Veteran Affairs to bring education and resources to women veterans from across the state. SAS sponsored and provided instruction for the Wake Tech Vet2CEO program which provides eight weeks of business instruction to veterans pursuing entrepreneurship. The NC VetBiz Procurement Summit convened the US Small Business Association, NC Military Business Center, Small Business Technology Center and NC Veterans Business Association to provide business resources and access to procurement opportunities to veteran business owners. \nWhether it’s the Honor Foundation or another organization, there are countless ways to support our veterans as they move into civilian life. We welcome new ideas and stories in the comments.",

InCred's affordable housing loans seek to provide financing to customers living in smaller towns and cities, and the average ticket size is Rs 10 lakh, with interest rates in the range of 11-13 per cent. \n\nInCred's Education loan business is designed for customers going overseas for a masters' degree. \n\nAnshu Jain, Manipal Group's managing director Ranjan Pai and Dalmia, founder of Landmark Holdings have backed the nonbanking finance company with strategic investments. \n\nTwo weeks ago, ET reported that InCred is in the race to acquire a controlling stake in the Keralabased Catholic Syrian Bank.

      "title": "Swiggy hungry for more as it eyes bigger bite of India's food-tech pie",
      "text": "Name of the company: Swiggy \nLaunch date: August 2014 \nFounding team: Sriharsha Majety , Nandan Reddy & Rahul Jaimini \nLocation: Bangalore \nFunding raised in 2017: $80 million \nOverall funding raised since starting up: $155 million \nIndustry it operates in: Food-tech \n\nFrom the sight of a waiter walking up to the table with a tray of food, to hearing a delivery bike come to a screeching halt in the driveway, our culinary experience has altered with time. While it may be a stretch to say that full-service restaurants should simmer down, the course of bringing food to customers - instead of the other way round - is getting increasingly popular. \n\nBubbling to the surface of the list of food-tech startups that continue to scale up and sustain is Bangalore-based Swiggy. Grilled, roasted as well as relished during its three-year run, there is no contending the fact that the food-delivery startup has whipped up a recipe few in the market has been able to replicate accurately. \n\nSample this \nLaunched in August 2014 in a pint-sized apartment in South Bangalore, BITS Pilani batchmates Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy clubbed together with IIT-KGP alumnus Rahul Jaimini to open a one-stop shop for consumers' food needs. \n\nHaving partnered with a wide spectrum of restaurants - be it upscale chains or pocket-friendly joints - Swiggy's inhouse delivery fleet picks up orders (made through its platform) and delivers them to customers. Although the company partly outsourced this to a third-party delivery firm Shadowfax during its first year of operations, it now claims to have complete control over logistics, thereby getting a better grip on customer experience. \n\n\"Having our own fleet gives us the flexibility to offer customers a no minimum order policy,\" the company states on its website. \"Our delivery personnel carries only one order at a time, ensuring fast and reliable deliveries,\" it adds. \n\nThis fleet - presumed to be 13,000-membered - is the largest for any food-tech company in India, as per a recent company blog post by CEO and co-founder Majety. They reportedly undergo stringent background checks by tech-enabled digital verification solution provider BetterPlace before being on-boarded. To further bolster operations and ensure that the quality of service remains consistent, Swiggy had also partnered with Mumbai's ubiquitous dabbawalas to train its fleet on improving efficiency. \n\nHaving cinched deals with 12,000 restaurant partners across eight locations in India, the startup is looking to keep up order volumes, which currently stands at up to 6 repeat orders per customer per month, according to VP Marketing at Swiggy, Srivats TS. \"This is twice as much as any other competitor in the space today,\" he had said in an earlier interview. But, how did a three-year-old company make such rapid strides in a market where scores of other have tried, tested and failed with their offering? \n\nTaking a massive swig \nConsumer data - interspersed with technology - has enabled Swiggy to develop its own analytic capacity to ensure that its delivery estimates are spot-on. Any order that has successfully gone through on the platform takes into account a slew of components, including meal preparation time, road traffic as well as weather status, before estimating the final delivery time. Designing the app to minimize interactions between delivery executives and customers is another way of ensuring fast and timely deliveries. \n\nAccording to the startup, on an average this number stands at 35-37 minutes on days free of inclement weather and traditional festivals. Greater proliferation of data also helps it understand online consumption patterns better and conduct customer segmentation, creating a positive impact on operating success. \n\nFor instance, based on Swiggy's order analysis for the last six months, it was found that women are 25% more likely to order chocolate items online. In fact, the study found that 60% of the top orders for dessert on the platform are chocolate-based. Another study, conducted at the end of 2016, was able to determine the favourite cuisine or choice of food in different cities across India. \n\nBy scaling up their data usage, Swiggy has been able to add relevant features to further enhance user experience on its app. This includes a delectable interface that enables easy category switch, live tracking orders, recommendations based on personal preferences, and location-wise offers. Rolled out to users across Android and iOS platforms, they can now discover restaurants more easily and place orders faster. \n\nGobbling up the market \nComplex economics of the food-tech business has seen the number of startups which got investment drop to 16 from 20 in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year, according to data from Traxcn . However, although investments have been cut across the board, the quantum of funding received by these 16 companies has been significantly larger than those raised by the 20 in 2016. \n\nWhat stands out though is that funding raised by food-tech startups during the first half of 2016 is nearly as much as what a single company got in 2017. \n\nWith a critical Series E funding round that was announced in May, Swiggy got a whopping $80 million on its platter. Clubbed together with the $5 million venture debt it raised in January 2017, it is almost level with the $85.1 million raised by 20 startups collectively in H1 2016. \n\nThis takes Swiggy's total funding amount to $155.9 million in seven rounds, as per Traxcn data. With a clear focus on sustainability and profitability, the Naspers-backed startup plans to double its engineering headcount to 200 by next year and introduce more products and services. \n\n\"We have a fully scaled technology platform, but will look at growing our data science and machine learning capabilities as well,\" said Majety in an earlier interaction with ET. \n\nIt has also started cloud kitchens whereby they are collaborating with popular restaurants to offer them access to localities where they do not have a physical presence, but may have potential customers. With an additional control over the quality of food, Swiggy's Bowl Company is the latest tool employed by the startup to scale effectively. \n\nWith 30% revenue per order (which includes the commission on the price of the order charged from restaurants as well as the delivery fee charged from customers), cloud kitchens will further offer Swiggy better margins. It will also boost the number of times a consumer can use Swiggy over the long term, as stated in Majety's blog, turning the table on this traditionally high-volume and low-margin business. \n\n\"If we introduce brands that do not boost repeats, but just order numbers, we don't believe there's a case for that brand to exist and come back to the drawing board. (Having said that) we do not intend to create properties that compete with existing restaurants...(and only seek to) fix geographic cuisine gaps by closely working with our restaurant partners by helping them setup kitchens,\" he had further stated. \n\nTasting success \nAccording to the said blog post penned by Majety, daily transactions - or orders per day - has nearly doubled from 42,480 in June 2016 to 78,417 in just six months. With a steady monthly growth, Swiggy is reportedly at the cusp of reaching a run rate of 4 million orders per month. In fact, the startup boasted of clocking an average of 1,20,000 orders per day all through a week in July. \n\n\n\nLittle wonder that Swiggy will be crowned startup of the year at the third edition of ET Startup Awards this week. A recent Linkedin report had also named the startup as one of the top companies to work for in India, joining the league of homegrown e-commerce unicorn Flipkart. Furthermore, co-founders Reddy and Jaimini were also featured in Forbes India's 30 Under 30 achievers' list earlier this year. \n\nAlthough scaling back operations and shutdowns are not uncommon in food-tech as in any other industry, the entry of companies like Uber and Google in this space will continue to add more sauce to existing competition.",

Two new federal grants will bring another $3.5 million in research funding to the University at Buffalo’s Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. The first is aimed at better understanding data. The $2.5 million, five-year grant from the National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health will provide biomedical informatics training to up to 15 doctoral or postdoctoral researchers. The program will be directed by Peter Elkin , chairman of the department of biomedical informatics and director of the informatics core of UB’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute. The T15 funding will flow through UB’s Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Researchers will gain the ability to better analyze and interpret data for use in developing personalized medicine, tracking epidemics and gaining new insight into side effects of drugs. UB’s program will focus on three major areas: clinical informatics, including socio-technical and human-centered design, workflow analysis and cybersecurity; translational bioinformatics, including database management, pharmacogenomics and predictive modeling; and clinical research informatics, including a big data science training program, statistical machine learning and data mining. A separate $1 million grant was awarded to Umesh Sharma , an assistant professor in the department of medicine researching a protein involved in heart failure. The five-year NIH grant comes through the K08 program, established to help promising young physician-scientists develop into independent investigators and to help fill academic faculty gaps in certain fields. The program builds on the NIH’s KL2 Mentored Career Development Award, which UB received in 2015 along with the Clinical and Translational Science Award. Sharma also works as a physician with UBMD Internal Medicine and as a scholar in the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) mentored career development program. His research is focused on finding a way to block protein to inhibit inflammation, reduce fibrosis and preserve cardiac function. Sharma works with mentor John Canty Jr ., SUNY distinguished professor of medicine, chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine and deputy director of the CTSI.

      "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. Adecco USA recently partnered with Aberdeen on a second annual C-Suite survey and released the findings in a report, titled Best-in-Class Workforce Management Insights . Acknowledging today's candidate-driven market, the report uncovers how employers are experimenting with ways to attract and keep skilled workers, with C-Suite considering pay the most important factor.\nMore than 500 executives across the US participated in the survey, which aimed to gather insights on their workforce management efforts, identifying their challenges, best practices and future plans. Aberdeen distinguished Best-in-Class employers based on key performance indicators, including the rate at which new hires reach full productivity, optimal employee tenure versus actual employee tenure and employee compensation in comparison to the market average.\nBased on the data, Adecco's Best-in-Class Workforce Management Insights report sheds light on what employers are prioritizing in order to attract and retain top talent in today's competitive hiring landscape. Key findings include:\n77 percent of executives believe pay is the most important factor to employees. More than half of respondents offer health insurance and 401(k) packages to salaried employees, and 40 percent say they now also offer \"softer\" benefits, like flexible schedules. 47 percent of employers do not prioritize hard or soft skills over the other when vetting a job candidate, and they weigh a candidate's happiness as early as the interviewing phase. Less than half of employers are offering education courses to their employees, but 61 percent believe mentorships are of importance in determining employee happiness. \"In this candidate-driven market, the burden is on employers to offer compelling reasons for candidates to join and remain with their organizations. Right now, part of the conversation is centering around wages,\" said Joyce Russell , president, Adecco USA . \"While fair pay is a key driver in securing today's workforce, employers must also make predictions and be nimble in adopting new solutions as the meaning of 'Best-in-Class' continues to evolve,\" Russell added.\nTo learn more about Best-in-Class Workforce Management Insights, please visit: http://adec.co/work-force-management-insights\nAbout Adecco USA\nWhen we talk about us, we're really talking about our people—the best staffing and recruiting experts on the planet.

      "title": "Ordinary people are doing vital wildlife work. How? Counting hedgehog homes | Hugh Warwick | Opinion | The Guardian",
      "text": "Tuesday 15 August 2017 14.54 BST Last modified on Wednesday 16 August 2017 10.48 BST \nT oday sees the launch of the “ hedgehog housing census ”. All over the country, thousands of people are going to the trouble and expense of building or buying hedgehog homes. We want to know how important this is to the lives of one of our most loved animals – and how we can improve the way we help hedgehogs in the future. \nFor a hedgehog scientist – and believe me, there are such things – gathering the volume of information required to make this a meaningful study cannot be done alone. They would need to get into thousands of gardens, assess the structures, what they are made of, where they are situated. They would also need to see what other features the garden had that might encourage hedgehogs, such as access. One of the key messages from our Hedgehog Street campaign is the necessity to make small holes, around the size of a CD case, at the bottom of fences and walls to allow the animals to roam. Science is seen as something only specialists can do, but this idea is being challenged. This census is not the first \nSo how do we get the information? How do we find out what style of house works best? Well, we do that by recognising the real capacity members of the public have to provide valuable data. Science is seen by many as something that only specialists can do, but this idea is being challenged with many “citizen science” projects. This housing census is not the first. \nHedgehog research lends itself very well to citizen science. The animal is impossible to confuse with any other species, people love them, and they share our gardens. Add to this the very real problem of dramatic population decline – down by about a third in urban areas and more than half in rural areas since the turn of the century – and we have motivation to act. \nWe started using citizen scientists for hedgehogs over 10 years ago, when the British Hedgehog Preservation Society joined forces with the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and recruited more than 20,000 people to take part in our “hogwatch” survey. PTES runs Living with Mammals – a survey of urban wildlife that provides clear evidence of hedgehog population decline. They also run Mammals on Roads – surveying rural areas through the rather gruesome count of road casualties. Again, this shows that hedgehogs are being squashed less frequently, not because they are getting faster or more clever, but because there are less of them. \nThe contributions of thousands of people are vital to increasing our understanding of what is happening. And it is not just hedgehogs that benefit from members of the public becoming engaged in research; ornithologists got there long before us. Our understanding of the lives of birds has been transformed by the small unique rings applied to the legs of individuals through the work coordinated by the British Trust for Ornithology . Most of the people trained to do this are not “scientists” – but are part of the largest research department we have in the University of Life. \nThe empowerment that comes with being involved in these research projects is tangible. The first step might be small, such as marking a sighting on the Big Hedgehog Map , but it is a gateway to a deeper connection with our wider environment. We love little critters when the real world gets too wild | Liam Williams Read more \nThis step is also a way into the virtuous circle that citizen science creates. Engagement with research generates data that improves our ability to guide people into taking action to help hedgehogs. Seeing the return of hedgehogs to a garden is such a thrill, and will encourage more attention to be paid to the research, generating more data and refining our advice. \nOnce you have seen how important your contribution can be to hedgehogs, you should have the confidence to look wider. We can all make a difference if we get engaged. So start now. Join the hedgehog housing census, help hedgehogs and maybe surprise yourself with where the journey takes you. \n• Hugh Warwick is a writer and ecologist Topics ",

      "text": "Four jobs artificial intelligence (AI) won’t destroy Brought to you by Four jobs AI won’t destroy 12:20 14 August 2017 • 12:15pm \nG iven the trajectory that artificial intelligence is on, machines will soon do everything that people do today. In a world of increasingly powerful technology, which in aggregate will make the world a better, richer place but at the micro, personal level will make a lot of skills less relevant and less valuable, it is smart to try to figure out how to “beat the bot”. These are four areas and skills that are “AI-proof” – well, at least for a little while… Data science \nAccording to the job website CareerCast, data science is the toughest job to fill in 2017. That is because all sort of businesses – banks, airlines and manufacturers, not just technology companies – know they need to run their operations based on data (rather than guesswork) and are scrambling to hire the talent. \nYou do not have to be a maths savant to be a data scientist. The biggest trend this year is the growth of the “citizen” data scientist. Get started by working with software from Tableau or Qlik. Cybersecurity \nAaron Levie, chief executive of cloud storage vendor Box, recently said: “If you want a job for the next few years, work in technology. If you want a job for life, work in cybersecurity.” \nThe battle between “black hats” and “white hats” gets more and more intense each year as the modern-day equivalents of Willie Sutton, a notorious US career bank robber in the 20th century, go where the money is – ie, hacking code. \nKeeping 16-year-old Ukrainians and state-sponsored operatives at bay is a task without end. You might not be able to talk about your work but your bank balance will know. Design \nApple’s design sensibility – beautiful objects, beautiful online and retail experiences – has changed the face of modern business. Now every company and organisation knows it needs to upgrade its customer-facing game to stay in tune with changing demographics and changing times. \nDesign, once an afterthought when engineers and accountants had done the real work, is front and centre in every critical decision businesses are making. Consequently, design companies are being acquired right, left, and centre by big consulting and technology firms. \nIf you do not have a STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths) background, but are more “artsy”, design (of products and services and user interfaces) is one of the surest ways for a non-technologist to thrive in an increasingly technocentric world. Strategy \nIn recent research conducted by the Cognizant Centre for the Future of Work, almost all of the 2,500 leading executives who were interviewed agreed that humans need to be more “strategic” in the face of growing automation. What does that mean? \nRote tasks, which still represent a substantial proportion of most people’s day-to-day work, are morphing into the machine, freeing up time and energy to ask better questions, craft better directions and generate more impactful innovation. \nThis is happening at the executive level within your organisation – and in the small department where perhaps you work. \nThe need to elevate the role of human relative to machine is the great challenge and opportunity in front of us all. So there will be plenty of work for strategists to help chief executives and boards understand what their company should do when machines do everything. \nAnd there will be plenty of work for people who can think strategically about the work they do and how to do it as software and robots become more and more intelligent, and more and more useful. \nA final thought is that only a third of the survey respondents thought that the rise of artificial intelligence would lead to large-scale reductions in the number of people needed to “do” work, which is the widespread meme in the zeitgeist about artificial intelligence (AI) and robots. \nThe vast majority believe, as does Cognizant, that unquenchable human ingenuity will continue to find plenty of work for human hands and brains to do to satisfy existing and emerging wants and needs. When machines do everything there will still be plenty for humans to do. You should get on with it. \nTo better understand how your company can benefit from artificial intelligence, visit whenmachinesdoeverything.com \nBen Pring is a co-author of What To Do When Machines Do Everything (Wiley 2017) and leads Cognizant’s Centre for the Future of Work. \n• This article was originally produced and published by Business Reporter.

      "title": "'Hello World': Blockstream Satellite to broadcast Bitcoin to the entire planet",
      "text": "08/24/17 AT 5:25 PM Close \nBlockchain technology company Blockstream has unveiled a satellite system that will bring Bitcoin connectivity to almost everyone on the planet. \nBillions of people all over the world struggle to connect to the internet; in many cases the cost of bandwidth relative to their income makes it prohibitive to do so. In addition to poor infrastructure and poverty, there are also places with lots of political instability, censorship and state control. \nNewsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York. Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup \nBlockstream CEO Dr Adam Back said: \"There are lots of places with internet problems, and sometimes whole countries get cut off due to wars or political instability and at those times the only kinds of connectivity that leak out of these countries are satellite communications and sat-phone and things like that. \n\"And there is also an interesting coincidence between countries with infrastructure challenges and unstable currencies - so there is also a demand for access to global internet money.\" \nBlockstream Satellite allows anyone to operate and maintain Bitcoin nodes across two thirds of the Earth's landmass, with additional coverage areas soon to come online to reach almost every person on the planet by the end of the year. \nAdam Back said: \"A high level way to look at it is, you've got the global GPS system for navigation; this is a global Bitcoin system so people can use Bitcoin everywhere.\" \nThe Blockstream Satellite network currently consists of three geosynchronous satellites that cover four continents - Africa, Europe, South America, and North America. Ground stations called teleports uplink the public Bitcoin blockchain data to the satellites in the network, which then broadcast the data across the globe. \nSetup costs are low, less than $100, which can be reduced further by using a recycled satellite dish - a regular TV satellite dish will do. There is no ongoing bandwidth cost once you've got it up and running. Blockstream Satellite brings the costs down by using GNU Radio , an open source software development toolkit which eliminates the need for specialised hardware. Performance is enhanced with Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE). \nChris Cook, head of satellite at Blockstream explained that rather than launching new satellites which is expensive and time consuming, the company is leasing time on existing commercial satellites. \nCook said: \"We had a look at the feasibility of launching satellites but were thinking, why launch our own satellite when there are plenty of interesting communication satellites up there that have capacity.\" \nHe pointed out that typically satellite equipment costs many thousands of dollars, but that using GNU Radio is major cost saving innovation. This involves a USB connection to the computer, and then it's a programmable radio, like analogue to digital radio processing equipment, which can be used to process all kinds of different signals. \nHe added: \"One of the other cost-saving advantages is that existing TV dishes can be re-used and the system of designs use very small dishes, particularly the ones that are 46 cm or 18 inches in diameter - so they are very common and very unobtrusive.\" \nDr Back added: \"A user or a local business can run a full node, receive all the data and then when they go to send a transaction, they can pay the bandwidth cost for that. A Bitcoin transaction is pretty small, like 250 bytes.\" \nHe said bidirectional satellite equipment which can be purchased quite cheaply on eBay could be added. Other communication channels people could use include local Wi-Fi, mesh networks, SMS gateways, dial up, or other kinds of low bandwidth, high distance radio equipment. \nFor example, a small business on the side of the road with a little petrol generator and a satellite dish on the roof, using a Rasberry Pi to receive the blockchain data and with a Wi-Fi hotspot, can manage to transact globally on the Bitcoin network. \nAs well as bringing more nodes and more decentralisation to the global Bitcoin network, Blockstream Satellite provides extra redundancy and an additional layer of reliability for blockchain data in the event of a network partition. \nBack said from the perspective of miners and Bitcoin businesses generally, \"if you're doing high value Bitcoin things or doing mining, you really want to make sure that you're on the Bitcoin network proper. Occasionally there will be internet disruptions where a transatlantic cable is cut or something like that and for a period of even hours you can have network splits. The satellite is a truly redundant link that protects against those kinds of issues for users and businesses.\" \nUsing a sail-over connection is also interesting in regard to places where Bitcoin's legal status is unclear, or a government wants to impose capital controls, filter the internet and so on. Back pointed out that the system leaves practically no footprint. \n\"If a government were looking at the internet connection or if it were going through a government-operated firewall or something, there would be no evidence of participating Bitcoin just coming down from the satellite. And the actual transactions will be very small so they leave a much smaller footprint and be much easier to lose in noise. So it's certainly much more possible to use Bitcoin privately, anonymously, and robustly.\" \nThe business of downloading full Bitcoin node software has also been made less onerous in recent times. One of the recent releases introduced pruned modes and there's a no-relay option as well. \"If you turn on all the bandwidth saving options and the disk storage options, your footprint is much smaller because it doesn't have to store the historic data, only the current data which will fit in a gigabyte of local storage. So you basically need something like an SD card or something like that, even on a Rasberry Pi,\" said Back. \nLooking ahead, Blockstream intends to add more features and programmability, so that smart phone wallet authors and Bitcoin application developers can also broadcast data by the satellite. Back added: \"If it was a particular application that needs to send a message to a recipient that can be broadcast by the satellite too for a small Bitcoin fee.\" Join the Discussion",

      "title": "TMW Systems Introduces Predictive Maintenance Analytics To Help Fleets Reduce Repair Costs, Increase Vehicle Uptime",
      "text": "TMW Systems has introduced a powerful predictive maintenance application, TMT Predict.Fault Code, that enables fleet professionals to anticipate and address potential vehicle breakdowns and other unscheduled service needs before they occur. The new application is the first tool to be offered under the company’s new TMT Predict Series of maintenance analytics solutions. The TMT Predict.Fault Code application works in conjunction with the PeopleNet Mobile Gateway (PMG) and Vusion data science to capture and analyze vehicle fault codes and other signal values representing more than 80 leading vehicle performance variables. When fault codes and other vehicle data indicate an increased probability of failure, a dashboard alert appears within the user’s TMT Fleet Maintenance software. The alert identifies the fleet’s assigned equipment number, vehicle identification number, probability of failure, Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) and description, leading performance variables triggering the probability, and other key equipment and signal values.\nThis new predictive maintenance capability is available for vehicles equipped with PMG via factory or aftermarket installation. The feature is currently offered for a number of leading commercial vehicle nameplates.\n“Preventing just 35 percent of unplanned repairs can save fleets thousands of dollars in hard costs alone,” said Renaldo Adler, principal, asset maintenance and fleet and service centers for TMW. “Many serious faults also can have a cascading effect on other vehicle systems if they aren’t caught in time. Our new predictive maintenance capabilities can help the fleet manager pull the vehicle out of operation before a problem becomes extremely expensive.”\nMaintenance costs for heavy-haul vehicles in North America have increased an estimated 50 percent over the past five years. Up to 20 percent of these costs are associated with vehicle breakdowns and other unplanned service events, according to industry sources. In fact, the cost of each unplanned event can reach thousands of dollars based on towing charges, lost labor, the purchase of replacement parts, shipper penalties and reduced margin.\nTo learn more about the TMT Predict.Fault Code application and TMT Predict Series, contact your TMW representative or call (800) 401-6682.\nAbout TMW Systems\nTMW is a leading transportation software provider to commercial and private fleets, brokerage and 3PL organizations. Founded in 1983, TMW has focused on providing enterprise software to the transportation industry, including asset-based and non-asset-based operations as well as heavy-duty vehicle service centers.

      "text": "by Brian Reigh 2 days ago \nGoogle’s recent acquisition of the health start-up Senosis Health might be the beginning of a telemedicine revolution. See also: One of Alphabet’s other divisions has made its own health-themed smartwatch April 15, 2017 \nSamsung has long been at the forefront of bringing health-related features to its flagship devices – not only do its high-end smartphones offer a built-in heartrate sensor, but they also tell you things like oxygen saturation levels through the company’s proprietary heath app. However, these features, as well as all other mobile health services available right now, remain more of a gimmick than anything else. Well, with Google’s recent acquisition, this might soon change. \nGeekWire exclusively reports that Google has agreed to buy a Seattle health start-up called Senosis Health, founded by Shwetak Patel, a University of Washington computer scientist. This isn’t the first time that Patel has scored big in terms of acquisitions: back in 2015, he sold his WallyHome sensor technology to Sears for an undisclosed amount of sum. \nYou could gather data that might indicate signs of lung diseases, certain tumors, kidney problems, and nutritional deficiency, wherever you are and whenever you want. \nAs you see in the video above, Senosis Health uses the phone’s camera, flash, microphone, and accelerometer to monitor and measure hemoglobin counts. In other words, you could gather data that might indicate signs of lung diseases, certain tumors, kidney problems, and nutritional deficiency, wherever you are and whenever you want. Those data can then be transmitted to and monitored by your primary doctor, reducing the amount of unnecessary hospital visits. That’s particularly useful for people who live in remote areas or who have difficulty traveling. Of course, Senosis Health’s broader application will depend on its accuracy, but it might have important implications for telemedicine. \nGoogle’s Verily division is reportedly in charge of the continued development of Senosis, and Patel’s hope for his app seems to resonate Verily’s mission statement, which aims to combine data science and healthcare innovations in order to help prolong people’s lives: \nThose sensors that are already on the mobile phone can be repurposed in interesting new ways, where you can actually use those for diagnosing certain kinds of diseases. \nIt might be a while until we see Google implement Senosis’ technology into its Android phones or even smartwatches (if at all), but its recent acquisition is any indication, the search giant’s effort to revolutionize healthcare – especially in the US – hasn’t stopped yet. \nWhat are your thoughts on telemedicine? Do you think Senosis Health is a gimmick or a game-changer? Let us know by leaving a comment below! ",

      "text": "08/15/17 AT 1:47 PM Close \nOn Tuesday, an initial coin offering launched by the real estate startup Propy Inc. sent shockwaves throughout the blockchain community. The tokenized fundraising campaign raised more than $5 million , attracting investors like billionaire TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington . Demand for Propy’s tokens, called PRO , was so high it overloaded the Ethereum network . \nAlthough the final earnings tally isn't in yet, because of the peak in Ethereum transaction volume, PRO token sales aren't expected to be a record-breaking sum like recent ICOs by Filecoin or Tezos . It’s not the cash that set tongues wagging; It’s Propy’s radical combination of cryptocurrency and Ethereum-based smart contracts, which could revolutionize the global real estate market . Propy’s approach could turn property into a highly liquid investment, easily tradable via a digital marketplace. This idea could fundamentally change the concept of real estate investments. \nNewsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York. Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup \n“If you’ve ever purchased property, it’s a particularly cumbersome transaction,” Aaron Wright, co-director of Cardozo Law School’s Blockchain Project and newly appointed chair of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance ’s legal working group, told International Business Times. These transactions take time because there is so much paperwork, mountains of paperwork. What if blockchain technology created a simple, smooth way to condense that data, verify it and send it across the world in mere seconds? \nThen there’s the issue of payments. With the kind of money real estate investments require, it’s rarely as simple as writing a check or sending a single wire transfer. Propy has seven different types of smart contracts , including ones that work with a money transmitter to automatically transfer ownership once payment has been processed. Another smart contract in development will notify local governments about the property transfer and taxes. “We help the government not interrupt the deal, but to get the information about the taxes,” Propy CEO Natalie Karayaneva told IBT. These smart contracts are only the tip of Propy’s iceberg. \nNatalie Karayaneva, founder and CEO of the blockchain startup Propy. Photo: Propy Inc. \nThe San Francisco-based startup already established on an online marketplace where international investors can shop for real estate in several languages. Eventually, the platform will enable peer-to-peer trading, like a cryptocurrency exchange for property investments. This will take a little more time for American buyers, because of the local legal framework. However, Karayaneva said the P2P conduit will go live much sooner in other countries, possibly within the next year or two. \n“In other countries, such as the Ukraine, we are already signing an agreement that they will use our blockchain, primary ledger as a base for storing and changing title deeds,” Propy CEO Natalie Karayaneva told IBT. “With several governments, we are in negotiation with them to use our blockchain ledgers so they can make their country’s real estate market transparent….so foreign investors will trust their land registry and will have more liquid opportunity to trade real estate.” \nSome of the biggest names in the tech and real estate industries are backing Propy, including Jeremy Gardner of Blockchain Capital and real estate mogul Alain Pinel . JLL , a leading real estate and investments management firm, already signed an agreement to use PRO and Propy’s blockchain property deeds in cross-border transactions, regardless of whether the local governments recognize electronic contracts yet. \nAccording to Wright, the U.S. has a solid legal basis for electronic contracts . Smart contracts are considered legally binding on a federal level. On a local level, some jurisdictions are taking that a step further, not just allowing electronic contracts but facilitating them. Cook County in Illinois already ran a successful pilot program for blockchain property records. \n“Let’s say I’m in another country and wanted to enter into a transaction in Cook County, it would be a lot easier for me to do that,” Wright said. “I wouldn’t have to come physically to the U.S., interface with county offices, in order to effectuate a real estate transaction.” It’s not hard to imagine Propy’s Amazon-style real estate store offering both P2P and more traditional property sales, using blockchain technology for everything from recordkeeping to the purchase itself. “The closing of the transactions is now in the prototype phase,” Karayaneva said. \nIn order for this idea to really take off, it would need widespread government support because governments maintain the land registries themselves. Like many startups relying on smart contracts, ultimately the technology’s full potential will only be realized if legal decision-makers get on board. “A lot of the contemplated use cases for blockchain technology ultimately reduce down to legal technology,” Wright said. “Talking about new agreements and new ways to memorialize commercial relationships.” \nEEA’s newly established legal group, with members from 14 top law firms and legal institutions , could work together almost like a bar association. “If a whole bunch of law firms say this is the way we are going to construct these smart contract programs, and the agreements that rely on those programs,” Wright said. “Well, you know what, that probably will influence how other countries and other parties view that.” \nWright said the EEA's legal group is sign the blockchain industry is maturing. If blockchain contracts overall continues to garner legal support, Propy’s approach could dramatically simplify international real estate investments. “Instead of 20 middlemen, they [buyers] will have only one broker. And he will also be online,” Karayaneva said. “It’s so easy, they [investors] will also have the feeling they can easily sell it. So the market will be really liquid.” \nKarayaneva, a real estate veteran from Bulgaria who came up with this startup idea after years of helping international investors buy property in Europe, said Propy’s blockchain approach could triple the global real estate market. It would also drastically reduce bureaucratic fees. PRO will be the cryptocurrency at the crux of it all, unlocking ownership transfers and contract changes. There are 100 million PRO tokens, with only around five million sold so far. The plan is to use tokens to attract new investors and invigorate the market as the network grows. \nWithin two years, most of Propy’s innovations should be up and running. “We’ve seen an incredible demand for our tokens already,” Karayaneva said. “We’ll see transactions happening in real-time. We’ll see kind of like a Bloomberg terminal for stocks, but for real estate.” Join the Discussion ",

      "title": "Jam City CEO Chris DeWolfe Talks Mobile Gaming Strategy—And A 2019 IPO",
      "text": "It’s not easy following a wise-ass robot and one-eyed spaceship captain. But Jam City CEO and MySpace co-founder Chris DeWolfe held his own as he thanked a packed audience of enthusiastic fans and industry folks who turned up at Hollywood’s Avalon Theater in June for a staged reading with the Futurama creators and the cast of its classic episode, “Proposition Infinity.”\nadvertisement The event launched the June release of the Futurama: World of Tomorrow mobile game from Jam City and subsidiary Tiny Co—its fourth venture with 20th Century Fox and the first mobile game to adapt a TV show no longer on the air. Instead of simply licensing a current intellectual property to cross-promote, this game utilizes the original creators, writers, and voice-over cast from the 1999-2013 animated Fox series to create new storylines within the gameplay.\nA non-current property might seem an odd choice for a new game. But it plays to a strategy that has transformed Jam City into a $370 million business: Listen to users. A Futurama game was actually Jam City’s top customer request. A social media marketing effort that uses original animation featuring Stephen Hawking, George Takei, Bill Nye, and Neil deGrasse Tyson has already racked up tens of millions of downloads and micro-transaction dollars.\n“I became sensitive to user experience at MySpace,” DeWolfe says. “Tapping the pop culture zeitgeist signaled it was going to be successful. Futurama now lives on in the game. For fans, it’s the only place you’ll be able to see new storylines from the original creators.”\nSince launching Jam City (formerly SGN) in Los Angeles in 2010, the mobile gaming company has navigated a consolidating industry to expand through acquisitions, Hollywood partnerships, innovative proprietary technology and data mining, and original game development. It now employs 500 staffers in six studios in California and Buenos Aires, and its games have been downloaded more than 800 million times and played by more than 50 million active monthly users worldwide. Last year (per the latest figures), six of Jam City’s 10 games ranked as iOS/Google Play top grossers: Cookie Jam (Facebook’s 2014 Game of the Year), Panda Pop , Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff , Juice Jam , Marvel Avenger Academy , and Genies and Gems . The company plans to triple the number of new game launches to some half dozen this year.\nadvertisement With 100% annual growth, compounded over the last five years, the firm anticipates nearly a half billion dollars in revenue over the next 12 months, and DeWolfe is considering taking Jam City public in the next two years.\n“We’ve designed the company to eventually reach predictable revenues and EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization],” Dewolfe says. “Aside from an influx of cash, a public offering cements a monetary value for the company and provides a currency for future acquisitions.”\nJam City’s business approach—one marked by a focused product line, calculated expansion, user experience over quick revenue growth, and inclusive corporate culture—borrows from DeWolfe’s traditional and digital business training and lessons learned from MySpace.\nThe Lessons of MySpace DeWolfe’s tenure at MySpace afforded him valuable lessons for building Jam City. After earning an MBA from the University of Southern California in 1997, he worked in the nascent cloud storage arena before co-founding MySpace in 2003. He sold it two years later to News Corp. for $580 million. It earned $700 million at its peak and remained the most visited site until 2008. Differing opinions on how to run MySpace led to DeWolfe amicably departing in 2009. Around this time, the site’s traffic steadily declined . Today MySpace is owned by Time, Inc.\nThe experience of running a digital start-up and assimilating with a traditional media conglomerate taught DeWolfe the importance of remaining focused on a few key features and prioritizing user experience before early revenues.\nAt MySpace, he says, “we tried to do everything all at once. It was the number one music destination. We built out streaming video, comedy, a movie and TV service, email and instant messaging—we had 12 different teams working on 12 different verticals and it got to be too much. We should have spent 90% of our resources on core social experience.” (In addition to operations, like page-load time.)\nadvertisement As for integrating an interactive digital startup that answered to users with a traditional media conglomerate that answered to shareholders, DeWolfe says, “News Corp. focused more on revenue and placed undue pressure on us to create profits instead of improving the user experience. We didn’t change it for a long time. We went from a growth company to a mature company when we weren’t ready; we were still growing.”\nBut in business, past errors provide critical information. “There’s something about learning from mistakes to figure out your focus, know how to create a smart business plan, pay attention to user experience, and when to make a company profitable,” DeWolfe says. “We operate our games as a service that we continually improve.”\nChris DeWolfe [Photo: Ethan Pines , courtesy of Jam City] Shortly after leaving MySpace, DeWolfe (alongside the digital startup’s co-founder Aber Whitcomb and former Fox media executive Josh Yguado) raised money from Austin Ventures to seed the Jam City operation. (Whitcomb is now Jam City’s CTO and Yguado is COO.) Over the next six years, the firm acquired several mobile gaming companies, built game development studios, and partnered with iconic intellectual properties and targeted global markets.\nAnd Jam City never loses sight of its core audience. “A lot of companies have failed, because they’ve gotten out of their sweet spot,” he says. “The games we develop are typically within a similar genre, demographic, and mindset—mostly female-focused, evergreen-type games—and have time-honored game mechanics [playing methods]. Like-minded demos makes them easier to cross-promote throughout our network.”\nJam City prototypes and consumer-tests new games for up to two years before launching. Afterward, the company continues to update the games’ play modes, social interactivity, character storylines, and opportunities to purchase virtual goods, DeWolfe explains, “so you don’t have this decay occur where you build a game, it’s a hit like a movie, and then you have to look for your next revenue stream. It’s not like the TV or film industry. We’re thinking about what’s going to be cool in 2019 and how to update current products, as opposed to jumping on what was hot last year.”\nHappier Gamers Through Analytics Deep investments in technological innovation, data science, and audience intelligence have helped Jam City forge a competitive advantage by streamlining game development and enhancing user experience.\nadvertisement Early on, before such technology became ubiquitous across the mobile gaming industry, Jam City developed proprietary software to continue games where they left off across four platforms. The software not only gave it a leg up on competitors, but also made it possible to publish games simultaneously on those platforms without having to redevelop them for each one, which effectively shaved six months of development time per game, had they been built separately per platform. Today, that software is farmed out to Unity, but in-house programmers continue to upgrade physics engines to handle more complex movement, gaming mechanics, and narratives, while machine learning optimizes gameplay by tracking playing patterns.\nLast year, DeWolfe hired two doctorates—in chemical engineering computer-aided design and experimental psychology—to grow the company’s consumer research and machine learning/artificial intelligence divisions to optimize gameplay per user playing patterns, game interaction, and purchasing behavior.\nBringing a Jam City game to market is both a creative and data-driven process. During development, Jam City developers create a “slice” of a game and use A.I. to test consumer engagement and retention, then analyze player behaviors with a goal of making—and keeping—those games more appealing. Fine-tuning continues after launch.\n“Each game has its own economy, with merchandising, sales and events, marketing, customer acquisition, lifetime value of customers,” DeWolfe says. “We can constantly tweak and make them better, or test their performance in different economies. If too many people are dropping out of games or tutorials, or not moving onto next levels fast enough, we change that so it remains enticing.”\nIndividual game titles can grow into billion-dollar businesses. “We are building mobile franchises,” he says. “Our games are designed to be played for 10 years or longer, and we can continue to add more content based on new insights. Our original games are developed to grow into iconic brands with worldwide recognition and appeal.”\nadvertisement A Culture of Inclusion Motivating employees through an inclusive corporate culture and philanthropy is another strategy rooted in DeWolfe’s MBA days and honed at MySpace.\n“It’s much more of a ‘we’ thing,” DeWolfe says. “I work with awesome co-founders with very different strengths. We try to make a creative space for artists, game designers, engineers, musicians, and producers to work in harmony.”\nJam City employees participate in team-building activities with Habitat for Humanity, Los Angeles Mission, and Los Angeles River clean-ups. For the launch of its latest game, Snoopy Pop , Jam City donated $100,000 to Canine Companions for Independence, a favorite charity of the family of Snoopy creator Charles M. Schulz (and a natural fit for Jam City’s dog-friendly office). “We want our employees to feel proud of the company they work for,” DeWolfe says.\nDeWolfe tries to match that culture when considering acquisitions. “We only acquire companies with similar cultural values and game mechanics that fit with our other IP, and try to partner with the CEO of the other company,” he says. “We’ve pulled out of deals after negative focus group feedback on IP or not being able to agree culturally. You can’t try to force synergies where none exist.”",

      "text": "News Stay informed about the latest enterprise technology news and product updates. AI washing muddies the artificial intelligence products market by Bridget Botelho Editorial Director Artificial intelligence products are the future and many tech vendors are AI washing to trick potential customers into thinking they're buying leading-edge software.   Focus: Artificial intelligence in the enterprise –ComputerWeekly.com \nAnalysts predict that by 2020, artificial intelligence technologies will be in almost every new software and service release. And if they're not actually in them, technology vendors will probably use smoke and mirrors marketing tactics to make users believe they are. \nMany tech vendors already shoehorn the AI label into the marketing of every new piece of software they develop, and it's causing confusion in the market. To muddle things further, major software vendors accuse their competitors of egregious mislabeling, even when the products in question truly do include artificial intelligence technologies. \nAI mischaracterization is one of the three major problems in the AI market, as highlighted by Gartner recently. More than 1,000 vendors with applications and platforms describe themselves as artificial intelligence products vendors, or say they employ AI in their products, according to the research firm. It's a practice Gartner calls \"AI washing\" -- similar to the cloudwashing and greenwashing , which have become prevalent over the years as businesses overexaggerate their association to cloud computing and environmentalism. Five ways to see through AI washing AI goes beyond machine learning \nWhen a technology is labelled AI, the vendor must provide information that makes it clear how AI is used as a differentiator and what problems it solves that can't be solved by other technologies, explained Jim Hare, a research VP at Gartner, who focuses on analytics and data science. You have to go in with the assumption that it isn't AI, and the vendor has to prove otherwise. Jim Hare research VP, Gartner \n\"You have to go in with the assumption that it isn't AI, and the vendor has to prove otherwise,\" Hare said. \"It's like the big data era -- where all the vendors say they have big data -- but on steroids.\" \n\"What I'm seeing is that anything typically called machine learning is now being labelled AI, when in reality it is weak or narrow AI, and it solves a specific problem,\" he said. \nIT buyers must hold the vendor accountable for its claims by asking how it defines AI and requesting information about what's under the hood, Hare said. Customers need to know what makes the product superior to what is already available, with support from customer case studies. Also, Hare urges IT buyers to demand a demonstration of artificial intelligence products using their own data to see them in action solving a business problem they have. \nBeyond that, a vendor must share with customers the AI techniques it uses or plans to use in the product and their strategy for keeping up with the quickly changing AI market, Hare said. \nThe second problem Gartner highlights is that machine learning can address many of the problems businesses need to solve. The buzz around more complicated types of AI , such as deep learning, gets so much hype that businesses overlook simpler approaches. \n\"Many companies say to me, 'I need an AI strategy' and [after hearing their business problem] I say, 'No you don't,'\" Hare said. \nReally, what you need to look for is a solution to a problem you have, and if machine learning does it, great,\" Hare said. \"If you need deep learning because the problem is too gnarly for classic ML, and you need neural networks -- that's what you look for.\" Weak AI vs. strong AI \nBroadly, there are two types of AI: \nWeak AI is pervasive today in the form of chatbots, which serve a specified purpose. \nStrong AI tools go much further; these tools come up with solutions to problems on their own, through massive amounts of data and cognitive computing capabilities. Don't use AI when BI works fine \nWhen to use AI versus BI tools was the focus of a spring TDWI Accelerate presentation led by Jana Eggers, CEO of Nara Logics, a Cambridge, Mass., company, that describes its \"synaptic intelligence\" approach to AI as the combination of neuroscience and computer science. \nBI tools use data to provide insights through reporting, visualization and data analysis, and people use that information to answer their questions. Artificial intelligence differs in that it's capable of essentially coming up with solutions to problems on its own, using data and calculations. \nCompanies that want to answer a specific question or problem should use business analytics tools. If you don't know the question to ask, use AI to explore data openly, and be willing to consider the answers from many different directions, she said. This may involve having outside and inside experts comb through the results, perform A/B testing, or even outsource via platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk . \nWith an AI project, you know your objectives and what you are trying to do, but you are open to finding new ways to get there, Eggers said. AI isn't easy \nA third issue plaguing AI is that companies don't have the skills on staff to evaluate, build and deploy it, according to Gartner . Over 50% of respondents to Gartner's 2017 AI development strategies survey said the lack of necessary staff skills was the top challenge to AI adoption. That statistic appears to coincide with the data scientist supply and demand problem. \nCompanies surveyed said they are seeking artificial intelligence products that can improve decision-making and process automation, and most prefer to buy one of the many packaged AI tools rather than build one themselves. Which brings IT buyers back to the first problem of AI washing; it's difficult to know which artificial intelligence products truly deliver AI capabilities, and which ones are mislabeled. \nAfter determining a prepackaged AI tool provides enough differentiation to be worth the investment, IT buyers must be clear on what is required to manage it, Hare said; what human services are needed to change code and maintain models over the long term? Is it hosted in a cloud service and managed by the vendor, or does the company need knowledgeable staff to keep it running? \n\"It's one thing to get it deployed, but who steps in to tweak and train models over time?\" he said. \"[IBM] Watson, for example, requires a lot of work to stand up and you need to focus the model to solve a specific problem and feed it a lot of data to solve that problem.\" \nCompanies must also understand the data and compute requirements to run the AI tool, he added; GPUs may be required and that could add significant costs to the project. And cutting-edge AI systems require lots and lots of data. Storing that data also adds to the project cost. Next Steps",

      "text": "Manuchi / Pixabay\nHave you ever clicked around a web application that has cool, fast, or smart functionality and wondered “How’d they do that?” Have you built an MVP of your web app and are now looking to add new modules to improve its user-facing functionality?\nThere are a number of ways applications can leverage APIs and data science to build on their basic functionality. Tools like recommendation engines, chatbots, SMS messaging, and personalization make the interactive, immersive experiences we know and love possible.\nHere, we’ll dissect the tools and technology behind some popular sites so you can start to implement similar ideas in your own application. But before we get into some of these specific functionalities, let’s take a quick look at what’s at the heart of nearly everything we do: application programming interfaces (APIs).\nAPIs For Everything Ubiquitous both in native mobile applications and on the web, APIs are the building blocks that allow applications to tap into shared services and data, generally making apps more tailored, efficient, and useful. For all intents and purposes, this article could be “9 APIs Behind Smart Web Applications”—but to get you thinking more about the business implications of these tools, we’ll focus on real-world applications and how weaving in more tailored, data-driven experiences can drive engagement, sales, and loyalty.\nLearn more about the full scope of the power of APIs with Upwork’s free ebook The API Economy to see how APIs have revolutionized marketing and web development.\nTo give you ideas on how to take your web app to the next level, here are a few ways some popular web apps are using APIs to enrich user experiences.\n1. Connect a user’s various accounts with APIs. How do certain apps seem to “borrow” information from another app, creating a seamless, immersive experience for its users? For example, how does the Sonos app, which lets you control speakers around your home from your phone, seamlessly connect to all of your music accounts like Spotify, SoundCloud, Pandora, Last.fm, Google Play Music, and Amazon Music? The short answer: integrated APIs.\n\n[Above, left to right: the Sonos app, Uber’s Autoplay Music services, and Nike Run Club’s music streaming options.]\nMany popular services like Facebook have open APIs that allow third-party applications to tap into their data and services. For example, an app like Uber or Nike Run Club can embed a SoundCloud audio player or access a user’s SoundCloud account information, e.g.: playlists, liked tracks, etc., to make the app more engaging to their own users.\nConnecting accounts via APIs can streamline things for users and businesses alike. Want to run a giveaway, but a stipulation to enter is having an entrant follow you on Twitter? APIs make this a one-touch process for users, reducing friction with the process and making them less likely to forgo entering altogether.\nThe gist here is providing users with convenience and personalization, making your app even more useful to someone by doing the connecting part for them. What services or apps could your app integrate with to make life easier—and your app more indispensable to users?\nFind a skilled API developer to get started.\n2. Use OAuth 2.0 to give users the ability to securely sign in with other accounts. Taking the convenience of APIs a step further, using a framework like OAuth 2.0 allows users to skip the process of remembering login information, and delegates the sharing of their protected resources between applications. It’s one of the easiest ways to reduce friction with your application, allowing users to easily (and safely) sign in to your app using the same credentials they do for another account, whether that’s Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.\n\nLearn more about authorization and the OAuth 2.0 framework or browse skilled OAuth freelancers to help you get started.\n3. Communicate with customers via SMS. Is there a more efficient way of communicating than a text message? When it comes to convenience, giving customers a way to receive notifications without having to open their email app—or your app—is becoming the new norm. SMS communications make it possible for an app to send a quick text that an order has been shipped or a reservation has been confirmed.\nIn particular, the Twilio suite of APIs target communication functionalities, assigning apps with a phone number that pings messages from a business to the Twilio cloud, then to the user’s device. Learn more about the various types of communication the Twilio APIs can field in this article .\n4. Integrate live chat support, or automate customer support with a chatbot. Everyone knows the value of FAQs when it comes to finding valuable information on a website. But having in-app chat support makes it even easier for users to get answers to their questions in real time, with little to no delay. Businesses can use software like Zendesk Chat to integrate live chat support services into their app.\n\n[Above, Liquid Web hosting service proactively features a live chat support with a human. Some applications can even detect if a customer is hanging around a page and not clicking to chime in and ask if they can help.]\nWhat if you don’t have the resources to have an around-the-clock customer support professional to field live chat requests? Chatbots are quickly becoming the new standard for proactive, personalized help and live support on websites. They save businesses time and money by automating responses to inquiries in real time, right where your customers need it.\nSome more simple chatbots can be programmed to have a keyboard with preset questions and responses, limiting the AI required to make them “smart” enough to efficiently communicate with humans without frustrating “I’m sorry, I can’t help you with that” responses. More complex chatbots use machine learning and natural language processing to turn human phrases into commands machines can understand, so “Why hasn’t my ordered arrived yet?” will generate recent order data and shipment status imported from the carrier’s API.\nLearn more about the value of chatbots and how they work .\n5. Personalize interactions (think: targeted landing pages) from the start with customized content. If you’ve ever gotten a book recommendation when you logged in to Amazon that’s based on books you’ve bought before, that’s dynamic content . Dynamic content (also called “smart” or “adaptive” content) is the HTML code behind the seemingly “moveable text” that changes based on a user’s behavior or demographic information. It’s commonly used in websites and landing pages , as well as marketing emails.\n\n[Recommended items on the Amazon homepage.]\nHow can you put this technology to use? Personalization can change every part of a user’s experience, from the information they see on a landing page tailored to the related items they see while browsing your site. All of these tactics aim to create a UX that’s geared to that person’s particular interests and will make browsing your site more relevant and intuitive to them, whether they’re existing users, sales prospects, or first-time visitors.\nLearn more about dynamic content and who you need to built it into your application.\n6. Use someone’s location to tailor content. When you visit a website, how convenient is it to have an application automatically detect your browser location to tell you where the nearest brick and mortar store location is? Check out how Lowes.com gives you store hours for the nearest location the second you land on their homepage:\n\nEcommerce sites are able to use geotargeting to combine weather data with related items, whether those are AC units and fans to an area experiencing a heatwave, or snow shovels and space heaters for an area soon to get a winter storm.\nThe possibilities are endless when it comes to marketing and tailoring content to users based on where they are.\n7. Use smart search to streamline an application’s UX. Adding search functionality into a site is a given—and probably the easiest way to let users navigate your site and find what they’re looking for without having to really look . But what about making search central to the UX of your site—tying together efforts like marketing, filtering, and analytics to give your users exactly what they need right when they arrive?\n\nTake Upwork’s homepage, for example. Chances are if you’ve heard of Upwork, you’re coming to the site to search for freelancers. Right off the bat, the site presents you with a search bar wrapped in an accompanying campaign to guide you in so you can find what you’re looking for.\nSearch can be built into a site any number of ways. You might opt to integrate with a third-party search service, or you might write your own search script (maybe even with autocomplete) with a backend script like PHP. For a site built on the WordPress content management system, search is often built into a theme and requires some database integration.\n8. Drive engagement and sales by recommending related items, songs, events, and more. There’s something very engaging about a site that can cut through the noise and show you results tailored to you and your preferences—when the data is available. Whether you’ve been to the app and browsed or purchased before, the app is pulling in browsing/purchase data from a third-party API, or things are being suggested to you based on your location. These kinds of recommendations can be powerful to users and to the growth of your business.\n\nOn the Lowe’s homepage, some default recommended items are suggested based on the season, what’s popular among other users, and perhaps even popular items in the user’s area. When signed in, these results could be more tailored to the user’s previous purchases or browsing history.\nOnline retailer Shopbop uses a recommendation engine to suggest related items on every single product page. No matter what you’re viewing, you’re able to see five other items with similar attributes below, allowing you to compare prices and styles.\nThe technology behind this is known as a recommendation engine. There are two types of recommendation engines based on slightly different sciences: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering . Recommendation engines are also a common application for the science of predictive analytics .\n\nRecommendation engines are widely used across social media, retail, and streaming services and are excellent wants to keep users on your site, increase revenue with add-on purchases, and more. You experience collaborative filtering first-hand every time you go online and see “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,” or “Users like you also liked.” Content-based filtering is built around the attributes of a given object, while collaborative filtering relies on the behavior of other users.\nBuilding a recommender system with collaborative filtering is a major project requiring expertise with data processing and storage frameworks like Hadoop or Spark . Find a data scientist to help you get started implementing this functionality into your site.\n9. Boost engagement with browser push notifications. Any mobile phone user is familiar with push notifications —pop up alerts that send us updates from our apps. For desktop browsing, applications can enable web push notifications if a user opts in from a supported browser.\nFor example, a web application like SoundCloud offers users the option to turn on browser notifications, a cool feature that lets you see what song is playing each time it switches without you having to click back over to that tab or window to see the title of the track.\n\nAbove, the Settings page enables a user to opt in for browser notifications and manage when those notifications happen. Below, a browser push notification appears on the top right of the screen.\n\nDesktop browser push notifications can be accomplished a few ways, either by implementing a custom backend solution with scripts and APIs , or by using a third-party service.\nConclusion \nThere are many ways to approach the development of your app, the key is to prioritize business needs and then translate to clear, concise product requirements. Once you’re ready to move, tap into the power of freelancers on Upwork, a smart way to build a smart app.\n",

      "text": "By Staff on at \nFrom addiction to anxiety to bullying, technology and social media get a bad rap at times for their negative impact on mental health. \nSmaller-scale research about this impact and its effects are on the rise — with Instagram being the latest service to capture a picture of what’s going on with a users’s mental health. \nAccording to a study published last week in the EPJ Data Science journal, researchers at Harvard University and the University of Vermont questioned whether markers of depression could be identified through photos posted on the popular social media site. \nAfter using a variety of computational methods including machine-learning and image processing to review nearly 44,000 photographs posted by 166 study participants (identified as “healthy” or “depressed” based on a past clinical diagnosis), their answer was yes. \nMachines analysed user activity, how many “likes” and comments a photo received, and the number of faces in a photo. Interestingly, depressed individuals shared posts at a higher frequency, and while those posts received a higher rate of comments, they received fewer likes. Their photos did feature faces, but fewer faces than the healthier participants. \nThe researchers also analysed photo hue, saturation and value, and whether or not a filter (and what type of filter) was used. Photos posted by depressed individuals tended to be, pixel-by-pixel, bluer, darker and greyer; and were less likely than those from the healthy participants to have a filter applied. When depressed participants used filters, they favoured converting colour photos to black and white. \nPerhaps even more interesting though is that the researchers were not only able to confirm depression in a person who had already received a formal diagnosis, but the data was able to predict depression pre-diagnosis. \nIn an interview with the New York Times , the researchers were clear to state that while the sample size was small, and of a very specifically recruited group of active Instagrammers who were willing to share a past clinical diagnosis of depression, “the results speak more to the promise of their techniques.” Tags: ",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO- Performance Horizon today announces a significant step forward for marketers with the addition of proprietary artificial intelligence capabilities to support its rapidly growing ecosystem of merchants, marketing partners, developers, and best in breed technology companies.\nCustomers trialling the new AI capabilities include Marriott Hotels & Resorts, British Airways, and leading fashion marketplace The Iconic.\nPerformance Horizon’s platform makes it simple for merchants to on board, track, optimize, and pay any type of partner from a Fortune 500 brand to a niche blog. The platform is operational globally, and is localised for language, and settlement & payment in 210 countries. With this scalable infrastructure in place, Performance Horizon is uniquely positioned to handle partner driven conversion data for the largest global companies.\nExisting Performance Horizon customers already include 6 of the top 10 largest US companies by market cap. Customers can use Performance Horizon’s platform to globally scale all types of partnership models including loyalty, referral, business development, and affiliate marketing partners.\nAffiliate marketing grew in popularity due to its attractive pay-for-performance model but has faced scalability challenges. It never quite attracted the attention of the C suite or the level of marketing budget that paid search or display commands. The demand for accurate measurement, data driven decision, and an increased level of automation has held marketers back. Performance Horizon has solved these scalability challenge and is working with customers that have taken the pay-for-performance model of affiliate marketing to the next level, applying it to all of their marketing partnership activity, significantly increasing the reach and effectiveness of their marketing spend.\nPartner marketing underpinned by scalable data driven technology is now rapidly being adopted by enterprises as a key growth driver underlined by Performance Horizon’s 150+ global 2000 customers, 230,000 marketing partnerships, and $650MM in fees paid out to partners to date.\n“Further investment into specific AI-powered functionality, and over time general AI is core to our vision to build a truly scalable partnerships ecosystem. We see huge upside potential for our customers and their marketing partners, so we’re investing for the long term,” said Malcolm Cowley, Performance Horizon’s CEO. “Providing merchants with the ability to predict their partners’ performance across the entire path-to-purchase is the first step to achieving our vision.”\n“Building our AI capabilities in-house was complex, but our first goal was simple - to help clients understand future performance,” said Pete Cheyne, Performance Horizon CTO. “To start, we explored 50 billion events tracked on behalf of clients to understand the activity profiles for a wide range of campaigns and partners. Our data science team then developed five different prediction models ranging from iterative linear regression to a neural network model. Through continuous evaluation, our platform is able to dynamically select the prediction model for each client that is most effective. This way we ensure that we present customers with predictions that are tailored to them; we didn’t want to build a one-size-fits-all solution.”\n“Most of the current noise around AI is marketing hype of vanity features. Our goal with these new capabilities is to make AI accessible to customers in a way that is simple to use and actually drives tangible business results,” added Alistair Wyse, Performance Horizon CIO.\nPerformance Horizon plans to deploy additional AI-enhanced capabilities across its platform in the coming months with a focus on helping customers develop additional partnerships, drive efficiencies at scale, and reduce risk.\nTo learn more about how your company can benefit by taking control of your marketing partnerships with Performance Horizon, visit: www.performancehorizon.com\nAbout Performance Horizon\nPerformance Horizon is the leading provider of SaaS solutions for partner marketing, enabling enterprises to drive significant business growth with their marketing partners.\nThe world’s top retail, travel and financial services companies rely on Performance Horizon’s highly scalable platform to connect to more than 230,000 marketing partners in 210 countries around the world. Benefits include flexible partner and affiliate management capabilities; real-time measurement and analysis of performance on the web and on mobile apps; payment processing and settlement in 60 currencies.

      "text": "Flickr / Tony Alter. Licensed under Creative Commons 2.0 \nWith each new year, the workforce and its needs look a little different from the year before. \nThis difference is still yet greater between decades, but especially so in the last two or three. Massive advancements in tech and science have redesigned the work landscape, and in doing so have altered what qualities and skills employers look for when hiring for today’s world. \nSome of these trends are easier to spot: more of an emphasis on familiarity with social media, coding, big data manipulation, and technical skills as they apply to tech. But just because these seem like the most obvious areas to jump into does not mean that other sociological or interpersonal skills have become any less important. In fact, they’re even more important now. \nA recent analysis examined 24 million job listings in order to determine what key skills, across nine industries, employers were actively looking to find. The result? \nEmployers want multifaceted employees who possess “hard” skills like technical digital skills as well as “soft” skills like the ability to work with a team and communicate effectively. \nWhile developing hard skills is important for the job and the résumé, in an increasingly diverse and global workforce, it is the hybrid employee that will be the most attractive to employers. \nOne of the easiest and most concrete ways to show your ability in hard and soft skills is by offering a class that you’ve completed to develop and learn them. Thankfully, they don’t have to be expensive. \nRight now, Udemy has slashed prices on its courses from $A205 to $A15. Simply use the code ” AUG203USN ” at checkout. 1.

      "text": "Government Websites Can Better Serve Citizens with These 3 Marketing Tools in 2018 \n  \nNot long ago, being “online” meant having a website to dump all of your information. Then came the explosion of blogging and social media to fight for eyeballs. More content is now being created than ever before. \nToday, there are a whopping 3,000 commercial messages the average person sees every day. Concepts such as search-engine optimization, user experience and analytics sprang up in order to make sense out of the sheer amount of noise online. \nBut those strategies are no longer enough. Now, it’s about elevating the content game even further, shifting to deliver personalized experiences, and using data to optimize decisions for the next marketing investment. \nUnderstanding the trends and getting the tools to meet these expectations will make government agencies much more equipped to serve their citizens. \n3 Tools to Vastly Improve Your Citizens’ Online Experience \nWhen a citizen visits a government website, they are going with a purpose, usually looking for something very specific. This busy person expects a website to deliver exactly what’s on their mind, as fast as possible. \nThat means government websites have to go beyond simply having the most beautiful, intuitive and easy-to-understand experience. They need to understand the user’s exact desire and deliver on it. \nSo how is it possible to achieve that? Especially when each user may be looking for something different? The good news is there are powerful, digital tools out there to allow government agencies to achieve that level of connection in a fast, easy way. \nThey can do this in three ways: Through segmentation and personalized messaging (read more about it here ); By optimizing the experience through A/B testing (read more about it here ) Via data science (read more about it here ). \nData monitoring is key, because the only sure way to be sure you are making the most informed decisions is by analyzing patterns —you will see what your citizens are asking for by how long they spend on each page, where they are clicking most, etc. \nIt’s easier than ever to keep your team focused on the primary purpose of the website: to get your users to complete a specific action. Making your user journey easier and easier through the study of data is called conversion optimization . It trains your team to make unbiased decisions based on user data, not just based on opinion about what feels right. You can track your wins and test your theories. \nThe combination of these three platforms (personalized messaging, A/B testing, and data) empowers agencies to set up campaigns, understand each individual citizen journey, and confidently improve it at every stage. \nUsing digital tools to help you serve your audience in a more personalized way requires a bit of a shift in thinking within the organization. It will start with empowering your in-house staff with the insights and tools to learn more about the citizens. That means you will have to set up foundations that help your teams monitor, manage and measure people’s true preferences. Once you get it right, you’ll realize that investing in the right solutions now will offer great returns in both the short- and long-term. \nA tip: It’s best not to think of users as customers. Your citizens reading your information are people. And people crave communities, shared identities, emotional connections, and close-to-true face-to-face interactions. Acknowledging that is the first step toward raising the bar and being a more effective content provider. \n2018: The Year for a Closer Connection Between Government and Citizen \nI’ll say it again: 2018 will be the year of personalization and connection. Citizens are paying more attention to their government. They crave direct communication and a feeling of understanding from the organizations that serve them. \nUnderstanding how users behave online and the best way to communicate to them personally are critical for government agencies in 2018. Agencies have an opportunity, through digital experience, to put a face to government. Now is the time for government agencies to get creative, over-deliver and wow their citizens. \nMany states are already rolling out business gateway portals that do this. These are one-stop-shops for citizens to get everything they need as business owners. The information is presented in a personalized, organized way that helps citizens find exactly what they need—whether it be licenses to start a business or information about filing taxes. The portals make sure they’re effective by tracking user data. \nIn the end, the goal of building personalized online experiences is to achieve a higher level of citizen trust and loyalty. If citizens feel engaged and productive, they will feel taken care of by their government and return to seek more information. A thoughtful and seamless online experience is the perfect way to achieve this.",

      "text": "Anthony Bourdain Reveals His ‘Disgusting, Shameful’ Traveling Guilty Pleasure In case you've been hiding out in an internet-less hole for the last few months and hadn't heard, there's a once-in-a-lifetime celestial event taking place on Monday August 21. The historic total solar eclipse will be visible from practically all corners of the contiguous United States, though it'll be most striking along what's called the \"path of totality,\" a band of territory stretching from Oregon to South Carolina. Areas within the path will be treated to minutes of stunning darkness when the moon completely blocks out the sun. Unsurprisingly, hordes of people are making plans to flock to cities within the path of totality for the next-level view, and it's caused flights to nearby airports to skyrocket, in some cases to quadruple what they'd be normally . To find out just how much pricier it is to get there, we asked the data science team from the super-useful airfare search engine Hopper to dig up some stats, and also help locate any \"deals\" to be had for last-minute eclipse-chasers . According to Hopper, flights to destinations along the path of totality have been, on average, around 80% more expensive this year than they were for the same weekend last year, based on purchases made within a 21-day window before the trip. Specifically, flights to Portland, Oregon, are up 111% (rising from $161.18 to $339.90), flights to Charleston, South Carolina, rose roughly 80% (up to $458.09 from $254.70), and flights to Nashville, Tennessee, are up by 77% (from $248.20 to $439.61). Based on some of our own searches, many last-minute flights to prime locations from New York City, Los Angeles, and elsewhere are eye-poppingly high. As of Tuesday afternoon, the cheapest roundtrip airfare from New York to Nashville (August 18 - August 22) was nearly $1,300, while the cheapest flights for the same dates from Los Angeles to Portland were almost $800. That's not to say there aren't ways around spending a fortune to get to a prime viewing area. Hopper's team points out that if you're down to drive for a couple hours , opting for a slightly more distant hub city destination can get you a good deal. For instance, flights from New York to Atlanta (August 19 - August 23) are currently going for a reasonable $370 on Delta, and tickets from New York to Charlotte (August 19 - August 23) are just $330 on American Airlines at the moment. They also recommend extending the trip if you can (e.g., departing this Thursday, August 17, and returning the Wednesday or Thursday after the eclipse), as that will drop the trip price considerably. Of course, if you don't feel like shelling out to schlep to one of these primo spots, you'll still be able to catch the eclipse in some capacity from just about everywhere in the lower 48. In fact, there's a handy site will give you a preview of just what to expect to see in the sky from wherever you'll be during the big event on August 21. Wanna see the solar eclipse for yourself?

      "text": "August 16, 2017 at 6:00 am August 15, 2017 at 5:14 pm GeekWire Summit: Early-bird tickets here! \nAn IBM z14 mainframe computer. (IBM Photo) \nIt’s sometimes hard to believe how many companies are running enterprise applications on technologies first conceived before mass adoption of the internet, but mainframes have been a stubborn presence inside an awful lot of large, older companies for years. Docker thinks mainframe users should be able to take advantage of the benefits of containers, and is rolling out a new version of its Docker Enterprise Edition software to help them out. \nThe new version, which will be generally available on Wednesday, also includes new features for managing roles occupied by different members of a software development organization as well as updates that streamline the application deployment process for users particularly concerned about security and compliance. Enterprise Edition is the paid, supported version of Docker’s free open-source software for managing containers on cloud or on-premises infrastructure. \nWith this new version, Docker is setting its sights squarely on big enterprise technology departments that have money to spend on much-needed renovations to modernize their development processes, something new Docker CEO Steve Singh said would be an area of emphasis for the company at our GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit in June . \nDocker worked with IBM to allow zSystems customers to run Docker Enterprise Edition, said David Messina, senior vice president of marketing for Docker, Docker already runs across Linux and Windows environments, but now mainframe customers — which include venerable financial companies, insurance companies, and believe it or not, airlines — can get the benefits provided by containers, such as easier maintenance and faster deployments, without having to change their source code. \nOne of the biggest benefits of containerizing an application, or breaking it down into smaller independent pieces, is that you can update that application with new features or fix security holes without having to plow through the entire code base. The number of applications running on mainframes is quite small compared to those running on the Linux or Windows machines that form the basis of the public cloud and most data centers, but they’re still running, and mainframes are often running very business-critical applications that require the stability of Big Iron . \n“Enterprises have hundreds if not thousands of applications, especially if you’re talking about the Global 2000 ,” Messina said. “They’re seeing a great opportunity here to get these modernized without changing the application or changing my policies, but getting new ways to patch things.” \nThe new version of the software also gives administrators more options for setting roles across software teams, said Jenny Fong, director of product marketing at Docker. This makes it easier to ensure that teams working on different projects within the same Docker cluster don’t bump into each other, and allows the administrator to dole out resources exactly where they are needed, she said. A breakdown of Docker Enterprise Edition features. (Docker Photo) \nDocker is also making it easier for administrators to manage images — basically, containers that aren’t running at a given moment — within their environments, Fong said. They can now automate the process of moving an image into a production environment and prevent image tags from being overridden once they reach that production environment. That helps administrators at companies with strict policies around what gets pushed into the production environment stay on top of everything. \nEnterprise Edition is probably Docker’s best hope for generating revenue, something it needs to start doing at a much greater clip if it wants to live up to its lofty valuation. All the major public cloud vendors also offer container management services, although they support Docker EE running on their clouds. \nDocker is reportedly seeking to raise another $75 million to help it move past its reputation as a technology wunderkind that has struggled to make actual money, and that’s also why Docker’s board tapped Singh , an enterprise computing veteran, to run the show. Singh is betting that while Docker has struggled to make money off a product that is extremely popular with forward-thinking software developers, there are still an awful lot of companies that have yet to embrace containers, and they’ll need Docker’s help to get up and running.

Learn more Microsoft Chicago ThinkChicago Lollapalooza: Bringing Together Remarkable Students August 15, 2017 by Anna Draft, MSFT Chicago Civic Tech Fellow Anna Draft, MSFT Chicago Civic Tech Fellow • Leave a comment \nEvery summer, Chicago’s signature music festival, Lollapalooza , fills Grant Park with the sounds of musicians and music fans. The word, Lollapalooza, meaning “remarkable person or thing,” defines not just the music festival, but it has also come to define the remarkable students that visit Chicago each year for ThinkChicago. \nThinkChicago takes place the week leading up to Lollapalooza (the music festival) with the goal of retaining and attracting top tech talent to Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel , World Business Chicago and the University of Illinois , invite University students to Chicago to learn about the city’s vibrant innovation ecosystem, and to show visiting students what an incredible place Chicago is to live and work. For the third year in a row, Microsoft has had the honor of contributing to ThinkChicago’s wonderful efforts . This year, we facilitated a panel on Civic Innovation and we introduced the students to Microsoft Chicago’s efforts in Machine Learning, Civic Technology and Urban Engagement. \nThe first day of ThinkChicago kicked off at Motorola Chicago, where the students were welcomed by Mayor Emanuel. \nFollowing Mayor Emanuel’s introductions, Microsoft’s own Shelley Stern Grach moderated a panel on Civic Innovation in Chicago. The panel featured Charlie Catlett from the Urban Center for Computation and Data (UrbanCCD) , Danielle DuMerer from the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) , Katie Olson from UILABS , and Kenneth Watkins from Blue1647 . The discussion focused on how science and technology are enabling and empowering Chicago’s communities. Many of the key messages expressed the importance of policy, and transparency and collaboration amongst various sectors, as vital to driving innovation and success across Chicago. \nTo draw on the panels introduction and discussion of Civic Innovation, the students transferred to mHUB Chicago where they took part in a Civic Innovation Challenge. Microsoft’s Adam Hecktman was there to see the students at work. \nFor the final day of ThinkChicago , Microsoft Chicago hosted 60 students at our Envisioning Lab for a demo by Adam Hecktman on Machine Learning. Adam introduced the students to AI facial recognition, sentiment analysis, speech to text, and the immeasurable capabilities of emerging technologies. \nMicrosoft Chicago Fellows, Soren Spicknall and Anna Draft (me!), followed up with insights on Microsoft’s Fellowship program. Soren spoke to the group of his work in Data Science and Civic Technology and how both are being applied for social good. I spoke of my work in Public Policy and community engagement and how both are necessary for improving digital literacy and accessibility. Thanks to Microsoft’s Fellowship program, Soren and I have been able to pursue our passions. We have also been able to experience how collaboration (between ourselves on a smaller level, and amongst Microsoft partnerships, on a grander level) drives innovation and success across Chicago. \nBefore the students were set free to experience four full days at Lollapalooza, we concluded with Q&A. The ThinkChicago students were curious, they asked applicable questions, and they were wonderful to connect with. Since ThinkChicago, we have received a number of positive inquiries from the students interested in everything from Civic Innovation, Machine Learning, Data Science, Public Policy, and job opportunities! \nCongratulations, and a very big thank you to Mayor Emanuel, World Business Chicago, the University of Illinois, the amazing panelists, and the students for coming together for ThinkChicago. The City of Chicago is set for success thanks to everyone’s remarkable efforts and dedication. \nFor more information about ThinkChicago, visit thinkchicago.net . Share on:",

      "text": "Arrogant, removed, pampered, and driven, we’ve all read the headlines about CEOs who behave badly. But are a few bad apples spoiling the reputation for the rest of the leaders? We talked to several CEOs who shared the biggest myths employees believe about CEO’s jobs. Here are some details that might help you rethink how you view the person at the top.\nadvertisement 1. CEOs Have Glamorous Lives From private jets to five-star restaurants, CEOs live a life of luxury, right? Not so, says Alex Shootman, CEO of Workfront , a project management software provider. “You are going to stuff a steaming Hot Pocket in your mouth five minutes before a meeting, show up to a lousy hotel at 1 a.m., and work before your family wakes up on Saturday mornings,” he says. “But everyone will think that you are living the high life.”\nThis is especially true at a startup. “You have to grind day in and day out,” adds Jeb Ory, CEO of Phone2Action , a startup that enables citizens to connect with policymakers. “You need to spend your time with clients, learning how they operate and how they use your product. You have to surround yourself with people that are better than you, and you have to create conditions for them to be successful.”\n2. CEOs Are Lonely It’s easy to see why people think CEOs are lonely, says Matthew Schiltz, CEO of the Salesforce app Conga . “There’s only person with the title of CEO—only one employee in the entire organization that doesn’t strictly have a peer group,” he says. “It’s up to the CEO to make everyone feel comfortable around them.”\nBut businesses weren’t meant to be run alone, adds Shannon Miles, co-CEO of BELAY , a virtual workforce provider. “Successful CEOs surround themselves with people who share in their vision and can help execute on it,” she says. “The more open and vulnerable a CEO can be with their peers or colleagues, the less lonely they will be.”\n3. CEOs Have All The Answers Unfortunately, they don’t, says Amanda Lannert, CEO at Jellyvision , an employee communication software provider. “But we have an ability to find the answers through our teams, networks, and research,” she says. “We’ve learned how to learn.”\nThe mark of a good leader can be measured by the strength of the team with which she surrounds herself, adds Talbott Roche, president and CEO of the fintech company Blackhawk Network . CEOs surround themselves with smart people who have levels of expertise. “Successful leaders may also have mentorship relationships that enable them to consult with other leaders on challenges or opportunities facing their company,” she says.\nadvertisement 4. CEOs Earn Millions Each Year Some might, but the reality is most CEOs are fairly compensated based on the size of the company they work in and its industry, says Mark A. Gilmore, CEO and president of Wired Integrations , a Silicon Valley-based technology consulting firm. “Most CEOs make a moderate six figures, but are by no stretch millionaires with endless loads of cash,” he says. “That group is the 1% of the 1% whom we find often in the headlines because of the ridiculous amount of money they make.”\nIn a well-run startup, the CEO often doesn’t make the most money, adds Scott Collison, CEO of the data science firm Continuum Analytics . “The biggest cash earners should be key players in technical and sales positions,” he says.\n5. CEOs Are Workaholics The idea that CEOs have to work 100 hours a week or more isn’t true. “When I cut my hours, my business started to make more money,” says Andrea Goulet, cofounder and CEO of the software-remodeling firm CorgiBytes . “My job as a CEO was not to work the most hours, it was to make the right decisions at the right time. In order to have a clear head and make good decisions, personal health and downtime had to come back.”\nAndrew Newman, CEO and founder of the cybersecurity company Reason Core Security , agrees. “I think it’s vital to unplug at times and reboot,” he says “Outside of the office, when I am not at home with my family, I am an avid snowboarder and black belt in karate. Being able to work out my body and my mind keeps me sharp. When not being extremely active, a little known fact is that I am a Lego collector. Growing up doesn’t mean you have to grow old.”\nCEOs also make time for family, says Seth Birnbaum, CEO and cofounder of EverQuote: , a website that aggregates insurance Quote: s. “The biggest myth I’ve heard is that CEOs are too busy to attend valuable family events,” he says. “I always make time for my family and children. In fact, Halloween is a big deal in my family and I’ve never missed one year of trick-or-treating with my kids.”\n6. CEOs Are Not Approachable Many employees assume that the CEO is withdrawn and rude, says Paul English, cofounder of Kayak and CEO of business travel app Lola .\nadvertisement “You don’t have to be an aggressive jerk,” he says. “I cringe when I think that there might be some young CEOs who think they have to be arrogant to get people to follow them.”\nInstead of being aloof, English believes CEOs should have confidence in their ideas, humility to realize that you will often be wrong, and curiosity around other people’s ideas in solving your customer problems.\n7. CEOs Have No Bosses Employees have remarked about how great it must be to work without a boss, but that’s not true, says Sarah Lahav, CEO of SysAid Technologies , a help desk software provider. “They think you determine the agenda, you decide what to do and when to do it and nobody can tell you what to do. Right? Wrong,” she says. “CEOs do report; they report to the board of directors and shareholders and they have to be accountable for the full company’s performance.”\nIn a sense, the CEO has many other bosses—the employees. “Every move, decision, and communication is being evaluated by the employees since this the way the company performs impacts them directly as employees,” she says.",

CEOs Are Not Approachable Many employees assume that the CEO is withdrawn and rude, says Paul English, cofounder of Kayak and CEO of business travel app Lola .\nadvertisement “You don’t have to be an aggressive jerk,” he says. “I cringe when I think that there might be some young CEOs who think they have to be arrogant to get people to follow them.”\nInstead of being aloof, English believes CEOs should have confidence in their ideas, humility to realize that you will often be wrong, and curiosity around other people’s ideas in solving your customer problems.\n7. CEOs Have No Bosses Employees have remarked about how great it must be to work without a boss, but that’s not true, says Sarah Lahav, CEO of SysAid Technologies , a help desk software provider. “They think you determine the agenda, you decide what to do and when to do it and nobody can tell you what to do. Right? Wrong,” she says. “CEOs do report; they report to the board of directors and shareholders and they have to be accountable for the full company’s performance.”\nIn a sense, the CEO has many other bosses—the employees. “Every move, decision, and communication is being evaluated by the employees since this the way the company performs impacts them directly as employees,” she says.",

      "title": "Growing Up with Alexa",
      "text": "When it comes to digital assistants like Ama zon’s Alexa, my four-year-old niece Hannah Metz is an early adopter. Her family has four puck-like Amazon Echo Dot devices plugged in around her house—including one in her bedroom—that she can use to call on Alexa at any moment.\n“Alexa, play ‘It’s Raining Tacos,’” she commanded on a recent sunny afternoon, and the voice-controlled helper immediately complied, blasting through its speaker a confection of a song with lines like “It’s raining tacos from out of the sky” and “Yum, yum, yum, yum, yumidy yum.”\nGiggling and clapping, Hannah danced around the room. I think this ability to get music on demand is neat, too, and I didn’t want to be rude, so I danced with her. But at the same time I was wondering what it’s going to mean for her to grow up with computers as servants.\nThis story is part of our September/October 2017 Issue See the rest of the issue\nSubscribe The research firm eMarketer estimates that 60.5 million people in the U.S.—a little less than a fifth of the population—will use a digital assistant at least once a month this year, and about 36 million will do so on a speaker-based device like Amazon Echo or Google Home. These things are most popular among people age 25 to 34, which includes a ton of parents of young children and parents-to-be.\nAnd these techno-helpers are not just going to get more popular; they will also get better at responding to queries and orders, and they’ll sound more humanlike, too. At the same time, young users like ­Hannah will become more comfortable and sophisticated with the technology, going beyond telling Alexa to play a song. They’ll request help with homework or control devices around their home.\nIt’s a little worrisome. Leaving aside the privacy implications of kids telling an Internet-connected computer all kinds of things, we don’t know much about how this kind of interaction with artificial intelligence and automation will affect how children behave and what they think about computers. Will they become lazy because it’s so easy to ask Alexa and its peers to do and buy things? Or jerks because many of these interactions compel you to order the technology around? (Or both?)\nChildren in the MIT Media Lab study using a Google Home device. The researchers hope to eventually design such digital agents so that kids will be able to tinker with them. Some of that may happen. It seems more likely, though, that as with many technologies before this, the utility of digital assistants will outweigh their drawbacks. Already they’re making an incredible amount of data and computer-aided capabilities available directly to children—even those not yet in kindergarten—for learning, playing, and communicating. With Alexa, kids can get answers to all kinds of questions (both serious and silly), hear stories, play games, control apps, and turn on the lights even if they can’t yet reach a wall switch. And this is just the beginning of the kiddie AI revolution.\nDoes Alexa have feelings? I wasn’t sure if Hannah knew whether Alexa is human. So I asked, and this is what she told me: Alexa is “a kind of robot” who lives in her house, and robots, she reasoned, aren’t people. But she does think Alexa has feelings, happy and sad. And Hannah says she would feel bad if Alexa went away. Does that mean she has to be nice to Alexa? Yes, she says, but she’s not sure why.\nHer interest in her digital assistant jibes with some findings in a recent MIT study , where researchers looked at how children ages three to 10 interacted with Alexa, Google Home, a tiny game-playing robot called Cozmo , and a smartphone app called Julie Chatbot . The kids in the study determined that the devices were generally friendly and trustworthy, and they asked a range of questions to get to know the technologies (“Hey Alexa, how old are you?”) and figure out how they worked (“Do you have a phone inside you?”).\nCynthia Breazeal, one of the researchers and director of the Personal Robots Group at MIT’s Media Lab (as well as cofounder and chief scientist of the company developing an AI robot called Jibo ), says that it’s not new for children to anthropomorphize technology. But now it’s happening a little differently.\nFor young kids like Hannah who can’t yet read, write, or type but can talk a mile a minute, voice-operated assistants could help build social skills and push boundaries—two things that are key to a child’s development. If nuances in the user’s tone can affect how the digital servants respond—which is not that unlikely in the near future—it’s possible that kids who use them will become more adept at communicating with others (be the others humans or robots).\nThat would be a change from what Breazeal sees today: a lot of bad behavior when we interact with each other using technology. She thinks that arises from the abstract context of, say, tweeting, where we may not fully appreciate the consequences of our interactions. She sees a huge opportunity for virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Home, and others to be designed in ways that push us to treat others the way we want to be treated.\nEven though that isn’t the way Alexa works yet, it is teaching Hannah some things about how to treat machines, at least. Her mom, Susan Metz, tells me that she’s learning there’s a special pattern you have to use when asking Alexa things (you have to say a keyword like “Alexa” first), so she is figuring out that this voice assistant isn’t something you can speak to the way you would a person. Hannah has also learned that she has to be quiet when her mom is talking to Alexa (I can confirm this isn’t carrying over to times that Susan is talking with people). It is possible that simple, routine interactions with this kind of AI will help kids learn even without much advancement in the technology or its design.\nThing reviewed Alexa “Hey Google is it OK if I eat you?’: Initial Explorations in Child-Agent Interaction”\nStefania Druga, Randi Williams, Cynthia Breazeal, and Mitchel Resnick\nProceedings of the 2017 Conference on Interaction Design and Children\nJune 2017 Hannah uses Alexa to find out the time and date. That makes Elizabeth ­Vandewater , director of data science and research services at the University of Texas at Austin’s Population Research Center, wonder if easy access to these assistants will help some kids develop a sense for things like calendar days and minutes sooner than they would have previously. In a way that’s helpful—it’s one less question peppering parents from a talkative kid. And in fact, Susan says she’s happy that Alexa entertains Hannah. But it also brings a sense of robotic precision to life that most of us don’t really have to deal with until we’re older and more independent, entrusted with doing things like getting to school or work on time. Who knows if that’s a good thing?\nSay what? No matter how you’re using these digital butlers, the limits of the technology quickly become apparent. Voice-led interactions can still be difficult even for the clearest-speaking adults, and young kids don’t often enunciate that well.\nHannah had this problem a few times when she asked Alexa to play music from the Disney movie Moana and Alexa had no idea what she was trying to say. ­Hannah responded by doing what a lot of us would do when speaking to someone who can’t understand us: she spoke a lot louder, and slower. It still didn’t work, and Hannah got frustrated.\nHow to fix it? Breazeal and the other MIT researchers suggest that Alexa and similar “agents” could be designed to tell you why they don’t understand what you’re asking or commanding, so you can better determine how to get what you want. This makes a lot of sense, as we’re innately social (and like feedback), and it’s important to learn how to communicate with others in a way that takes their capabilities and levels of understanding into account.\nWhat about older children? Will they get bossy and bratty from the habit of ordering Alexa around? Probably not, says Kaveri Subrahmanyam , a developmental psychologist and chair of child and family studies at California State University, Los Angeles. But she does wonder whether having digital butlers will reduce kids’ ability to do things for themselves. “I don’t think we have to be worried about it or paranoid about it, but I do think it’s something to be watchful for,” she says.\nDo you think digital assistants like Alexa are good for kids? Tell us in the comments. The other researchers I spoke to aren’t too worried either. “There’s this notion that if all this technology was turned off, everything would be great. We’d be interacting all the time, we’d be reading all the time,” Vandewater says. “I just don’t believe that.”\nIn fact, maybe the opposite can be true. Perhaps growing up with Alexa will actually make technology less distracting, enabling it to, in a sense, fade into the background; we’ll get what we need from it, and then move on with our lives until we come back with another request.\nFor Hannah, at least, this seems to be the case for now. She didn’t want to spend much time inside playing with Alexa, and so shortly after we finished dancing to “It’s Raining Tacos,” she ran outside to chase her little brother around the yard.\nHear more about robots\nChildren in the MIT Media Lab study using a Google Home device.

      "text": "If these walls could talk: The architectural history of the White House More stories Northeastern researchers created a framework for downscaling—or zooming in—on historic climate data sets. This allows scientists to make more detailed, localized climate projections, down to the scale of local infrastructure. \nIn the quest to better understand climate change, there is plenty we still don’t know. But the question isn’t whether or not climate change is happening. “What we sometimes hear on the news is political manufactured uncertainty,” said Auroop Ganguly, a professor of civil & environmental engineering at Northeastern. \nInstead, real climate change uncertainty stems from the challenge of simulating the future. What will happen to Boston’s electric grid under long-term extreme weather conditions? How would a power plant in Phoenix be affected by diminishing regional resources? When should Atlanta invest in updating its water infrastructure? \nCurrent models are good at projecting regional trends. But to adequately prepare for the future effects of climate change, scientists need to zoom in on vulnerable locations such as coastal cities, threatened ecosystems, and other specific sites. \nIn a paper presented this week at the Association for Computing Machinery’s conference for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, researchers outlined a new strategy for doing just that. \nThomas Vandal is a doctoral student in civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern and lead author of the paper, which was awarded Runner-Up for Best Paper in the Applied Data Science track. Vandal worked with Evan Kodra, the CEO of Northeastern spinout risQ, and NASA Ames collaborators Sangram Ganguly, Andrew Michaelis, and Ramakrishna Nemani, and his advisor Auroop Ganguly, to develop a system that zooms in on climate data to produce higher resolution projections. \nTeaching artificial brains to learn Simulating climate is an exercise in time travel. In order to predict the future, researchers first have to take stock of the past—in other words, they hindcast before they can forecast. \nVandal visited the NASA Ames Research Center where he collected and analyzed historic climate data sets that measure variables like temperature, rainfall, and geographic elevation, as well as NASA’s extensive satellite data. To wrangle this colossal amount of data, Vandal leveraged a machine at NASA Ames called Pleiades, one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. \nThe team’s goal was to create a framework for downscaling—or zooming in—on historic climate data sets. This would allow scientists to make more detailed, localized climate projections. “Rather than using machine learning to get people to click ads or maximize page views, I decided solving problems in climate science was a better use of my skills and time.” Thomas Vandal Doctoral student in civil & environmental engineering \nThe researchers made use of cutting-edge deep learning technologies. Deep learning is an innovation of artificial neural networks—a computing system based loosely on biological nervous systems. Deep learning allows artificial neural networks to recognize patterns and perform tasks. \nVandal, who joined Northeastern after working for multiple startups in the Boston area, has used a related technology called machine learning in industry for facial expression analysis and emotion recognition. But after meeting Auroop Ganguly, he realized the technology could take a more virtuous path by making a difference in climate science, an area he cares deeply about. \n“Rather than using machine learning to get people to click ads or maximize page views, I decided solving problems in climate science was a better use of my skills and time,” Vandal said. \nThe result of the team’s research is a framework called DeepSD, which stands for deep learning-based statistical downscaling. The system helps bring disparate climate data sets with varying degrees of detail into focus. \n“These downscaled datasets will be of immense value to climate researchers and eco-climatic modelers who want to study anything from the impact of ecosystems to changes in climate for future warming scenarios,” said Sangram Ganguly, one of the study’s co-authors and a senior research scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute at the NASA Ames Research Center. \nAnd this is just the beginning. Vandal believes the DeepSD concept could be used to solve a variety of climate problems, from tracking extreme weather to predicting disaster events with greater confidence. In the world of computer science, the technology is still in its infancy. \n“The computer science field changes really fast,” Auroop Ganguly said. “One year is like a geological age in some other fields.” \nThis research was supported by NASA and three National Science Foundation grants: Big Data, Cyber SEES, and Expeditions in Computing.

      "text": "August 16, 2017 at 8:00 am August 16, 2017 at 8:03 am GeekWire Summit: Early-bird tickets here! \n(Microsoft Image) \nMicrosoft is making a big bet on serverless technologies this year, and it continued that push Wednesday with the release of Azure Event Grid , a new service for managing serverless app development. \nAzure Event Grid is, as the name suggests, centered around “events,” which are a key part of serverless computing. It gives Azure users plunging into serverless computing strategies a better way to manage the complicated sprawl of events across various Azure services, said Corey Sanders, director of Azure Compute. \nServerless computing is based around the idea that developers shouldn’t have to consider hardware infrastructure at all when constructing apps. Instead, they can write applications based around “functions,” which carry out a predetermined sequence of instructions tied to a particular “event.” Events — like when a new piece of content is uploaded to storage, or someone clicks on a link within an app — are the trigger for functions, and app developers can subscribe to events in order to trigger actions within their applications. \nThe key to Azure Event Grid is that it treats the events themselves as a first-class object, Sanders said. That means that events aren’t dependent on other services, which means developers have much more flexibility in terms of how they define and provision events. \n“We think it’s going to be a significant improvement to doing very fast and easy serverless operations,” Sanders said. \nApplications built around the internet of things mindset are very receptive to this development strategy, Sanders said. Consider a sensor placed somewhere in a huge farm: developers can use Azure Event Grid to build serverless farming applications that react to changes in temperature, humidity, or other environmental factors (events) with automated responses, such as changes in the watering cycle, based on relevant criteria. \nThe other big benefit of this development technique is cost. Serverless applications consume computing resources in extremely short bursts, and they can be tracked down to the second, which means you only pay for the computing resources you consume by the second. Other cloud services charge by the hour or minute, which means you can be paying quite a bit of money for resources you only need for a fraction of that interval. \nAmazon Web Services is considered the leader in serverless technology, thanks to the early introduction of Amazon Lambda , but Microsoft has invested a lot of time and money in improving its serverless story this year.

      "text": "16 Aug 2017 | Save | Email | Print | PDF Issued by: Meltwater The fifth deal in Meltwater's ongoing M&A streak adds machine-learning, data-science experts to in-house machine learning team SAN FRANCISCO, Calif - August 15, 2017 - Meltwater, a global leader in media intelligence and data analytics, announced the acquisition of Cosmify, a knowledge discovery platform that uses advanced machine learning technology for in-depth analysis of corporate data sets. Cosmify's technology will help Meltwater's industry-leading platform intelligently manage the vast amounts of data from multiple sources that businesses need to make competitive decisions based on insights from the outside. With its fifth acquisition in less than nine months, Meltwater is quickly building on its impressive data science engine aimed at offering the most innovative and dynamic media intelligence platform in the world. With 55 offices throughout six continents, Meltwater employs more than 1,500 employees and 50% of Fortune 500 companies use its services to shape business decisions. “The best business decisions are based on forward-looking data. Today external data on the open internet is one of the most important sources for forward-looking information,” says Jorn Lyseggen, CEO and founder of Meltwater. “Cosmify's advanced discovery, clustering, and classification capabilities will enhance Meltwater's ability to connect the dots between a wide range of data types from internal and external data and ultimately help business leaders make more informed decisions.”Cosmify founder Eugene Ciurana and chairman Bart Swanson launched their first machine learning company, Summly, with 16-year old founder and Oxford student Nick D'Aloisio, and sold it to Yahoo for $30m in 2013. In 2014, the team, with co-founders Dr. Ana Nelson, Connor Goodwolf, and Sriram Krishnan, launched Cosmify. Bart Swanson of Horizons Ventures, MuleSoft founder Ross Mason, and CA Technologies VP of Engineering Leonid Igolnik are part of the advisory board. Now, after selling two companies in four years, the team is joining Meltwater's push to build the largest AI-driven data repository in the world, giving companies a competitive edge by allowing them to leverage insights from external data when making business decisions. “95% of all data is unstructured and unwieldy, but it also contains a vast trove of unexploited value,” says Eugene Ciurana, CEO and Founder of Cosmify. “Our unsupervised learning system extracts knowledge from internal and external, unstructured data sources like PDFs, free-text, spreadsheets, media files, presentations, cloud drives, calendars, or chat systems - most often hitting on valuable information nuggets that eluded the very users who produced them.”“Cosmify's knowledge discovery engine analyzes customers' very large and dynamic data lakes to produce vectorized information, and when fed into our existing Data Science platform, automates generation of highly customised outside insights - all without having to import their internal data into our systems,” says Aditya Jami, Senior Director of Engineering & Head of AI at Meltwater.The acquisition of Cosmify comes on the heels of several key acquisitions for Meltwater that have broadened its global footprint and cemented the company's commitment to data science and machine learning. Meltwater recently announced its plans to acquire Canada's Infomart, followed closely by Hong Kong-based social big data SaaS solution Klarity. Earlier this year, it acquired Oxford University spinout, Wrapidity, to add AI-based crawling to Meltwater's platform and last year, Meltwater acquired Encore Alerts, a US-based data science driven media monitoring company. Meltwater is actively seeking investment opportunities and partnerships to continue expanding its media intelligence services globally, with a strong emphasis on data science.",

      "text": "THE BLOG The World Needs More Coders Than Newspaper Columnists We need people capable of extracting and interpreting information from mounds of data to make smart decisions. 08/16/2017 14:03 EDT | Updated 18 hours ago Murtaza Haider Associate Professor, Ted Rogers School of Management, Ryerson University. Author of Getting Started with Data Science ADVERTISEMENT \nHad they tried, even the Luddites could not have more enthusiastically opposed teaching coding and programming to the Canadian youth than Globe and Mail columnist Margaret Wente. \nMs. Wente argued that computer code \"is irrelevant for most of us\" and that \"[c]oding is a valuable skill — for maybe two per cent of the labour force,\" and hence no need to teach computer programming to school-going children in Canada, which is a priority of the federal Liberals . \nAcross the globe, schools teach mathematics and literature to students not because students are expected to become Fields Medal -winning mathematicians or Booker Prize-winning authors. We teach math and literature to children because we recognize numeracy and good writing as life skills. \nIn the not-so-distant future, coding and programming will also be life skills and hence the need to teach the same to Canadian children to maintain the competitive advantage of the Canadian economy. Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press Prime Minister Justin Trudeau talks with grade 7 student Isabel Clement, 12, of D.A. Aubrey Intermediate as they take part in an Hour of Code event at Shopify in Ottawa, Ont. on Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. \nIn the past 10 years or so, our lives have become quite data centric. Individuals, corporations, governments, and even the ordinary daily-use machines are all generating data at an unprecedented pace. \nThe shortage, therefore, is not of data storage devices or algorithms to mine huge amounts of data. Instead, the current and future shortages are and will be of workers and managers capable of extracting and interpreting information from mounds of data to make smart decisions. This will inevitably require some coding expertise. \nIn my book, Getting Started with Data Science : Making Sense of Data with Analytics , I explain how the nature of work is changing where data and coding-literate workers and managers will become the driving force for generating value. I offer several examples of studies and opinions of hiring managers at big businesses, such as Google and Walmart, who point out the acute shortage of numerate workers and business leaders. Canada's big data talent gap \nIn a widely cited report, the McKinsey Global Institute alerted businesses and governments globally to the impending shortfall in the talent necessary for knowledge-based economies to take advantage of efficiencies made possible by big data analytics, which relies on coding and programming. The report highlighted that by 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 professionals with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions. \nThe situation in Canada is not much different. Recently, Statistics Canada revealed that just three per cent of the total post-secondary enrollment (university and college) in 2016 were in mathematics, computer, and information sciences. \nFurthermore, a white paper released by Canada's Big Data Consortium titled \"Canada's Big Data Talent Gap,\" highlighted the shortage of professionals with data science and analytical skills. The cause of this shortage was identified as a lack of sufficient training opportunities related to big data, analytics, and ultimately coding. \nAlex Usher, Ms. Wente's go-to consultant on higher education, is rather confused about what coding and programming mean. Mr. Usher, quoted in the Globe, believes that digital literacy and proficiency does not involve writing software, but \"it is the ability to apply and use software productively.\" With the rapidly changing world of computer programming, sometimes a 10-line code written in R, Python or Julia could save hundreds of hours in productivity and millions of dollars in costs. \nHere lies the problem. Ms. Wente and Mr. Usher believe that someone in Canada or China will always be there to write the code for their analytics needs. Their approach will increase Canada's dependency on foreign talent, given the insufficient enrollment in STEM disciplines in Canada. \nThey also fail to understand that coding and programming do not imply creating comprehensive software applications. With the rapidly changing world of computer programming, sometimes a 10-line code written in R , Python or Julia could save hundreds of hours in productivity and millions of dollars in costs. \nFortunately for Canada, school boards and big corporations like IBM are not listening to Ms. Wente, who seldom misses an opportunity to question the utility of higher education or the work ethics of teachers . \nAt the St. Luke Catholic Elementary School in Mississauga, Ont., for instance, children as young as four are already being introduced to data and analytics. The kindergarten students created the pictogram (histogram in statistics speak) below to visualize the mode of transport used by students to access their school. Their future education must include coding and programming. AOL \nConsider a Canadian initiative, the STEM Fellowship , which teaches middle and high school students computing and programming for data analytics. While working with IBM Canada and others, the STEM Fellowship provides extracurricular training opportunities to prepare students in Canada for the world where coding and programming will be as essential as knowing basic maths. \nWhile working with IBM's Cognitive Class initiative , I (along with many others) am developing free training in data science and analytics (coding for Ms. Wente) to prepare today's and tomorrow's workers to be productive and competitive. I am certain that the world will need more coders than university professors or newspapers columnists in the future. \nThe federal Liberals have the foresight to invest in the skills demanded by current and future workplaces. CanCode is a $50-million initiative to provide \"educational opportunities for coding and digital skills development to Canadian youth from kindergarten to grade 12.\" I believe $50 million is, in fact, not enough given the future demand for such skills. \nWe should be asking the government to invest more in preparing the Canadian youth for the future labour force rather than being Luddites and opposing new technology that has the potential to create prosperity and a better future for all. \nAlso on HuffPost:",

      "text": "Toyota And Servco Pacific Inc. Pilot Test New Car Share Application English USA - español New suite of software and services designed to enable dealers and distributors to launch car share programs in local marketsServco will launch a car share business built on Toyota's Mobility Services Platform in Honolulu, Hawaii by end of 2017   15:00   \nPLANO, Texas , Aug. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Toyota and Servco Pacific Inc. (Servco) have partnered to test a new car-sharing technology in Honolulu, Hawaii . The suite of software and services is an important part of Toyota's Mobility Services Platform (MSPF) which will offer various functions to enable a more convenient mobility experience. When the employee-only pilot testing program concludes, Servco, the distributor of Toyota vehicles in Hawaii , will use the car-sharing technology to launch a new Honolulu -based car share business by the end of 2017. Toyota and Servco Pacific Inc. have partnered to test a new car-sharing technology in Honolulu, Hawaii. An example of the pilot test program’s mobile application screen is shown here. \nThe car-sharing application will support driver identification and authentication, plus payment and fleet management for car-sharing businesses. It also includes a Smart Key Box (SKB), which lets users lock and unlock vehicles via a smartphone. The application was developed in-house and is managed by Toyota Connected North America (TC), the global technology strategy business unit for Toyota. \n\"This new application demonstrates the power of combining Toyota's unrivaled global manufacturing and technology capacity with dealers' extensive local operations to provide consumers with more convenient options to move,\" said Shigeki Tomoyama, President of Connected Company, Toyota Motor Corporation. \n\"This successful launch of the MSPF represents the next generation in car-sharing platforms and is Toyota's global foundation for fleet management, car-sharing, and the future of mobility,\" said Zack Hicks , CEO of Toyota Connected North America. \"Its powerful and flexible API based platform allows us to quickly adapt to new market opportunities and support deployment of locally-tailored mobility services.\" \nSince January 2017 , Toyota has been working with Getaround on the car-sharing pilot program in San Francisco, Calif. , verifying convenience and usability of the SKB. Thanks to the pilot test with Servco, Toyota continues to enhance the car-sharing application and MSPF, which seeks to leverage the power of connected vehicle systems to support new mobility businesses. Eventually, Toyota will also begin working with other dealers and distributors to tailor the core technology for their markets, aiming for safe and more convenient, customer-centric mobility services. \nLaunched in 2016, TC was created to significantly expand Toyota's capabilities in the fields of vehicle data science, machine learning, and contextual data services development, and provides a wide range of data and computer science services across Toyota's global operations. \nMedia Contacts:",

      "text": "No matter your introduction to pornfinding a stack of dirty mags in the back of dad's closet, a furtive group viewing of Girls Gone Wild at a pal's sleepoverit's a formative experience. How formative, and how porn might later shape our behavior, attitudes and preferences, are questions that have been haranguing researchers for decades.\n\nThe answer, should you try to find it yourself, seems to be smeared all over the Internet in the form of \"this is your brain on porn\"-style headlines: porn is bad for your brain , porn kills your friendships and your boner , porn overloads your frontal lobe with heady rushes of pleasure-jolting dopamine . (Side note: in reality, dopamine doesn't really work that way ). Hell, porn even taunts John Mayer's orgasms . \nDoes it turn naive young boys into strapping misogynist men, too? \nRecently, a team of doctoral candidates at the University of NebraskaLincoln presented the findings of a study that examines the links between the age at which men first experience porn (specifically online) and, later in life, their attitudes toward women. The team surveyed roughly 300 male undergraduate students, mostly white and heterosexual (84.9 percent white, 92.6 percent hetero) at the university about their early porn exposure and the nature of the encounter (i.e., whether it was accidental, intentional or forced), then asked each participant to complete a questionnaire that measures how closely men conform to certain \"norms\" of masculinity, such as the desire to seek power over women or the pursuit of status, which the Conformity of Masculine Norms Index (CMNI) defines as \"being pleased with being thought of as important.\"\nTheir data revealed that participants who reported a younger age of exposure were more likely to seek power over women, based on their answers to the survey, which defines that behavior as \"perceived control over women at both personal and social levels.\" Meanwhile, participants first exposed to porn later in life were more likely to exhibit promiscuous \"playboy\" behavior, defined by the inventory as \"desire for multiple or non-committed sexual relationships and emotional distance from sex partners.\" In essence: the younger you watch porn, the more likely you are to be an asshole to women. Is it really that simple?\nNot exactly. \nMedia is typically thirsty to take this kind of data and run with it . But claims that porn causes misogyny, or that \"boys who watch porn are more likely to become misogynists,\" are pretty blatant distortions of what this data really represents. Take it from the researchers themselves: \"Because it's not a causal relationship, we can't say which one came first,\" says Christina Richardson, a UNL doctorate candidate on the team that conducted the study. \nYet, when it comes to studying porn, we nonscientific lay-people are horny for conclusions. \"Porn is a lightning rod for our curiosities as a culture and our anxieties around sexuality,\" says Shira Tarrant, gender and sexuality studies expert, author, and noted porn researcher . \"That's part of what I see in the attention studies get, even when it's preliminary data.\" Which, she cautions, this study is. Data, yes; a tiny step forward toward a better understanding, yes. But it's not proof porn causes misogyny. \nResearch that relies on self-reported data can be problematic, Tarrant goes on to explain, especially when it comes to culturally loaded, baggage-laden topics like sex and gender: the answers are simply less reliable. Plus, as both Richardson and Tarrant point out, there are plenty of other variables to consider in the relationship between porn exposure and later gender behaviors: did they grow up with religion? How were they raised, ideologically? What was their sex education like, if any? \"There are so many other things that factor into how we understand ourselves or form our gender identities, and all those other things can also impact how a teen boy might experience exposure to pornography,\" Tarrant says. \nWhile the results of the University of NebraskaLincoln's study are by no means conclusive, they still represent a teeny-tiny step forward. Richardson says that, in addition to reinforcing some theories, the data also could have interesting implications for sexual assault prevention, especially since the quality and content of sex ed in the U.S. is basically a geographical crapshoot . \"The average age at first exposure in our group was 13,\" she explains. \"So at 13, if pornography is the only way that you're getting any messages about sexuality, maybe we could supplement that with more balanced views, or we could prevent that from being the only message that they're getting, if it is leading to some more problematic beliefs.\"\nPorn is an object of lurid fascination in popular science, but based on my conversations with researchers, from their perspective it's a morass of uncertainty, flimsy claims, and, like this University of NebraskaLincoln study, small sample sizes. The psychological, sociological, and physiological implications and long-term effects of porn consumption have been an area of interest for decades, but the research itself is notoriously fuzzy. Add to that the social taboo surrounding porn, and it gets messy. \"The way researchers define [porn] can often depend on their political perspectives to start out with; what kind of content they find alarming,\" Tarrant explains. \nZachary Bloom, an assistant professor in Northeastern Illinois University's Department of Counselor Education, describes the field of pornography research as \"riddled with limitations,\" citing methodology variables, differing definitions of pornography, and a lack of any uniform way to quantify porn exposure. \"Interest in pornography as a research agenda is still gaining momentum from where it was before the widespread use of the internet, and researchers are limited in the array of instruments that have to measure constructs related to pornography exposure which, again, makes it difficult to draw conclusions when comparing studies,\" he says. \"We can find trends in the extant research on pornography exposure and use, but conclusions need to be treated with skepticism.\" Most of the research published to dateincluding this new datashows mutual relationships, not necessarily evidence of cause-and-effect. \nSimply put, scholars still aren't sure of the extent to which porn shapes our brains and behaviors. But, with every scrap of data, science nudges a millimeter forward toward a better understanding of how porn molds us into the people we become. \n\"That's what knowledge is; that's what science does,\" Tarrant says. \"Someone who works in their lab for 20 years and moves like an inch closer to understanding the phenomenon it's not the final word, but it's a step in the constructive direction.\" \nFollow Gray Chapman on Twitter .",

      "text": "Analysis The PyBay 2017 conference, held in San Francisco over the weekend, began with a keynote about concurrency.\nThough hardly a draw for a general interest audience, the topic – an examination of multithreaded and multiprocess programming techniques – turns out to be central to the future of Python.\nSince 2008, the Python community has tried to reconcile incompatibility between Python 2 and newly introduced Python 3.\nFor years, adoption of Python 3 was slow and some even dared to suggest Python didn't have a future. As late as last year, Zed Shaw, an accomplished developer and author of the popular Learn Python the Hard Way , even ventured to opine , \"There is a high probability that Python 3 is such a failure it will kill Python.\"\nDespite these unsubstantiated odds, Shaw – a polarizing figure for some Pythonistas – this year released a version of his book for Python 3.\nPython remains one of the most popular programming languages. It ranked first in IEEE Spectrum's top programming languages for 2017 , third in Redmonk's June 2017 ranking , and fifth in Tiobe's August index . And it continues to be recommended for those new to writing code.\nIt might even be argued that Python is resurgent, thanks to its utility for data science and machine learning projects. Now that almost all the popular Python packages have been ported to Python 3, doubts about the language have receded into the background.\nBut there's a counterpoint. JavaScript is also exceedingly popular, more so than Python by Redmonk's measure. And it has some advantages when dealing with browsers and interfaces. In April, Stanford began testing a version of its introductory programming course taught in JavaScript instead of Java.\nPython and JavaScript are widely used in part because they're easier to pick up than Java, C, C++, and C#. Both have active communities that write and maintain a large number of libraries. And neither has a strong corporate affiliation, the way Java has with Oracle, C# has with Microsoft, and Swift has with Apple.\nIt's too simplistic to say that the two languages are competing with one another, but there's some of that, particularly now that Python is focusing on event-driven programming.\nIn his keynote , Python core developer, consultant and educator Raymond Hettinger outlined the advantages and disadvantages of threads and processes for implementing concurrency in programs.\nConcurrency is important, he said, because it's how the real world operates. Things don't always happen in a predictable sequence.\nCode that implements concurrency can handle multiple tasks that complete at different times. It's essential for writing applications that scale and it remains an area of active discussion among Python programmers.\nLast December, Python version 3.6 arrived, bringing with it non-provisional support for the asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4. The module provides a mechanism for writing single-threaded concurrent code.\n\"It's insanely difficult to get large multi-threaded programs correct,\" Hettinger explained. \"For complex systems, async is much easier to get right than threads with locks.\"",

      "text": "The SEO Primer to Learning Data Science Basics 623 READS \nFor years, SEOs have faced multiple paths when it comes to career development options. \nFor some, the general options involving web development or traditional marketing roles have dominated the conversation, leaving out the data wonks out in the cold. \nWhile there’s a massive benefit in mastering Excel for SEO , you may want to complement your current career with something a bit more challenging like data science. \nLet’s dive into the basics of understanding how data science works for a search marketer’s workflow and how using R can help you on your career development path. First Things First: The Basics Always Matter \nIt’s one thing to be able to copy and paste code and run scripts – many of the greats began their career that way by deconstructing pre-existing work and learning along the way. But in order to level up to greatness with data science, you’ll need to focus on the whole package over time. \nThe three big supporting avenues I recommend dedicating time to include the following, which we’ll discuss as we go along: Statistics: Why all data isn’t created equal. Analytics: How to use Google Analytics and general analytics platforms. Tools and Support: Understanding how clean code, version control, and being able to explore the greater community of those who’ve been in your position before and seek advice. \nRemember: When it comes to learning something as monumental as data science, take it one step at a time and enjoy the ride. \nNow, in order to begin basic data science principles, let’s cover general guidelines that you’ll want to master over time. Understanding How Data Visualization Works \nData visualization is exactly just that: being able to show the data in a way that speaks volumes in a visual manner. \nWith Google Analytics, many SEO professionals use the traditional line chart to explore data for insights and communicate to clients the cause and effect associated. \nLine charts, however, are horrible at showing relative proportions (as opposed to pie charts) or comparing data (as opposed to bar charts). Knowing this, in general, is critical in our line of work. \nFar too often, conveying a simple message turns into wasted effort in having to verbally explain the situation when a proper chart could have done it in seconds. \nFor data visualization in R, I recommend installing the ggplot2 package first. When learning ggplot2, not only do you receive the benefit of working with a structurally sound syntax, but you also have the added benefit of learning about visualization principles simply by coding. Why Is Data Visualization Important for SEO? \nSimply put, if you can’t visually speak to the site’s performance, be prepared to vocally speak to the confusion and objections. \nData visualization is nothing new to a search marketer. On a daily basis, we deal with pie charts, line charts, and on occasion, let out a collective groan when we try and explain to a client or a colleague the merits of scatter plots. \nUnderstanding when to use a specific chart or graph is quite simple once you get the gist of why each one has its benefits in communicating the story clearly. Data Wrangling – Collection, Transforming, and Getting ‘Tidy’ \nThe best part about beginning to understand the basics of data scientist as an SEO is that you likely have access to an exorbitant amount of data at your fingertips. \nBeing able to draw from Google Analytics, Google Search Console, YouTube, Twitter, and even Spotify can be a blessing, but given the different processes that require each data pull, being able to align multiple streams in a manner that remain accurate, relevant, and free of “bugs” can make or break both trust and any decisions that come from the data. \nBut let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Before we report, we’ll need to follow these general steps: 1. Collecting Data \nUsing a tool like R and RStudio, we can pull in data from a number of sources using pre-made packages developed for integration with Google tools such as Search Console, Analytics, AdWords, and even Sheets. But it doesn’t stop there! \nIf you have access to a database such as CloudSQL, PostgreSQL or MySQL, there’s a package for you too. \nOdds are, anything that you can dream of collecting, it can be done using R. \nOnce you’ve imported your data, now it’s time to turn it into something useful, in a format that works for your needs. 2. Transforming Data \nOnce you’ve imported your data, now it’s time to sort it all out in a manner that tells the story. Using the dplyr and tidyr packages, you can filter, arrange, select, and group large segments of data with relative ease. \nOf course, this can also be done with your favorite analytics package of choice, but what about cases where you’d like to compare keyword data from BrightEdge or Nozzle with Google Search Console, Analytics, and AdWords? How about also throwing in CRM data from a database? \nThis is where data science and R shines. Optional: Storing Your Data \nIf you’re finding that the amount of data that you’re handling is simply eating up your local storage, or you’re having trouble sharing your data with others, you’ll need to think about storage. Fortunately, there are packages for these problems as well! \nSome of the well-known options for this include: BigQuery via the bigQueryR package, which is both fast and relatively cheap for handling data by the TB. Google Cloud Storage via the googleCloudStorageR package, which is ideal for situations where integration with other Google Cloud applications are a concern. 3. Showcasing Your Data \nNow that you have the data processed and where you want it, how can you deliver it to the intended recipient? Fortunately, you have a number of options for output based on the use case: Shiny Scheduled emails Why Is Data Manipulation Important for SEO? \nThink about data manipulation as a muscle that many SEOs often fail to develop. For many of us, we’ve had it easy, allowing tools such as Conductor or BrightEdge to do the integrations for us and provide us with on-demand reporting solutions. \nHowever, we often have to settle on which data sources to speak to and how, consequently struggling to tell the entire story. \nBecause we now have the knowledge that anything can be reported on and combined using proper data manipulation steps, being able to speak to the entire customer journey in full detail is made much easier once you get the hang of it. Go Back to School: Fall in Love with Statistics \nBefore you throw your hands up in defeat, hear me out. \nUnderstanding Statistics isn’t imperative when you’re first learning how to work with a programming language or even collecting data. However, if you want to be the data analyst who can tell the story both concisely and accurately, you’re going to need to learn statistics. Why Is Statistics Important for SEO? \nTake a deep breath and really think about that question for just a second. \nStatistics is important, period! \nIf you’ve spent any amount of time in a digital marketing environment, you’ve likely witnessed skewed data in action. \nImagine that you have a client report in front of you for the previous month, and you’d like to speak to the site’s organic search performance as it pertains to end-user acquisition . You find that the time period shows a massive spike in both organic traffic and impressions, and you’d like to take credit for this amazing month-over-month turnaround: \n“We saw a 4 percent increase in organic traffic when looking at year-over-year performance for organic search, but more impressive is the 77 percent uptick in November versus October, which was also up nicely from September! Because weekly traffic shot up in late November, we expect this to continue into December because we survived Google’s recent algorithm update…” \nNow imagine that the client is an e-commerce in the retail industry, and it’s early December. By reporting on their website’s November performance at face value, you’ve created a false narrative to the client built upon unreasonable expectations, failing to understand how negative skew can shape data trends without also speaking to distribution. \nBy being able to understand how mean, median, and mode can throw off face-value data and how the distribution of data being collected (along with the marketing brain telling you that an e-commerce taking part in Cyber Monday deals may see an uptick not because of you, but because of the calendar) will all have a hand in telling the story with fidelity. \nIn short: Nobody wants to have corrupted data, but even fewer would want to act upon the lessons learned from it. R vs Python: Pick a Side and Stick with It (For Now) \nAmong the first things you’ll discover on your path to becoming a data science is the analysis paralysis that’ll come if you haven’t yet picked a programming language to center your efforts on. \nBoth R and Python frequently appear in the data science discussion, but for this exercise, let’s focus on R’s usage: Why Use R as Your Language? \nWhile R has a steep learning curve, once you get the hang of it, it’s quite a breeze to use. For the experienced programmer, learning R shouldn’t be much of a chore. \nWhen it comes to data analysis, both R and Python can handle the task. Python takes advantages of a number of IDEs and libraries that take advantage of a general-purpose programming language (versus R, which is often seen as a “math language”). \nBoth come with strong support generated from its worldwide users and documentation notes, and while adoption rates favor Python, R usage continues to grow among a broad range of industries and data scientists. \nThat being said, R is: Easy to contribute to, with a huge number of packages that can be installed with a single line of code. Easier for beginners to perform exploratory work, even without the use of additional packages. By itself, not ideal for sharing work online, but using the R-based framework Shiny tips the scales in R’s favor. Ideal for heavy statistical analysis and math needs. A Simple Exercise Using R to Display Search Console Data \nLet’s put some of this knowledge to use. Follow along and I’ll explain the thought process behind each step: \nFirst, you’ll need to download and install R . Follow the steps and go with the recommended install steps if this is your first time. \nNext, I highly recommend doing the same with RStudio . This is the IDE that you’ll be working out of, and it requires an installation of R to function. \nNow that you’ve got those two running, launch RStudio and install the following packages, hitting Enter after each line, where you should see a success message for each: \ninstall.packages(\"searchConsoleR\") \ninstall.packages(\"googleAuthR\") \nWith searchConsoleR , this is the package where we can interface R with GSC. googleAuthR is the Google API client that authenticates you with your data. \nOnce both packages are installed, now it’s time to load the libraries, one at a time: \nlibrary(googleAuthR) library(searchConsoleR) \nYou’ll know they’ve loaded if you don’t see any error messages (and a new line appears). Now it’s time to authenticate with Google! Enter the following line, and you should have a browser window open: \nscr_auth() \nVerify the user that has access to the Search Console property that you’ll work with. Now, let’s see which properties that you have access to via Search Console: \nsc_websites <- list_websites() \nYou’ve just assigned the entire list of properties to the sc_websites variable! Run the variable and see if your properties appear: \nsc_websites \nIf you did it correctly, you should see all of your properties – verified and unverified – all listed. \nNow, let’s pick one and run a basic query, where we can download the top 20 rows of queries for each page during the month of June 2017, for United States mobile web search: \nusa_site_queries <- ",

      "text": "NYU Team Designs New Protein for Regenerative Medicine Posted August 16th, 2017 Print \nJin Kim Montclare, Associate Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering \nOne of the major challenges in regenerative medicine — replacing diseased tissues and coaxing those that are damaged to regrow — is designing targeted therapies that deliver the equivalent of molecular scaffolding and cellular construction crews to affected tissues, while allowing doctors to “see” and monitor where and how well these molecular care packages are being delivered. \nJin Kim Montclare , Associate Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, is leading a team that is well on its way to building these biosynthetic materials that can deliver drug therapy or tissue engineering to a damaged area and non-invasively visualize the biomaterial amidst cells and tissue. \nWith the support of a National Science Foundation grant valued at $1,585,544, the researchers, including NYU Center for Data Science ’s Director Richard Bonneau and NYU School of Medicine Associate Professor Youssef Zaim Wadghiri , are adding an imaging component to a self-assembling macromolecule, a so-called “coiled-coil” microfiber that has the structural and molecular properties of naturally occurring self-assembling proteins and that can easily bind and carry molecules like curcumin and doxorubicin. \nThe team plans to tag these intricately coiled microfibers with the element fluorine (which can be used as a tracer in MRI studies) and iron oxide nano-particles (a magnetic contrast agent also used to enhance MRI imaging). \nUsing data collected from fully characterized proteins and initial experiments, the researchers will employ the open source software suite Rosetta, which includes algorithms for computational modeling and analysis of protein structures, to help predict protein folding architecture. \nIn addition to contributing to the field of regenerative medicine, Montclare is making it her mission to attract other women to the world of STEM: Under NYU’s Scientific Outreach and Research program (SOAR), founded by Montclare, undergraduates will be hired to teach the high school students of the Urban Assembly Institute for Math and Science for Young Women (UAI) about the biomaterials and biomedical imaging that are a part of this research project.",

A trained journalist, she shares information that engages brands meaningfully with technology they’ve purchased, so they can achieve higher ROI. With more than 20 years of experience in strategic communications, technology marketing, product launches and events, Nanette is Bronto’s senior product marketing analyst. Nanette George, Senior Product Marketing Analyst \nWhat’s the difference between data science and data analytics? A focus on what’s good for customers – both internal and external, says Mike Zhang, VP of Commerce, Digital Marketing and Innovation at Land’s End. \nIn his IRCE session, More Than Analytics—How Data Science Drives Personalization, Profit and Innovation , Mike Zhang defined common data buzzwords like data science and machine learning. He also outlined six steps to incorporating smart use of data into your commerce marketing program. \nZhang shared a story about Netflix, which held a data-science competition with a $1-million grand prize. Netflix wanted an algorithm that could produce better recommendations for the movies individual users would enjoy. After a three-year competition during which thousands of teams competed, two teams wrote algorithms that increased user conversion by more than 10%, and the team that submitted its entry first won the grand prize. \nThe problem was, after the competition, Netflix couldn’t use the algorithm. They couldn’t reproduce it within the confines of their existing software system. The solution didn’t work for the internal customers, and so in the end, it didn’t work for the brand’s external customers. \nZhang’s definition of some of the latest data buzzwords: Data analysis – Analysis of data using humans or technology. Data science – Using mathematics, statistics and computer science to analyze data. Solutions must be capable of system application. Big data – Data must have the four Vs to be considered big data: high volume, velocity (speed of data coming in or out), high variety (voice, image, text data), and veracity (accuracy). Machine learning – A computer’s ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so. ML offers both a look back and a look ahead, with a bigger focus on prediction of future actions. Google search results, Netflix recommendations, facial recognition and voice recognition are all powered by machine learning. Natural language processing – A computer’s ability to understand speech, by voice or by text. \nAfter distinguishing between the industry terms related to data and the processing of it, Zhang shared these six steps to using data science to open new paths to success for your brand: Rally your organization. Like all changes, there are people who have bought in and those you still have yet to enroll in your idea to apply data science to your marketing program. Champion the cause, and get like-minded team members on board. Identify your resources. You have hidden data scientists in your organization. Most of us didn’t graduate as a data scientist – but we can learn. Encourage them to train themselves so they can assist the brand’s data-science work. Don’t be intimidated by lack of personnel or expertise. There is a lot of talent available in the data-science field. You don’t have to hire a full-time employee to manage your program. Deliver quick wins. Use customer data to understand your biggest challenges. Those are the ones you should go after with data science. Do your homework. Don’t believe every vendor who tells you they are a “machine-learning company.” Do some digging. Things change fast, so as you’re looking for tools, find tools with the flexibility to work with your system over the long term. Build a repeatable process. Tools don’t solve the problem – it’s how you think about the problem that ultimately will make a difference in your bottom line. Smart use of data doesn’t happen overnight. Take your time to build a process that works internally and delivers results you can use externally. \nZhang shared the story of a fashion retailer that started in 2010 as a pure ecommerce company, where the majority of the business was driven by brick-and-mortar locations. The company used over 129 variables to track the customer experience online and offline. Then, they used the data to determine where to expand their locations and to understand differences among customers across geographic areas, to predict shoppers’ propensity to purchase and their affinity for the brand’s products. \n“Do what’s right for your customers, and you don’t have to worry about your company,” Zhang said. With our access to more data now than ever before, he said, you have more opportunity to apply data to your marketing program to transform the customer experience with your brand. \nAnalytics are crucial to every business, but smart data use – leveraging data science – opens new paths to success in fashion and apparel. Data science can heighten the shopping experience through real-time personalization by anticipating shopper’s intentions. Use these tips to get started, begin testing and learn so you can achieve a competitive advantage in customer experience with data science.",

      "text": "Tracie White on August 16, 2017 \nWhen I woke up from minor knee surgery a couple of years ago, the nurse asked me if I wanted morphine. I didn’t know there were several non-opioid options for pain relief like acupuncture or something called electrotherapy. And what about cryotherapy? Could any of these be used to at least reduce the amount of morphine needed to control the pain? \nIn a new study published in JAMA Surgery , researchers examined the most commonly used non-pharmaceutical pain management therapies following knee replacement surgery to see if they did indeed work to reduced pain or opioid use while the patient was in the hospital. They found that acupuncture and electrotherapy could reduce and delay opioid use. \n“Opioid addiction is a national crisis and surgery is now identified as a possible avenue for addiction,” said Tina Hernandez-Boussard , PhD, associate professor of medicine, biomedical data science and surgery at Stanford and senior author of the study. \nIt is important to recognize effective alternatives to standard pharmacological therapy, which remains the first option for treatment, she said. \nBy conducting a meta-analysis of the literature, she and her colleagues identified 39 randomized clinical trials which included 2,391 patients. They then identified five non-drug pain therapies most commonly used after total knee replacement surgery to reduce pain. \nThose therapies included acupuncture, the Chinese practice of inserting needles at specific points in the skin, and cryotherapy, the use of extreme cold such as applying ice packs to the surgical site immediately following surgery. The other three therapies commonly used were preoperative exercise; electrotherapy, using electricity to minimize the perception of pain; and continuous passive motion (CPM), which uses a machine to provide regular movement to the knee immediately after surgery. \nStudy results showed moderate evidence that acupuncture and electrotherapy improved postoperative pain management and reduced opioid consumption. There was also weak evidence that cryotherapy reduced opioid consumption, but no evidence that it improves perceived pain. The findings suggested that CPM and preoperative exercise do not help alleviate pain or reduce opioid consumption. \nHernandez-Boussard stressed that the study examined only one type of surgery and only during that acute phase of pain immediately following surgery. \nShe urged patients to educate themselves about some of these therapies prior to surgery and to talk to their surgeon about the therapies’ possible benefits in advance, which could be beneficial to recovery in the long term — which I will do if I ever have to return to the surgery table. \n“The informed patient really has a lot of options,” Hernandez-Boussard said.",

      "text": "A protester sits on the statue of Vladimir Lenin in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood on Wednesday. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) A handful of self-described supporters of President Donald Trump converged on Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood Wednesday to call for the removal of a statue of Russian Communist revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin that has stood in the neighborhood for 22 years.\nProtesters Wednesday wore Make America Great Again hats and held signs that said “Lenin = Hitler,” “100 Million Dead” and “Alt-Left Hate,” and they chanted slogans such as “Shame on Seattle,” “Tear hate down,” and “Genocide is not a joke” at passing cars and people grabbing lunch in the arty, tech-heavy neighborhood. Fremont is home to offices of such tech companies as Google, Adobe, Tableau, Outreach and Pixvana.\nThe protest comes in response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend during a rally around a statue there of Civil War Gen. Robert E. Lee, and the subsequent removal of Confederate statues in other cities.\nWell-known Silicon Valley venture capitalist Benedict Evans called attention on Twitter on Tuesday to the supposed irony of the Lenin statue standing in left-leaning Seattle, drawing fresh attention to the long-controversial sculpture.\nOne protester climbed atop the statue as others live-streamed their sometimes heated debates with anyone willing to engage with them on the walk past the 16-foot tall bronze sculpture in the center of the neighborhood.\nJack Posobieck , a well-known internet activist and political advocate for Citizens for Trump , stood below the statue wearing a red MAGA T-shirt. He said he flew into Seattle from Washington, D.C., Wednesday morning specifically to protest Lenin, and he chronicled the action on Twitter in a self-styled news report .\nJack Posobieck, a political activist from Washington, D.C., helped organize a small rally at the Lenin statue. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) Posobieck said it was his first time in Seattle and he called it a beautiful city. He said he had not heard of the Lenin statue before this week and came to Seattle after plans to march on Google — over the firing of software engineer James Damore — were scrapped. The small group organized on social media.\n“We were looking to do something this week and we saw this statue that was here and we said, “Hey, if we’re going to be tearing down statues, here’s one that should be on the list.'”\nPosobieck said ultimately the goal is to get the privately owned statue torn down.\n“Obviously today, logistically, it’s not going to happen,” Posobieck said, as two Seattle Police Department officers showed up to observe the protest from across the street. “But we’d like to start a movement, really following in the footsteps of the movement that is talking about tearing down statues that are associated with hatred and bigotry in the United States. That’s clearly what this statue is also associated with and so we believe that this one should also be torn down.”\nPosobieck said he had no plans to be in Fremont beyond Wednesday, but said others from the group would.\nProtesters debate with some passersby in front of the Lenin statue in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) Andy Barr , another protester who said he was from Seattle and works in tech, is an organizer for a meetup group called Seattle Patriots for Trump whose goal, according to its website, is to “turn Washington state red again.”\nBarr, who works in data science, told GeekWire that he was “one of the very few people who are out, in tech, open supporters of the president,” who worked to get Trump elected and still support him. He said there is a “culture of fear” among Trump supporters in tech based on the potential for backlash over that support.\nBarr said he was mainly attending Wednesday’s protest to point out the double standard around the actions of Lenin and his statue “standing in Seattle,” and the Confederate statues being torn down elsewhere. He likes the idea of “market forces” determining what happens to the statue, which is reportedly for sale for as much as $250,000.\n“I’m not a troll,” Barr said. “I don’t follow white nationalists by any means. I have nothing to do with them. … I like dialogue. I like having discussions.”\nA sign near the Lenin statue describes the history of the sculpture and how it came to be in Seattle.

      "text": "August 16, 2017 at 3:38 pm August 16, 2017 at 4:25 pm GeekWire Summit: Early-bird tickets here! \nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince (LinkedIn Photo) \nTwo days after it tried to have it both ways by keeping the Daily Stormer as a client, Cloudflare has reversed course and pulled its services, which protect websites against denial-of-service attacks. \nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told The Verge that he decided to end its association with the neo-Nazi site after realizing that supports of that site’s hateful ideology were starting to consider Cloudflare an ally to their cause. After a woman protesting a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va. was killed by a white supremacist on Saturday, the Daily Stormer published a demeaning article about the victim, and that decision has sent Daily Stormer’s tech suppliers running in the days since . \nGoDaddy was the first to act, revoking the domain name registration that Daily Stormer had used to deploy its site to the internet, and Google declined to come to its rescue. Discord, Facebook, Twitter, and Squarespace have all cut ties with the Daily Stormer and other white supremacist movements and individuals using their services. \nCloudflare’s services allow companies to defend themselves against distributed denial-of-service attacks — which essentially flood a site’s servers with traffic making it inaccessible to everyone — by spreading a site’s traffic across a huge distributed network. It doesn’t host websites, but it allows victims of harassment and controversial sites alike to stay online. \nIn its first statement on the matter on Monday, Cloudflare tried to argue that pulling its services wouldn’t remove the Daily Stormer from the internet, which is an annoying exercise in semantics. Without those services, however, attacks forced the Daily Stormer to a web host based in Russia and the site eventually went offline on Wednesday afternoon. \nTech companies that have long argued they aren’t responsible for policing legal content are finding themselves on the defensive since the events of the weekend, which also injured 20 people. Prince didn’t sound very enthusiastic about the next time he has to decide whether or not to boot a paying customer in his comments to the Verge. \n“I think that we as the internet need to have a conversation about where the right place for content restriction is…but there was no way we could have that conversation until we resolved this particular issue,” Prince told The Verge. \nAnd in an incredible email to staff, obtained by Gizmodo , Prince was even blunter. \n“Having made that decision we now need to talk about why it is so dangerous. I’ll be posting something on our blog later today. Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn’t be allowed on the Internet. No one should have that power.” \nUpdate: Cloudflare reached out to share Prince’s post, which can be found here .

      "text": "W.Rebel via Wikimedia 13 frameworks for mastering machine learning \nOver the past year, machine learning has gone mainstream with a bang. The “sudden” arrival of machine learning isn’t fueled by cheap cloud environments and ever more powerful GPU hardware alone. It is also due to an explosion of open source frameworks designed to abstract away the hardest parts of machine learning and make its techniques available to a broad class of developers. \nHere is a baker’s dozen of machine learning frameworks, either freshly minted or newly revised within the past year. These tools caught our attention for their provenance, for bringing a novel simplicity to their problem domain, for addressing a specific challenge associated with machine learning, or for all of the above. \n[ See InfoWorld’s review of the best frameworks for machine learning and deep learning: TensorFlow, Spark MLlib, Scikit-learn, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, and Caffe . | Get a digest of the day’s top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] Apache Foundation Apache Spark MLlib \nApache Spark may be best known for being part of the Hadoop family, but this in-memory data processing framework was born outside of Hadoop and is making a name for itself outside the Hadoop ecosystem as well. Spark has become a go-to machine learning tool, thanks to its growing library of algorithms that can be applied to in-memory data at high speed. \nPrevious versions of Spark bolstered support for MLlib, a major platform for math and stats users, and allowed Spark ML jobs to be suspended and resumed via the persistent pipelines feature. Spark 2.0, released in 2016, improves on the Tungsten high-speed memory management system and the new DataFrames streaming API, both of which can provide performance boosts to machine learning apps. H2O.ai H2O \nH2O , now in its third major revision, provides access to machine learning algorithms by way of common development environments (Python, Java, Scala, R), big data systems (Hadoop, Spark), and data sources (HDFS, S3, SQL, NoSQL). H2O is meant to be used as an end-to-end solution for gathering data, building models, and serving predictions. For instance, models can be exported as Java code, allowing predictions to be served on many platforms and in many environments. \nH2O can work as a native Python library, or by way of a Jupyter Notebook, or by way of the R language in R Studio. The platform also includes an open source, web-based environment called Flow, exclusive to H2O, which allows interacting with the dataset during the training process, not just before or after. Apache Foundation Apache Singa \n“ Deep learning ” frameworks power heavy-duty machine-learning functions, such as natural language processing and image recognition. Singa , an Apache Incubator project, is an open source framework intended to make it easy to train deep-learning models on large volumes of data. \nSinga provides a simple programming model for training deep-learning networks across a cluster of machines, and it supports many common types of training jobs: convolutional neural networks , restricted Boltzmann machines , and recurrent neural networks . Models can be trained synchronously (one after the other) or asynchronously (side by side), on both CPU and GPU clusters, with FPGA support coming soon. Singa also simplifies cluster setup with Apache Zookeeper . Facebook Caffe2 \nDeep-learning framework Caffe is “made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.” Originally developed in 2013 for machine vision projects , Caffe has since expanded to include other applications, such as speech and multimedia. \nSpeed is a major priority, so Caffe has been written entirely in C++, with CUDA acceleration support, although it can switch between CPU and GPU processing as needed. The distribution includes a set of free and open source reference models for common classification jobs, with other models created and donated by the Caffe user community . \nA new iteration of Caffe backed by Facebook, called Caffe2 , is currently under development for a 1.0 release. Its goals are to make it easier to perform distributed training and deploy to mobile devices, to provide support for new kinds of hardware like FPGAs, and to make use of cutting-edge features like 16-bit floating-point training . Google Google TensorFlow \nMuch like Microsoft’s DMTK, Google TensorFlow is a machine learning framework designed to scale across multiple nodes. As with Google’s Kubernetes, it was built to solve problems internally at Google, and Google eventually elected to release it as an open source product. \nTensorFlow implements what are called data flow graphs, where batches of data (“tensors”) can be processed by a series of algorithms described by a graph. The movements of the data through the system are called “flows”—hence the name. Graphs can be assembled with C++ or Python and can be processed on CPUs or GPUs. \nRecent updates to TensorFlow have added better compatibility with Python, improved GPU operations, opened the door to running TensorFlow on a broader variety of hardware, and expanded the library of built-in classification and regression tools. Amazon Amazon Machine Learning \nAmazon’s approach to cloud services has followed a pattern. Provide the basics, bring in a core audience that cares, let them build on top of it, then find out what they really need and deliver that. \nThe same could be said of Amazon’s foray into offering machine learning as a service, Amazon Machine Learning . It connects to data stored in Amazon S3, Redshift, or RDS, and can run binary classification, multiclass categorization, or regression on that data to create a model. However, note that the resulting models can’t be imported or exported, and datasets for training models can’t be larger than 100GB. \nStill, Amazon Machine Learning shows how machine learning is being made a practicality instead of a luxury. And for those who want to go further, or remain less tightly coupled to the Amazon cloud, Amazon’s Deep Learning machine image includes many of the major deep learning frameworks including Caffe2, CNTK, MXNet, and TensorFlow. Microsoft Microsoft Azure ML Studio \nGiven the sheer amount of data and computational power needed to perform machine learning, the cloud is an ideal environment for ML apps. Microsoft has outfitted Azure with its own pay-as-you-go machine learning service, Azure ML Studio, with monthly, hourly, and free-tier versions. (The company’s HowOldRobot project was created with this system.) You don’t even need an account to try out the service; you can log in anonymously and use Azure ML Studio for up to eight hours. \nAzure ML Studio allows users to create and train models, then turn them into APIs that can be consumed by other services. Users of the free tier get up to 10GB of storage per account for model data, and you can connect your own Azure storage to the service for larger models. A wide range of algorithms is available, courtesy of both Microsoft and third parties. \nRecent improvements include batched management of training jobs by way of the Azure Batch service, better deployment management controls, and detailed web service usage statistics. Microsoft Microsoft Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit \nThe more computers you have to throw at any machine learning problem, the better—but developing ML applications that run well across large numbers of machines can be tricky. Microsoft’s DMTK (Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit) framework tackles the issue of distributing various kinds of machine learning jobs across a cluster of systems. \nDMTK is billed as a framework rather than a full-blown out-of-the-box-solution, so the number of algorithms included with it is small. However, you will find key machine learning libraries such as a gradient boosting framework ( LightGBM ) and support for a few deep learning frameworks like Torch and Theano. \nThe design of DMTK allows for users to make the most of clusters with limited resources. For instance, each node in the cluster has a local cache, reducing the amount of traffic with the central server node that provides parameters for the job in question. Microsoft Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit \nHot on the heels of releasing DMTK, Microsoft unveiled yet another machine learning toolkit, the Computational Network Toolkit, or CNTK for short. \nCNTK is similar to Google TensorFlow in that it lets users create neural networks by way of a directed graph . Microsoft also considers CNTK to be comparable to projects like Caffe, Theano, and Torch – except for the ability of CNTK to achieve greater speed by exploiting both multiple CPUs and multiple GPUs in parallel. Microsoft claims that running CNTK on GPU clusters on Azure allowed it to accelerate speech recognition training for Cortana by an order of magnitude. \nThe latest edition of the framework, CNTK 2.0 , turns up the heat on TensorFlow by improving accuracy, adding a Java API for the sake of Spark compatibility, and supporting code from the Keras framework (commonly used with TensorFlow). Apache Foundation Apache Mahout \nMahout was originally built to allow scalable machine learning on Hadoop, long before Spark usurped that throne. But after a long period of relatively minimal activity, Mahout has been rejuvenated with new additions, such as a new environment for math, called Samsara, that allows algorithms to be run across a distributed Spark cluster. Both CPU and GPU operations are supported. \nThe Mahout framework has long been tied to Hadoop, but many of the algorithms under its umbrella can also run as-is outside of Hadoop. These are useful for stand-alone applications that might eventually be migrated into Hadoop or for Hadoop projects that could be spun off into their own stand-alone applications. Samsung Veles \nVeles is a distributed platform for deep-learning applications, and like TensorFlow and DMTK, it’s written in C++, although it uses Python to perform automation and coordination between nodes. Datasets can be analyzed and automatically normalized before being fed to the cluster, and a REST API allows the trained model to be used in production immediately (assuming your hardware is up to the task). \nVeles goes beyond merely employing Python as glue code, as the Python-based Jupyter Notebook can be used to visualize and publish results from a Veles cluster. Samsung hopes that releasing Veles as open source will stimulate further development, such as ports to Windows and MacOS. mlpack contributors mlpack 2 \nA C++-based machine learning library originally rolled out in 2011, mlpack is designed for “scalability, speed, and ease-of-use,” according to the library’s creators. Implementing mlpack can be done through a cache of command-line executables for quick-and-dirty “black box” operations, or with a C++ API for more sophisticated work. \nVersion 2 of mlpack includes many new kinds of algorithms, along with refactorings of existing algorithms to speed them up or slim them down. For example, it ditches the Boost library’s random number generator in favor of C++11’s native random functions. \nOne longstanding disadvantage of mlpack is the lack of bindings for any language other than C++. That means users of other languages will need a third-party library, such as the one for Python . Work has been done to add MATLAB support , but projects like mlpack tend to enjoy greater uptake when they’re directly useful in the major environments where machine learning work takes place. Intel Neon \nNervana, a company that builds its own deep learning hardware and software platform (now part of Intel), has offered up a deep learning framework named Neon as an open source project. Neon uses pluggable modules to allow the heavy lifting to be done on CPUs, GPUs, or Nervana’s own silicon . \nNeon is written chiefly in Python, with a few pieces in C++ and assembly for speed. This makes the framework immediately available to others doing data science work in Python or in any other framework that has Python bindings. \nMany standard deep learning models such as LSTM, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, are available as pre-trained models for Neon. The latest release, Neon 2.0, adds Intel’s Math Kernel Library to accelerate performance on CPUs. Princeton Vision Group Marvin \nAnother relatively recent production, the Marvin neural network framework, is a product of the Princeton Vision Group. Marvin was “born to be hacked,” as its creators explain in the documentation for the project, which relies only on a few files written in C++ and the CUDA GPU framework. Despite the deliberately minimal code, the project does come with a number of pretrained models that can be reused with proper citation and contributed to with pull requests like the project’s own code.

      "text": "The Value of Attention Advertising Attribution \nOne of the challenges in developing this year’s report was whittling the list down to ten, and this could easily be a list of 15 or 20 issues depending on where you sit in the digital media ecosystem. Our goal was not to provide a laundry list of every issue out there, but to consolidate into a single document the most common issues we hear from clients and to discuss the opportunities presented through better measurement. \nIf there’s a single common thread through most of this year’s themes, it is the power of digital data to drive quality . The world today looks very different than even a few years ago because of the large datasets now underlying all of measurement. Data scale brings with it a host of new challenges and increasing complexity, but at the same time offers new ways of solving previously intractable challenges. Large datasets allow us to leverage data science methods to eliminate waste, improve methodological approaches, slice and dice data more finely, and combine disparate datasets to drive new value. \nDigital data is helping to eliminate the effects of bot traffic and non-viewable ads so only quality impressions are measured. It serves as the methodological basis for measuring unduplicated reach, which helps monetize mobile and gives digital a bigger audience footprint. This, combined with a viewability standard, brings digital ads into alignment with TV. Digital data is moving the conversation beyond age/gender demographics alone to advanced audience reporting, giving media companies new ways to value their inventory and better meet the needs of advertisers. And digital data provides the measurement granularity so we can properly attribute value to the ads that are working. \nIn a fragmented digital media ecosystem, digital data is the resource that will advance our industry and is at the heart of these ten burning issues. Some of these issues are more easily addressed than others, but our collective progress can put everyone in a better position to succeed. More about",

Those who have been through the placement grind know what it takes to ace the routine – it certainly isn’t easy. \nAmit Mehta, who was a student at Bangalore University, recalls a time when he wanted to work at a corporate way back in 2003. “I failed thrice before I learnt from experience how to answer interviewers,” says Amit, who works with a semi-conductor company now. \nBack then, the job scenario was different; now, despite the many fields and options, jobs are harder to get due to automation. Even at placement tests and interviews, hiring managers look for skills that make the candidate a perfect fit for the job description from the start . \nLooking at the situation on the ground, 5 students of IIT-Kanpur started Pariksha, a company to help prepare students for placement by aggregating knowledge from several universities. \nUtkarsh Bagri, Rahul Ranjan, Deepak Choudhary and Saket Diwakar were in their third year, in 2013, when they started up. What worked for them was the fact that the five were inherently business geeks. Utkarsh and Deepak were wing-mates and were skilled in building online campus communities. Saket and Rahul soon joined them. Their first user base was from IIT Kanpur, and they began to help students preparing for JEE. \nHowever, they decided to change track after interacting with some seniors. \nRahul Ranjan, Co-Founder of Pariksha, says, “Our seniors and batchmates were struggling to find a proper channel to prepare for placements. So we collaborated with the placement cell of IIT-Kanpur to roll out the initial version of the platform.” \nPariksha received an overwhelming response on the beta version as all senior students began to use the placement learning modules. Not surprisingly, the founders skipped going for their own placement and began to work full time on Pariksha. Co-founder of Pariksha Rahul Ranjan The quick expansion \nBy the time they finished college, the founders had expanded considerably – they were in eight IITs in 2015, 60 colleges by 2016 and currently have a presence in 270 colleges, including IITs, NITs, BITS Pilani University and JNTU-A. \nRahul Ranjan says: “As we were going online, we provided Pariksha as a SaaS to coaching institutes as they lack basic technological infrastructure. Pariksha provides a student with actionable analytics to improve on weaknesses and provides teachers with technology to monitor the progress of students at once.” \nAlongside they offer placement prep modules to final year students by signing a MoU with colleges. \nUser survey on Pariksha shows that close to 80 percent students prepare for competitive exams along with preparing for placements. \n“This number increases as you move to colleges in tier-II tier-III cities due to lack of employment opportunities,” Ranjan says. \nInsights from the module show that there is a significant gap between skill employers seek and the skill students graduate with. With AI and robotics coming in, jobs have become more skill-specific and system engineers are no longer sought after. Companies that earlier hired analyst profiles are now being more specific about what kind of skills they need in a candidate. Pariksha’s business model \nLearning from these insights, the founders launched Pariksha Prime, which helps a student to upskill for corporate opportunities and also prepares them for competitive exams. \nEvery student pays a monthly subscription fee and gets access to all the content on Pariksha. \nA student can take courses on data science, front end and back end development along with coding interviews, corporate finance or IoT. They can also prepare for competitive exams like GATE and GMAT. The courses listed on Pariksha are acquired through partnership with institutes and other content creators. \nThe Prime option has 600 students, and the company provides them with personal assistance in every aspect of their career. \nPariksha also plans to include various courses for students of core branches like electrical and mechanical with time . \nThe company believes it can grow very fast because a student is ready to pay Rs 5,000 per month to prepare for placements. The market size, estimated in this manner, stands at $1.84 billion according to the company. \nThe major challenge is gaining the trust of the user, and gauging whether they see value addition from the platform or not. \n“That’s why we have focused on basic but the most important aspects of one’s career such as resumes and projects. Pursuing courses online was also a challenge but with reducing data charges many more people are using online resources rather than offline to prepare themselves,” Ranjan says. \nHe says we are living in a time where technology is playing a major role in defining the lives of people. “In education, it is bound to redefine the way a student prepares,” Ranjan adds. \nAccording to KPMG and Google India’s report on online education it is estimated that it will hit $1.96 billion by 2021, with paid users rising sixfold from 1.6 million now to 9.6 million. \nPariksha’s business compliments other edtech companies like Jigsaw, Simplilearn and Edureka. \nGaurav Vohra, Co-Founder of Jigsaw Academy, believes that reskilling is the need of the hour and “students have to be prepared for specific skill sets.” \nEducation is clearly one of the biggest opportunities, but this edtech company born in a college believes it can help students crack the Pariksha to get their first job! shares \nLooking to exhibit at TechSparks 2017?

      "text": "S eth Stephens-Davidowitz wanted to call his new book How Big Is My Penis? , but his publishers demurred. He settled for Everybody Lies . The book is subtitled What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are and it’s a polished display of some of the early fruits of “big data” science. Its principal defect, perhaps, is that it doesn’t say enough about how many of these fruits are rotten.\nStephens-Davidowitz’s first source, when he set up as a data scientist, was Google Trends, which records the relative frequency of particular searches in different places at different times. He soon added Google Adwords, which registers the actual number of searches. Then he moved on to other vastnesses: Wikipedia, Facebook and then PornHub, one of the largest pornographic sites in the world. PornHub gave him its complete data set, duly anonymised: every single search and video view. He also “scraped” many other sites, including neo-Nazi sites such as Stormfront, which account for the internet’s resemblance to the box jellyfish, a highly poisonous predator with 60 anuses.\nIgnoble metadata flowed in. He found that searches for racist jokes rise about 30% on Martin Luther King Day in the US, and that in the recent Republican primaries, regions that supported Donald Trump in the largest numbers made the most Google searches for “nigger”. Data from Prosper, a peer-to-peer loan website, showed that there are five expressions in particular that one should beware of when reviewing applications for loans: “God”, “promise”, “will pay”, “hospital” and “thank you”. Making promises “is a sure sign that someone will … not do something”. “God” is particularly bad news.\nThere are many such facts waiting to be harvested. For a social scientist such as Stephens-Davidowitz, big data has four central virtues. First, it’s a “digital truth serum”: it supplies honest data on matters people lie about in surveys, for instance racist attitudes, but above all (to Quote: Mick Jagger ) “sex and sex and sex and sex”. Second, it offers the means to run large-scale randomised controlled experiments – which are usually extremely laborious and expensive – at almost no cost, and in this way uncover causal linkages in addition to mere correlations. Third, the sheer quantity of data allows us to zoom in precisely on small subsets of people in a way that was previously impossible. Finally, it provides new types of data.\nStephens-Davidowitz thinks searches of internet pornography habits are probably “the most important development … ever … in our ability to understand human sexuality”. They deliver data that “ Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , Freud and Foucault would have drooled over”.\nSome of his sexual facts are depressing, others are funny and touching. Some are engaging because we find them extraordinary, others because we find them all-too-human. The search data suggests that hundreds of thousands of young men are predominantly attracted to elderly women. Many heterosexual men feel about their partner what William Wordsworth felt about his wife Mary (they wish she’d put on weight). Anal sex is on course to overtake vaginal sex in pornography before the end of the decade. Pornography “in which violence is perpetrated against a woman … almost always appeals disproportionately to women”. More than 75% of searches of the form “I want to have sex with my …” are incestuous. Men search for ways to perform oral sex on themselves as often as they search for how to give a woman an orgasm.\nBig data isn’t intrinsically dangerous or evil, and it can be extraordinarily valuable and engaging\nThere are many unwavering specialisations. For some women, only short fat men with small penises will do; for some men, only massive nipples. Thirty per cent only ever watch pornography of the ugliest kind. But many of us are not as weird as our online behaviour may suggest. Distortion is introduced by the fact that certain types of Google searches “skew towards the forbidden”, and there are numerous subtleties and traps when it comes to the interpretation of data, many of which Stephens-Davidowitz expounds clearly. For all that the numbers are big, and they add up.\n“The next Foucault will be a data scientist. The next Freud will be a data scientist. The next Marx will be a data scientist.” This is unlikely, I think, but these future individuals will do well to work with data scientists, and by the end of Everybody Lies Stephens-Davidowitz has almost earned his flourishes (“What constitutes data has been wildly reimagined … Everything is data!”). What he hasn’t done is say enough about the dangers. I expected a reference to Cathy O’Neil, who shows in her book Weapons of Math Destruction (2016) how programs based on big data introduce a frightening new efficiency into predatory advertising, “distort higher education, drive up debt, spur mass incarceration, pummel the poor at nearly every juncture, and undermine democracy”. Programs designed with the very best intentions fall into deadly self-confirming feedback loops that confirm their efficacy even as they spiral away from the truth and increase injustice.\nOne of the greatest dangers of the internet, noted by Daniel Kahneman in his valuable book Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011) , arises from the fact that “people can maintain an unshakable faith in any proposition, however absurd, when they are sustained by a community of like-minded believers”. This isn’t any sort of exaggeration (witness the fact that some people deny the existence of consciousness); the trouble is that any belief – any prejudice or hatred – can now find a large supporting community on the internet.\nStephens-Davidowitz has a reply to these worries. He’s a social scientist, and malignant programs aren’t data science in his sense of the term. Their creators aren’t simply trying to describe and explain human behaviour; they’re directing it and manipulating it. Big data isn’t intrinsically dangerous or evil, and it can be extraordinarily valuable and engaging. New facts spring up everywhere. Some of the results – such as the correlation between hurricanes and the consumption of strawberry Pop-Tarts – are agreeably surreal. For him “the big point is this: social science is becoming a real science. And this new, real science is poised to improve our lives”.\nI like Stephens-Davidowitz’s suggestion in a recent interview: “Sometimes I think it would be a good thing if everyone’s porn habits were released at once. It would be embarrassing for 30 seconds … then we’d all get over it and be more open about sex.” But I don’t share his general optimism. I suspect the easy availability of pornography is turning out to be one of the great tragedies of human history, destructive of the best kind of sexual relations. If we had an infallible happyometer that could measure the overall gains and losses to human existence caused by the internet, I think we’d find that the balance was – will increasingly be – negative.\n• Everybody Lies: What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are is published by Bloomsbury.

      "text": "How to build a cognitive system August 16, 2017 | Written by: Shoel Perelman \nCategorized: eCommerce & Merchandising Share this post: \nIBM is in the process of rolling out an exciting transformation of our eCommerce portfolio. This is the third blog in a series of posts that will formally introduce these advancements and review the architecture of the services from a technical point of view. In this blog, the author outlines the future of software platforms, the case for cognitive innovation, and how it’s a prerequisite to stay relevant in the market. Click here to review the second blog posting , A New Approach to Customization for Commerce Platforms. Click here for the first blog posting , Monolith to Pebbles: Transformation of the IBM Commerce Portfolio. \n\n\n\nIt was 20 years ago. As a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed college hire wearing a shirt and tie, I formally started my professional software career with a steaming pile of spaghetti Perl 4 code dumped on my lap with the task of — Make It Work Reliably. Within five years of that point (long having thrown away that Perl code), I was the guy in the office who could spot a memory leak in a Java Virtual Machine by glancing at log files spewing in xterms from across the room. I was the guru and god of the codebase I had designed and built. It was a great feeling being the architect. \nCognition becomes expectation \nAs cognition in the software we use every day advances from a pleasant surprise to an expectation, there’s a guru shift going on from the people who make transactional systems sing to those who straddle the line between pure software and data science. \n\nFor the past 20 years, engineering a system for rock-solid stability under high loads was the chief goal. Proving this scalability has been a hallmark of commercial software vendor bake-offs. Achieving that goal has become more formulaic over the past 10 years as J2EE replaced C++ as the de-facto enterprise language. While I still have tremendous respect for a high-scale working transactional system that can withstand exposure to the hard knocks of public internet traffic, I am coming to hold a higher level of fascination for systems that are able to observe real world dirty data, form hypotheses, test them by optimizing real world problems, and learn from their mistakes. \nHow to engineer cognitive \nFor all the talk of cognitive systems, what goes into engineering such a system? As the Engineering VP for IBM Watson Commerce, I’ve had the fortune of learning about this journey from building transactional systems that execute rules, such as an order management system that determines which warehouse to ship your jeans from, to systems that appear to reason and learn from cause and effect. \n\nFor example, the whole concept of conducting an end-to-end test has changed. It used to be about proving that the system behaved as expected for a certain amount of time with no memory leaks, crashes or errors. Now, it is a practice more akin to how pharmaceutical companies test new drugs, running thousands of trials under simulated conditions that are as close to the real world as possible. But how do you simulate the emotional reaction of a human? How do you simulate what UPS and FedEx will do during a snowstorm? The process becomes much more creative, like playing Sim City. When an outcome is unexpected, there’s no error to examine and fix. All you can do is hypothesize based upon the evidence and construct experiments to validate these hypotheses. \nThe new software gurus \nWho are the new gurus who give birth to these types of systems? These are the rare people who can bridge the gap between discrete data processing code and code that finds needles in haystacks. They aren’t merely data scientists who studied statistics. They aren’t purely software engineers who studied computer science. They live with a foot in both worlds – as boundary spanners. They may not be considered ‘real math’ people by pure mathematicians as they may not have math Ph.D.’s and may not be the ones who come to mind as the architect guru’s by business users. These are the people who write code that makes you wonder “how does it know that?” when you scroll through “People You May Know” in your favorite social app. These are the people who make software go beyond automating drudgery to engaging with you with pleasant surprises. \n\nWhere do you find and hire these people who can infuse intelligence into commercially engineered software? In my experience, most originally started out as software developers who became grumpy working on “normal” development because they have untapped additional powers, being able to understand formulas with Greek letters while still having an acute appreciation for why variable names shouldn’t be one or two letters. If your company is diverse enough to have a formal data science team or a team of math experts working in a quantitative marketing department, you likely have people who approach the crossover from the other side, as formally trained mathematicians who learned software engineering to make their own code more maintainable. \n\nAs building robust transactional systems becomes easier with access to so much solid open source software and the complexity shifting towards cognition, what does this mean for the relevancy of commercial software vendors? Why not just use mature open source for your transactional systems and spend your effort learning how to build cognition on top? I believe that in order to stay relevant in the market, the key value that vendors must offer is to do the hard work of baking cognition into the ‘out of the box’ SaaS experience. While Open Source software leaves the window open for cognitive innovation, where software vendors, SaaS in particular, can shine is baking ongoing improvement to data science models into the day to day operation of the system. As a user of these systems, you should expect no less. \n\nIf the software vendor challenge of the past 10 years has been to provide rock solid, yet flexible, transactional software, the challenge for the next 10 years is who can deliver a transactional system that wakes up already knowing how to think about the data flowing through its veins – and unobtrusively makes its practitioners appear brilliant to their peers (and stakeholders). That is the challenge that vendors must excel at to prove to clients our worth relative to the many robust open source choices available. This is the challenge we hold ourselves to at IBM to be worthy of the ‘Watson’ name. \n",

      "text": "08/24/17 AT 12:57 PM Close \nHenri Waelbroeck, director of research at machine learning trade execution system Portware, says rather poetically that the system \"reads the tea leaves\" in market data to distinguish different sorts of orders and execute trades more efficiently. \nPortware uses artificial intelligence to help traders select the best algorithm for particular market conditions, asset class, broker, venue etc., interacting with the order flow and computing a mind-boggling array of variables in real time. \nNewsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York. Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup \nSay you are buying a stock, and you predict there is likely to be more orders hitting the bid side of the spread in the next five minutes, you should be able to operate an efficient algorithm that only posts limit orders and collects the spread as it executes. Using an algorithm that crosses the spread in this instance would be wasteful since you expect order flow to be coming your way. \nWaelbroeck, formerly a professor at the Institute of Nuclear Sciences at the National University of Mexico, whose specialisms include genetic algorithms and chaos theory, said: \"Just throwing machine learning at problems usually doesn't give a very good answer. You need to have a good analytical understanding of what's going on and this usually gives you a baseline model and then you find opportunities to insert machine learning tactically to exploit opportunities to improve the models.\" \nThe Portware Brain, which is currently in beta, embraces an entire spectrum of complexity from high volume, low latency trading to longer horizon investing and trade scheduling. One of things it does is look at a portfolio manager's trading history: some will be trading with the trend, in which case they are going to be competing with other managers for the same trades; others might be contrarian. \"Of course it's never as simple as that,\" says Waelbroeck, \"it depends on the circumstances; they can be contrarians one moment and trend followers the next\". Deep learning \nThe system observes what is driving order flow, looking for things like imbalances in the market. Where portfolio managers are competing with others you are going to find adverse order flow on the market and that may be detectable. Different sorts of orders are categorised as being high or low urgency, which enables the execution of trades more efficiently. \n\"We look at all sorts of other sources too. You can have a system that works well most of the time and fails spectacularly sometimes, and produces no net value. \n\"It's important to understand when circumstances are unique, and not reflective of the statistical average. We look at data streams like news options to identify situations that warrant either a different model, or perhaps walking away and not going to a default strategy with no specific prediction at all. \n\"So machine learning is used in both capturing the statistical average for normal situations and also at identifying outliers to know when not to use the routine model, so to speak,\" said Waelbroeck. \nThe Portware Brain is based on the concept of interacting agents. This framework enables the deployment of deep learning techniques, essentially processing data through an architecture of agents; each processes the information at their disposal and produces an output which is then consumed by the next agent and so on. \n\"You can have several agents briefing things and using the other agents' outputs as inputs. You can have potentially deep stacks of systems like this, similar to deep learning. \n\"The agents we deploy are essentially the basic machine learning techniques like regressions, Bayesian learning trees, something we call 'consensus agents', sort of a home invention. Combining these in different ways enables you to create potentially interesting model architectures,\" he said. Concept drift \nThere have been a lot of advancements in deep learning in areas like image processing. But predicting the movement of asset prices using AI presents its own set of challenges. Traditional approaches to finance made wide use of normal distributions in stock market analysis to maximise return rates. \nToday's methods use artificial neural networks which continuously monitor themselves, allowing for a non-stationary model of market behaviour. These applications have vast amounts of data arriving continuously and the target concept about which data is being collected may change over time, known as concept drift. \nWaelbroeck said: \"A lot of the things we are tracking are evolving systems and the market reacts to itself. You find a useful predictive driver for PMs short term alpha - well that may not be there next year. \n\"So anytime we do a study for a PM we always look at concept drift. We have developed techniques to identify drivers that are robust, but also we look at system stability and plasticity to identify the optimal trading training windows and retraining frequencies.\" \nRegulation \nAnother interesting question is where AI-optimised execution meets the regulatory notion of best execution. These questions come up specifically with MiFIDII in Europe. It's not entirely clear if that is actually going to promote or hinder the development of new best execution capabilities. \nWaelbroeck says that to some extent regulation is a double-edged sword: \"On the one hand it focuses trading desks' attentions on best execution and encourages them to adopt advanced technologies to promote best execution; on the other hand regulation has a sort of contrarian effect of forcing people to stick to established processes. \n\"This is because any deviation from the sort of established state of the art needs to be explained and documented in regulatory filings. \n\"Those explanations can be complicated and expose the firm to regulatory scrutiny. So, creative efforts to create best execution sometimes run into the challenge of requiring changes in compliance processes.\" Join the Discussion ",

      "text": "08/25/17 AT 2:23 PM Close \nFinancial technology provider FlexTrade has launched a best execution platform to ensure the best possible results for clients when orders are executed, planned, monitored and proven during the full trading life cycle. \nAndy Mahoney, head of sales at FlexTrade UK, said: \"Our FlexTRADER EMS is built for best execution. With MiFID II approaching, we have tied together our 3rd party integration program, expanded into fixed income, and added enhancements to our TCA application, FlexTCA , to provide our view on best execution across the asset classes.\" \nNewsweek is hosting an AI and Data Science in Capital Markets conference on December 6-7 in New York. Photo: NewsweekMediaGroup \nThe platform provides clients with a customised workflow to help them to achieve best execution, said a statement. This workflow provides traders with data from both transactional and market sources along with market intelligence from integrated third parties, all whilst capturing the complete trade in real-time to later provide data for analysis. \nIn addition, the site provides relevant news and content regarding MiFID II legislation, including FlexTrade's customised MiFID II compliance solution, answers to commonly asked questions regarding inducements and informative blog post updates. \nWith only four months to go until the MiFID II's 3 January 2018 implementation date, buy-side firms are facing huge changes in disclosure and transparency requirements, which could upend their data management architectures. It's fair to say this is something firms are wrestling with. \nBy raising the bar on market transparency, MiFID II has created a huge data management problem for buy-side and sell-side firms, particularly for investment managers. They need to take in a lot of data from the various venues to provide disclosures to their clients and to their national competent regulators. Transaction reporting is necessary for all financial instruments on a T+1 basis, but while MiFID I had 20 fields, MiFID II raises the number to 65. Join the Discussion",

      "text": "17 August 2017 shares \nThis digital lending platform, started by four ISB-alums including the ex-CFO of Housing.com, disburses loans to SMEs within 48 hours, and claims to have processed over 12,000 applications so far across 90 tier-1 to tier-3 cities. \nForty-one-year-old Neelam Kuk’s enterprising spirit was getting too grand for the small alleyways of Agra. Determined to scale her business, she set up her store on online marketplace Shopclues by opening a seller account and listing her products on it. But just when she looked to add new products on her store, a lack of funds brought her dream run to a screeching halt. \nFlexiloans came to her rescue. After vetting her case thoroughly and seeing that she had been amply supported by her husband till then, the financial services startup approved the Rs 1 lakh loan she sought. The funds were funneled to her within two days, in Agra, where even large NBFCs are yet to consolidate their presence, and all at the click of a button. From left: Manish Lunia, Abhishek Kothari, Ritesh Jain, Deepak Jain, the co-founders of Flexiloans.com. \nFounded in November 2015 by Abhishek Kothari, Deepak Jain, Munish Lunia and Ritesh Jain, Flexiloans is a digital lending platform that provides quick, fast and transparent funding access to millions of deserving small businesses. They formally launched operations in April 2016 with Uber and Shopclues as partners to reach out to their target customers. \nStarting out with working capital loans and line of credit, their system needs the customer to go to their website, fill out an application form, and submit the necessary documents online, following which, a credit analysis is performed on the customer profile through their in-house scoring model. Once approved, the customer is offered a loan which is disbursed as soon as they accept the terms and conditions. “Our TATs is below 48 hours in most cases,” says Deepak. \nConvincing customers to send their documents digitally was a challenge, so subsequently, they made tweaks like incorporating the Aadhaar QR code scanning mechanism which scrapped and auto-filled the demographic information. \n“We are currently lending through our partners and associate NBFCs. The revenue we earn is primarily from the financing and processing fees. At the right time, we will use our partner network to grow our bouquet as a marketplace as well,” says Deepak, co-founder of Flexiloans. \nThe firm uses multiple sources of data to score an applicant, most of which are non-traditional credit scoring parameters. This proprietary credit engine and ability to dispense the loan decisions within 48 hours is what distinguishes FlexiLoans from traditional credit lending organisations. \nBy July 2016, they had already processed over 500 applications. In September last year, marquee names in banking like Sanjay Nayar, CEO, KKR India, Anil Jaggia, Ex-CIO, HDFC Bank, VikramSud, Ex- COO, Citi Asia-Pac pumped Rs 100 crore into the company to fuel their next phase of growth. This was one of largest first rounds raised by a startup in India. In fact, they had been targeting bankers for this round specifically so that they would double up as advisors The dream team & how they started up \nFlexiloans’ founders are an illustrious lot. Abhishek, 36, is an IIT-Bombay and ISB-alum with 12 years of experience in building data and analytics-led strategies for financial institutions. Deepak, 35, is a certified CA who also went to ISB, holds 11 years of experience across investment banking and management consulting with Axis Capital (Enam) and JSW, and has worked on multiple top banking deals like Axis Bank QIP, RBL IPO, Capital First QIP, HDFC NCD and warrants, Mannapuram QIP, etc. \nThe third and fourth partners, Manish and Ritesh, also hold the same credentials as Deepak, and while the former comes with 12 years of experience in M&A, NBFC, wealth management, telecom, the latter worked with various startups in the finance and technology domains – and also served as the CFO at Housing.com . \nWhile most of them came from business families with an inherent entrepreneurial temper, taking the plunge was still a decision riddled with apprehensions as they all held senior positions and had glowing prospects in the corporate sphere. \n“However, the opportunity we saw in creating something very big in SME lending made our decisions easier,” says Deepak. \nFlexiloans.com was conceptialised when a few of them met a friend who was seeing good traction in her business and wanted a business loan to expand her supplier base beyond her father’s store. \n“Banks either required documents like three years’ ITR returns and a good credit score (she didn’t have a score yet) or collateral-like property and guarantee from family, etc. All of these options were either not available or did not fit well with the mindset of a young entrepreneur of today’s India. Another challenge was the low ticket size of the loan which wasn’t big enough for most banks to get excited about,” Deepak explains. \nUpon further brainstorming, they came to the conclusion that this loan could have been granted simply based on her financial track record over the past 12 months. Further overlaying her demographic data – in terms of her educational qualifications and social network — would make the transaction airtight. \nSensing they might be on to something, they went out and met more than a hundred small entrepreneurs to see if timely access to finance through formal channels was a big concern, and all of their experiences validated their hypothesis. \n“The SME segment is credit-starved and hence, to get adequate funds, they turn to informal sources of credit,” says Deepak. Rapid expansion \nBy February 2017, they had partnered with all major e-commerce players in India like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Shopclues, Jabong, Voonik, etc, and went live with a brand new offering: loans against POS transactions, which caused a major spike in volumes. In the same month, they also acquired Creditperiod.com which helped them launch the supply chain finance vertical. \nIn April 2017, they started receiving more than 2,500 applications in a month, taking their tally to more than 8,000 processed applications. By now, they have processed over 12,000 applications, with an average ticket size of Rs 5 lakh, across more than 90 cities — a number they intend to turn to 500 soon, while reducing the processing to less than 24 hours. \nThey decided to acquire customers using the B2B2B approach where they partnered with platforms or corporates that were associated with over a thousand of their target customers. \n“We partnered with major e-commerce players to reach out to vendors selling online on these platforms. Similarly we partnered with POS providers to reach out to offline Retailers associated with these platforms,” reveals Deepak. Recently, though, they also tapped into digital marketing channels to acquire customers. In conquest mode \nAs per the latest reports by the SMB Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, India currently has over 50 million SMEs that contribute to 45 percent of the nation’s GDP. Of these, more than 85 percent are underserved as per Flexiloans’ research and more than half will have some sort of a digital footprint by 2020 – which is the potential serviceable market for them and their competitors. \nA lot of alternative lending firms have entered the space lately, like Capital Float, Neogrowth, Lendingkart, etc. But their market-leading volumes in the e-commerce and POS segments, their underwriting model backed by more than 2,000 variables customised for the SME segment, and lastly, completely digital acquisition which brings down the loan processing cost such that even a Rs 10,000 loan is economically viable, are what sets Flexloans apart, in Deepak’s opinion. \nIn the next few years, they want to be a data science and machine-learning-enabled lending company with a deeper penetration in tier-1 and tier-2 cities. shares \nLooking to exhibit at TechSparks 2017?

      "text": "Zooming in on climate predictions August 17, 2017 by Allie Nicodemo Northeastern researchers created a framework for downscaling—or zooming in—on historic climate data sets. This allows scientists to make more detailed, localized climate projections, down to the scale of local infrastructure. Credit: Northeastern University \nIn the quest to better understand climate change, there is plenty we still don't know. But the question isn't whether or not climate change is happening. \"What we sometimes hear on the news is political manufactured uncertainty,\" said Auroop Ganguly, a professor of civil & environmental engineering at Northeastern. \nInstead, real climate change uncertainty stems from the challenge of simulating the future. What will happen to Boston's electric grid under long-term extreme weather conditions? How would a power plant in Phoenix be affected by diminishing regional resources? When should Atlanta invest in updating its water infrastructure? \nCurrent models are good at projecting regional trends. But to adequately prepare for the future effects of climate change , scientists need to zoom in on vulnerable locations such as coastal cities, threatened ecosystems, and other specific sites. \nIn a paper presented this week at the Association for Computing Machinery's conference for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, researchers outlined a new strategy for doing just that. \nThomas Vandal is a doctoral student in civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern and lead author of the paper, which was awarded Runner-Up for Best Paper in the Applied Data Science track. Vandal worked with Evan Kodra, the CEO of Northeastern spinout risQ, and NASA Ames collaborators Sangram Ganguly, Andrew Michaelis, and Ramakrishna Nemani, and his advisor Auroop Ganguly, to develop a system that zooms in on climate data to produce higher resolution projections. \nTeaching artificial brains to learn \nSimulating climate is an exercise in time travel. In order to predict the future, researchers first have to take stock of the past—in other words, they hindcast before they can forecast. \nVandal visited the NASA Ames Research Center where he collected and analyzed historic climate data sets that measure variables like temperature, rainfall, and geographic elevation, as well as NASA's extensive satellite data. To wrangle this colossal amount of data, Vandal leveraged a machine at NASA Ames called Pleiades, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers. \nThe team's goal was to create a framework for downscaling—or zooming in—on historic climate data sets. This would allow scientists to make more detailed, localized climate projections . \nThe researchers made use of cutting-edge deep learning technologies. Deep learning is an innovation of artificial neural networks—a computing system based loosely on biological nervous systems. Deep learning allows artificial neural networks to recognize patterns and perform tasks. \nVandal, who joined Northeastern after working for multiple startups in the Boston area, has used a related technology called machine learning in industry for facial expression analysis and emotion recognition. But after meeting Auroop Ganguly, he realized the technology could take a more virtuous path by making a difference in climate science, an area he cares deeply about. \n\"Rather than using machine learning to get people to click ads or maximize page views, I decided solving problems in climate science was a better use of my skills and time,\" Vandal said. \nThe result of the team's research is a framework called DeepSD, which stands for deep learning -based statistical downscaling. The system helps bring disparate climate data sets with varying degrees of detail into focus. \n\"These downscaled datasets will be of immense value to climate researchers and eco-climatic modelers who want to study anything from the impact of ecosystems to changes in climate for future warming scenarios,\" said Sangram Ganguly, one of the study's co-authors and a senior research scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute at the NASA Ames Research Center. \nAnd this is just the beginning. Vandal believes the DeepSD concept could be used to solve a variety of climate problems, from tracking extreme weather to predicting disaster events with greater confidence. In the world of computer science, the technology is still in its infancy. \n\"The computer science field changes really fast,\" Auroop Ganguly said. \"One year is like a geological age in some other fields.\"",

      "text": "Data Show Podcast How Ray makes continuous learning accessible and easy to scale The O’Reilly Data Show Podcast: Robert Nishihara and Philipp Moritz on a new framework for reinforcement learning and AI applications. \nSubscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data, data science, and AI. Find us on Stitcher , TuneIn , iTunes , SoundCloud , RSS . \nIn this episode of the Data Show , I spoke with Robert Nishihara and Philipp Moritz , graduate students at UC Berkeley and members of RISE Lab . I wanted to get an update on Ray , an open source distributed execution framework that makes it easy for machine learning engineers and data scientists to scale reinforcement learning and other related continuous learning algorithms. Many AI applications involve an agent (for example a robot or a self-driving car) interacting with an environment. In such a scenario, an agent will need to continuously learn the right course of action to take for a specific state of the environment. \nWhat do you need in order to build large-scale continuous learning applications? You need a framework with low-latency response times, one that is able to run massive numbers of simulations quickly (agents need to be able explore states within an environment), and supports heterogeneous computation graphs. Ray is a new execution framework written in C++ that contains these key ingredients. In addition, Ray is accessible via Python (and Jupyter Notebooks), and comes with many of the standard reinforcement learning and related continuous learning algorithms that users can easily call. \nAs Nishihara and Moritz point out, frameworks like Ray are also useful for common applications such as dialog systems, text mining, and machine translation. Here are some highlights from our conversation: Tools for reinforcement learning \nRay is something we've been building that's motivated by our own research in machine learning and reinforcement learning. If you look at what researchers who are interested in reinforcement learning are doing, they're largely ignoring the existing systems out there and building their own custom frameworks or custom systems for every new application that they work on. \n... For reinforcement learning, you need to be able to share data very efficiently, without copying it between multiple processes on the same machine, you need to be able to avoid expensive serialization and deserialization , and you need to be able to create a task and get the result back in milliseconds instead of hundreds of milliseconds. So, there are a lot of little details that come up. \n... In fact, people often use MPI along with lower-level multi-processing libraries to build the communication infrastructure for their reinforcement learning applications. Scaling machine learning in dynamic environments \nI think right now when we think of machine learning, we often think of supervised learning . But a lot of machine learning applications are changing from making just one prediction to making sequences of decisions and taking sequences of actions in dynamic environments. \nThe thing that's special about reinforcement learning is it's not just the different algorithms that are being used, but rather the different problem domain that it's being applied to: interactive, dynamic, real-time settings bring up a lot of new challenges. \n... The set of algorithms actually goes even a little bit further. Some of these techniques are even useful in, for example, things like text summarization and translation. You can use these techniques that have been developed in the context of reinforcement learning to better tackle some of these more classical problems [where you have some objective function that may not be easily differentiable ]. \n... Some of the classic applications that we have in mind when we think about reinforcement learning are things like dialogue systems, where the agent is one participant in the conversation. Or robotic control, where the agent is the robot itself and it's trying to learn how to control its motion. \n... For example, we implemented the evolution algorithm described in a recent OpenAI paper in Ray. It was very easy to port to Ray, and writing it only took a couple of hours. Then we had a distributed implementation that scaled very well and we ran it on up to 15 nodes. \nRelated resources:",

Subscribe to our weekly newsletter » SHARELINES New working group will chart path for big data and data science initiatives @VanderbiltU Provost Susan R. Wente (Vanderbilt University) \nAnalyzing the directions for new university big data and data science initiatives is the charge of a new working group appointed by Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost Susan R. Wente . The Data Science Visions Working Group consists of 20 faculty members from a broad set of disciplines who will be engaged in this project over the next year and will report out to the provost and all the school and college deans, including Jeff Balser , president and CEO for Vanderbilt University Medical Center and dean of the School of Medicine. \nVanderbilt’s scientific and scholarly efforts in big data and data science are diverse, ranging from transportation systems and structural biology to “smart” applications and educational neuroscience, just to name a few. \n“Big data and data science form a natural hub for collaboration across disciplines and among our schools and colleges. Our compact campus and One Vanderbilt culture allow discoveries and advances in data science to flourish,” Wente said. “To ensure that we are positioned for continued success, this working group will develop a vision for the university that will chart the path ahead in this exciting new field.” Andreas Berlind (Vanderbilt University) \nThe committee will be co-chaired by Andreas Berlind, associate professor of physics and astronomy and director of graduate studies for astrophysics, and Yu Shyr, the Harold L. Moses Professor of Cancer Research, professor and incoming chair of biostatistics, professor of biomedical informatics, professor of cancer biology, professor of health policy and director of the Center for Quantitative Sciences. \n“Andreas and Yu are the right people to lead this effort for the university as they are also spearheading a Trans-Institutional Program award this year that will bring together faculty and students from across campus to further explore big data and data science,” Wente said. “I appreciate their enthusiasm and willingness to engage the Vanderbilt community, and I look forward to working with them and the committee.” Yu Shyr (Vanderbilt University) \nWente has charged the group with conducting an analysis and collecting feedback to identify thematic research areas and educational programs to advance as well as highlight opportunities for cross-campus coordination. The committee will begin meeting at the start of the fall semester and is expected to deliver a draft report to the provost in the spring. An executive summary is to be released for feedback thereafter, with a final report and action plan targeted for August 2018. \nThe committee members are: Hiba Baroud, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of graduate recruiting for civil engineering Gregory Barz, professor and chair of musicology and ethnomusicology and associate professor of religion Andreas Berlind (co-chair), associate professor of physics and astronomy and director of graduate studies for astrophysics Marisa Cannata, research assistant professor of leadership, policy and organizations Jason Grissom, associate professor of public policy and education Emily Hodges, assistant professor of biochemistry J.

      "text": "Ding! You have gained a level. You are now a level 12 Web Developer. You have unlocked a new JavaScript framework.\nThere are many career paths you can choose as a software developer.\nAnd—just like a video game—there are paths within paths.\nWhere you ultimately end up in your career will be determined by the particular paths you choose.\nChoose the wrong path and you’ll end up a Kobold writing COBOL for the rest of your life.\nChoose the right path and you just might become a white wizard or architect, living in your ivory tower and bestowing edicts from on high.\nOk, maybe it’s not quite like that.\nBut your career path choices do make a difference ; they really do matter.\nToo many beginner programmers never take the time to consider what their actual career paths are and to deliberately choose which path and which guild they want to join.\nInstead, they just stand on the side roads shouting, “looking for a group,” and join any band of adventurers to come their way who will have them.\nThis post is all about making a conscious choice about which career path you want to pursue as a software developer, and that begins with enumerating your options.\nThe Three Types Of Software Developers\nI classify software developers, at the highest level, into three broad categories.\nYou are probably not used to thinking about software developers and in terms of these three categories because you might only really consider the largest of the three, where most software developers fall.\nBut, if we want to look at an exhaustive list of the career paths, we’ve got to start here.\nWith that said, here are the three broad categories of software developers:\nCareer Developers (most common) Freelancers (hired guns) Entreprogrammers (programmer/entrepreneur hybrids) Let’s talk about each briefly.\nFirst, we have the career developers.\nIn fact, most of my posts are focused on career developers. And it’s who we are going to be mostly focusing on in this post.\nThe reason is simple: most programmers either are, or at some point in their career were or will be, career developers.\nA career developer, according to my definition, is a software developer who has a regular job working for someone else and getting a regular paycheck.\nMost career developers want to work for a company they like, get promoted within that company, perhaps switch companies from time to time, make a good salary, and then perhaps retire some day.\nNothing wrong with this path. Like I said, it’s the default.\nNext up, we have the freelancer.\nWe talked about what a freelancer is in the last chapter, so I won’t rehash it too much here.\nEssentially, a freelancer is a software developer who works on their own, not owing allegiance to any particular company, instead choosing to operate as a hired gun and doing work for whatever client they choose to work for.\nWe won’t cover that career path in this chapter, since we already talked about it earlier, and the freelancing career path really deserves its own book.\nFinally, we’ve got the kind of software developer who is most near and dear to my heart, since I am one of them, the entreprogrammer, or the software developer entrepreneur, developerneur if you will.\nThis career path is different than being a freelancer because instead of using your skills to do work for someone else, you use them to create your own product or offering and sell that product or offering directly to clients.\nThis could be writing your own application that you sell, creating training videos or tutorials, blogging, writing, heck, even making music about your craft, and somehow making enough money from all that to put some macaroni and cheese on the dinner table each night.\nWe’re not going to talk about that career path in this chapter, since, again, we really need a whole book to discuss how to be an entreprogrammer and we touched on the basics in another post.\nCareer Developer Options What follows next is what I think are the broad specializations you can pick as a software developer.\nNote: This is not the same thing as the specializations I talked about in the post, Generalist vs. Specialist . The specializations in this post are far too broad.\nThink of these specializations, which we will call options in order to limit confusion, as very high-level career paths you can choose to go down, in a technical sense, as a software developer.\nTo be clear, these options are not exclusive to career developers. Any kind of developer is going to have to choose one of these career paths.\nYou can pick multiple paths—you can “dual class”—but you should at least pick one.\nWeb Development This is probably the largest class of software developers today.\nMost software developers are web developers, or at least do some web development work.\nAs a web developer, you… well, make web applications. Surprise!\nAs a web developer, you can work on the front-end and make things pretty, you can work on the back-end and make things work, or you can work on both and be an amazing, magical sort of web development unicorn—especially if you have some web design chops as well.\nTypically web developers who can do it all, perhaps with the exception of web design, are called “full stack developers” since they develop on the full stack of web development technologies: front-end, middleware, backend (User interface, business logic, database).\nMobile Apps man, apps are where it’s at!\nThere is an app for that, you know.\nToday, more and more software developers are choosing to become mobile developers, developing mobile applications for phones, tablets, even app-enabled TVs or wearable devices.\nApp development provides some exciting opportunities as a software developer because more and more apps are coming out each year.\nJust about every company needs a mobile app nowadays—and maybe even more than one.\nDesktop Software developers often write me to ask if desktop still exists.\nI find this fantastical because most of the time they typed that email from a computer running a desktop program—granted, it’s usually a web browser, but it’s still a DESKTOP program.\nIn fact, how do you write your code and compile it?\nMost of us use desktop based IDEs, although cloud IDEs are getting more and more popular.\nOk, fine! I’ll admit it, it’s not looking good for desktop developers.\nAre you happy? I said it.\nBut, in reality, I think there will always be at least some need for software developers who write applications that run directly on the PC.\nI could be wrong, but at least for now, this is a viable career choice, just not a highly popular one.\nVideo Games Yes, I know you want to be a video game developer.\nYes, I do, too.\nThat’s why I got into .\nBut instead of actually becoming a video game developer, I started programming printers, wrote a bunch of web applications, made some mobile apps, did a bunch of other things, and ended up writing books that drip with sarcasm and making a bunch of YouTube videos about how to pick up girls as a software developer.\nLife is not always what you expect.\nBut, in all seriousness, this is a viable career option. It’s just a difficult one with lots of competition, long hours working on video games, and well, I guess that’s all the downsides I can think of.\nDamn, I should have gone down this route.\nGo down this path—do it!\nEmbedded Systems Ok, this doesn’t sound very lucrative or cool, but trust me, it is.\nI was once an embedded systems developer making… printers!\nYES! Printers!\nSay it with me.\nSay it with excitement!\nEMBEDDED SYSTEMS ROCK!\nYou rock, baby!\nOk, it’s not glamorous, but guess what, the refrigerator that just made that ice in the glass you are drinking out of… it’s got brains in it.\nEverything has brains in it nowadays.\nAnd someone’s got to write those brains.\nAnd that someone could be YOU.\nEmbedded systems developers work on mostly real-time operating systems , which run inside of electronics, hence the name embedded systems—clever, I know.\nIt’s a good career choice because it’s in high demand and it requires specialized skill sets, which are highly valuable.\nSome of the most difficult work I’ve ever done as a software developer has involved troubleshooting really hairy timing issues on embedded systems’ programs.\nData Science\nThis one is a fairly new career path but is appearing to be one of the most lucrative ones.\nWhat exactly does a data scientist do?\nNo one really knows… I think it has something to do with “big data.”\nIn all seriousness though, data science is a huge and fast-growing area that software developers can go into, especially if they want to make the big bucks.\nA data scientist utilizes skills and technologies from several different fields to take large amounts of data, make sense of it, and draw conclusions and predictions.\nData scientists often utilize their programming skills to write custom programs to extract, manipulate, and reorganize data in order to represent it in a digestible way.\nWith the ever-growing amount of data, data science definitely holds some interesting possibilities.\nTools and Enterprise Many software developers don’t actually create software that is commercially published and sold or used inside a product that is commercially sold. Instead, they create tools to be used within an organization or internal applications.\nI actually find tools development to be extremely interesting and rewarding because when you build an effective tool that helps your team or another team do their job better, the effect can be very noticeable.\nEnterprise development can be very challenging and requires a unique set of abilities and knowledge since enterprise developers often have to have a deep understanding of the organization and the political factions which shape how software is crafted.\nCloud Cloud development is also a fairly new field, but also rapidly growing as more and more applications move to the cloud and a distributed model.\nMost cloud applications are also web applications, but they don’t necessarily have to be.\nCloud developers need to understand how the cloud works, especially in regards to scalability and availability.\nWith cloud IDEs, you can even be a cloud developer developing in the cloud.\nAutomation It’s a pretty amazing feeling when you watch an automated test you wrote run and automatically fill out fields in an application, click buttons, navigate around the app, and verify the results.\nTest automation is fun.\nI love it.\nNot only is it fun, but it’s rapidly expanding and in very high demand.\nThere is a serious lack of talented software developers who understand the proper way to create automation frameworks and write automated tests to test other software.\nA software developer who focuses on test automation builds tools for automating the testing of applications and writes automated tests to execute and verify functionality.\nTest automation can be extremely challenging and complex because it essentially requires you to write an application to test another application.\nBut, like I said, I think it’s pretty fun.\nAdvancing Beyond the Glass Ceiling In general, you’ll find that even though you’ve picked a specific class of software developer to become—or perhaps more than one—you’ll eventually hit what is known as the “glass ceiling.”\nThis glass ceiling is the practical limit on how far you can advance or how much you can get paid as a software developer.\nIt doesn’t matter how good you are, there is a point where you reach the top and you can’t really advance any further.\nBut, there are ways around—or through—this glass ceiling.\nFirst, you can choose to stop working for someone else.\nAs a freelancer, your glass ceiling is much higher, although there is still a practical limit on how much you can make as a freelancer since you still have to trade hours for dollars.\nAs an entrepreneur, it’s completely uncapped, but you could also make zero dollars or negative dollars.\nEither of those choices are viable paths that can take you through that glass ceiling.\nIf you want to stay a career developer, you can invest heavily in your personal brand and marketing yourself, and you may be able to find a company which will pay you significantly more than average just because of your reputation.\nBut, there is another way…\nYou can look for a large corporation to join and go down either a management or technical track.\nManagement or Technical? Most smaller or medium-sized companies have a practical limit on upward mobility.\nAs a software developer, you just can’t get any higher than the highest level they have, which might not be that high at all.\nBut at large corporations like Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Google, Facebook, HP, and others, the ceilings can be much higher.\nThese kinds of companies often want the very best technical people available, so they create special technical tracks to incorporate them.\nUsually, these kinds of large companies either have a technical or a management track for advancement.\nYou’ll have to choose if you want to go down the management road and leave behind your coding skills, or the technical track and keep on coding until they tell you you just can’t code no more.\nIf you choose the management track, you might advance your career by becoming a developer manager, and then perhaps a section manager or project manager, and then work your way all the way up into executive level positions like a director of development, or even the chief technology officer (CTO).\nIf you choose the technical track, you might go from senior developer to architect and then to a fellow or senior fellow.\nEach organization is going to have its own specialized tracks for technical and non-technical advancement, so the titles and positions are going to vary greatly.\nBut if you reach that glass ceiling and you want to keep on advancing, you’ll have to make a choice to either pursue the technical or management track.\nIn fact, if you are not at a large corporation that offers an advanced technical track, you might not even have a choice.\nGoing into management may be your only choice for advancement—well, either that or going out on your own.\nAlways Be Thinking About Where You Are Heading Really, the point of this post is to get you to give some serious thought to where you are heading and to deliberately steer your career.\nIf you want to advance in your career, you need to know in what direction you are going.\nSo think carefully first about what kind of software developer you want to be.\nDo you want to be a career developer forever?\nIf so, what kind?\nA web developer? Mobile? Cloud?\nAnd, to what end?\nDo you want to eventually become an architect?\nDo you just want to code and do cool stuff and not worry about advancing past a certain point?\nDo you want to rise as high as you can?\nIf so, you’d better start looking for companies that have high-level technical tracks.\nPerhaps you want to get into management eventually, or maybe you to become a CTO or even CEO.\nOr maybe you want to be a career developer earlier on in your career, and then transition to becoming a freelancer or even an entrepreneur.\nWhatever you decide to do, it’s important you make a decision and have a plan.\nYou can always change the plan later—you don’t have to commit forever to a path once you pick it—but, you should always have at least some plan, otherwise, you’ll be aimlessly drifting in your career.",

      "text": "One Art Lover’s Crusade To Catalog The World Or, how to make big data in your living room. Jason Bailey at home, with the tools he uses to archive art catalogs. ALL PHOTOGRAPHS BY TONY LUONG \nIf you’re a famous dead artist, nothing welcomes you to the canon quite like someone sitting down and meticulously recording every piece of art you ever made. These records become a compendium, often several volumes long, called a catalogue raisonné . 1 Such a catalog can itself represent the life’s work of the scholar who compiles it. It took Jacob-Baart de la Faille 11 years to complete van Gogh’s catalog . Monet’s catalog was published over a span of 18 years by a French billionaire. And it took 46 years for all of Picasso’s catalog to be released, while its publisher sold his car and apartment to finance the project. \nTucked away in Massachusetts, one man is making his life’s work out of those other life’s works. For the past three years, Jason Bailey has been hunting these catalogs down. He’s baffled librarians with his voluminous requests. He’s searched for libraries with liberal lending policies, so he can spend time with these pricey rare books. He’s scoured eBay and Amazon. He’s sought out a friend with a Ph.D. in Italian to decipher one rare catalog. \nHis mission: to turn them all into a proper digital database. \nA catalogue raisonné typically lists each piece’s title, dimensions, date, medium, location, provenance, exhibition history, condition and occasionally even more. Together, these represent a comprehensively large and remarkably rich set of data on the most beautiful, seminal and expensive works of modern art. But this data is scattered, unsearchable and unanalyzable, locked away in countless books high on dusty library shelves, or shrink-wrapped and bearing stupefying price tags at boutique bookshops. “It’s locked up in these old books — hard to find, out of print, not very dynamic,” Bailey said. “For all this talk about ‘big data,’ I’ve seen over and over again — you need the data.” \nThe A.C.I. Art Catalogue Index, top, is a list of all the painters, sculptors, paper artists, engravers and contemporary media artists between 1780 and the late 20th century with catalogues raisonnés. Below it are the individual catalogues raisonnés of Stuart Davis, Hans Hofmann, and Juan Gris, and a portion of Cy Twombly’s. \nOn a coffee table in his living room in Ashland, Massachusetts, amid the clutter of everyday life — books, power cables, beer bottles — sits a boxy, homemade frame of PVC pipes. In the center of the frame lies an angular cradle, holding open a large volume of a catalogue raisonné, its facing pages held flat by two clear plastic panes; a light dangles above. Flanking this rig are two high-end digital cameras that record the artwork data within. Each volume takes about two hours to scan. Bailey then ships the resulting PDF files to the internet, where he takes bids from freelancers who do the painstaking transcription. The data comes back in a spreadsheet, where Bailey cleans it. Finally, he takes it to his central database: ordered, searchable and analyzable. \nThis moonshot project is called Artnome (as in “genome”). 2 So far, Bailey says he has completely extracted, liberated and reassembled the data from the print catalogs of 35 major artists (including Cézanne, Dalí, Monet, O’Keeffe, Pollock and Rothko), and at least 10 more are currently in progress. \nOther art databases exist, of course. Artnet maintains a massive database of auction sales, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA recently made their own databases public. The Wildenstein Plattner Institute, an arts nonprofit in New York, is currently digitizing and publishing online a century’s worth of Impressionist archives. But “a database of complete known works across the most important art and artists of the 20th century,” as Bailey describes his goal, does not exist. \n“Everybody thought I was crazy to do it, which made me want to do it more,” he said. “A single raisonné across all artists is the Holy Grail.” \nEven a simple chart of Bailey’s data so far, a sampling of which he provided to FiveThirtyEight, reveals the artistic depth running beneath: the human-size color fields of Mark Rothko, the delicate intricacies of van Gogh, the panoramic abstractions of Lee Krasner. 3 “Just playing in the virgin snow, I’m able to discover some interesting things,” he said. \nComing from a family full of engineers, “I was sort of the black sheep,” Bailey said. When he and his friends skipped school, he would eschew more typical adolescent hijinks and read art history books in the woods instead. But he got his start in data collection at age 11, when his father taught him to use Excel so he could catalog his comic book and baseball card collections. He went to school for studio art and design, but his current day job is at a company called Tamr that unifies data for large companies. His art project was sparked after he listened to a book on tape about art forgeries on his commute to work. \nThe project is very much a work in progress. The list of interesting artists is endless, and the catalogs of Picasso and Francis Bacon are Bailey’s white whales at the moment. Picasso’s catalog, often called “the Zervos,” after its original publisher, is 33 volumes long and retails for $25,000. It contains information on over 16,000 Picasso pieces. Bacon’s catalog was published just last year, and retails for a relatively meager $1,300. Bailey is still on the hunt for the data locked on paper inside them. \nBailey said he’s received a warm reception from art scholars, and one I spoke with agreed that the project had potential. “To the extent that projects are collaborative across institutions or between scholars, independent researchers, and institutions to make those works available worldwide, that’s all to the public good,” Carole Ann Fabian, the director of the Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, told me. \nBut Bailey also said many were skeptical it could be done. “These are very complicated projects he’s talking about,” Fabian said. “He’s an enthusiast, and these are areas of extreme expertise that the field dedicates tremendous effort toward.” \nBailey made a cradle out of PVC pipes, left, to photograph the catalogs. He uses a bag full of cans, right, to keep it from tipping. \nUltimately, Bailey hopes Artnome can do for the art market what Zillow does for real estate. More than $45 billion worth of art was sold in 2016 — a lot of demand despite no comprehensive ledger of art’s supply side. Just how many Rothkos are there, anyway? And where are they? Who owns them? What are they titled? These are surprisingly difficult questions to answer. \nWhile Bailey is hoping to spark a “Moneyball” era for art, the traditional auction houses are still acting as scouts. His database could allow them to do all sorts of new things, though. He’s beginning to weave data on auction prices into his universal raisonné, adding market valuations to the art-historic descriptions. That data helped him argue that Christie’s was overvaluing its pre-sale estimate by millions of dollars for a Wassily Kandinsky painting it plans to sell this fall. (Christie’s did not respond to a request for comment.) And the auction houses have shown interest in data. Last year, Sotheby’s acquired the Mei Moses Art Indices, “a constantly updated database of 45,000 repeat sales of objects.” \nThe Artnome project thus far has relied on a long list of high technology unthinkable to de la Faille or the other assemblers of early catalogs — the internet, the gig economy, data science and interlinked databases. Bailey plans to leverage much more tech. For his next phase, he’s drawing from artificial intelligence , machine learning, image matching and a Slack community where art historians, art-loving programmers and deep learning specialists from around the world have flocked in recent days. In concert, these technologies could help gather, verify, match, unify and enrich this budding Holy Grail. \n“I don’t see it as a project that scales, long term, as one person’s crazy hobby,” Bailey said. \nDespite the mountainous engineering challenge, another potential hurdle remains: These catalogs, no matter how hard won, don’t belong to Bailey. He didn’t spend the grueling years their authors took assembling and editing them, or the expenses their publishers incurred publishing them — and he certainly doesn’t hold their copyrights. But Bailey was optimistic about the copyright issues, citing the scanning done by the Google Books project and reading he’d done on the matter. One copyright lawyer I spoke with was optimistic, too, citing the example of the periodic table of elements: It was really hard to come up with, but it isn’t copyrightable. Copyright protects expression, not facts. \nStill, Bailey offered a bit of gallows humor. “I don’t know if I’ll get blacklisted by libraries and have to wear a disguise,” he said. Bewigged or not, Bailey continues to pursue his “crazy hobby.” And as you read this, the database continues to grow. Footnotes ",

      "text": "Story by Morgan Starkey ,  Studio Writer Intern \nWith over 450 interns hired this summer across the nation, Adobe has an abundance of rising talent from all across the world. Our tech interns spend their summer here working on innovative projects that are applied directly to the business. Hear firsthand from these three interns about their projects and #AdobeLife experiences.\nJoyce Van Drost\nFull Stack Web Developer Intern \n\nWhen asked to describe her internship experience at Adobe this summer in one word, Joyce Van Drost, rising senior at Rutgers University, responded, “Rewarding.”  Joyce has lived on the East Coast her entire life, growing up on Staten Island, and attending university in New Jersey. When offered the internship to be a Full Stack Web Developer across the country in San Francisco, a place she had never visited, she couldn’t resist.\nJoyce initially started her college career in accounting, pursuing her love of math. But after a summer with Girls Who Code at Goldman Sachs, she discovered her true passion, and decided to pursue a career in technology. Through Girls Who Code, Joyce began to understand that computer science was not sitting behind a computer screen all day coding—a common misconception. “Computer science is about communicating and collaborating with peers to develop the best way to approach a problem.”\nAs a Full Stack Web Developer on the Adobe Stock team, Joyce was able to work on back-end coding and see the design changes her code made on the mobile site. “I was surprised by how much was involved,” she said of the challenging but rewarding work. Through her internship, Joyce found that her interest lies in mobile development and making the user experience flawless. “I found this internship rewarding because of the incredible people, and the real impact I was making.”\nBlake Wulfe\nData Science Research Intern \n\nBlake Wulfe is another impressive intern who works as a Data Science Researcher in the Systems Technology Lab. During his first quarter at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, he completed an independent study on machine learning in which he created an algorithm that could predict the outcome of job interviews. But during his study, he found that his true interest lied in artificial intelligence. So after graduating, Blake sought out a masters program where he could pursue research into AI. And Stanford University, which is in the heart of Silicon Valley, was the right match.\nAfter a recommendation from a friend, Blake came to Adobe with great interest in the artificial intelligence projects. Blake’s project focuses on personalized functionality within Adobe products. Specifically, he and fellow researchers are using imitation learning to design context-dependent macros for automatically performing recurring tasks such as cropping or styling photos. This approach of imitation learning has seen recent success in gaming and robotics, and Blake is hopeful that it can be applied to personalization within Adobe products.\nHis goal for the end of this internship is to write a research paper and present how this new method can be used. Of his experience, Blake said, “The most rewarding aspects of this internship is that I am perfectly aligned with what I want to do and what I am interested in. The number of passionate people I met and formed connections with has been an invaluable experience.”\nGagan Mand\nProduct Marketing Manager, Adobe Experience Manager Intern   \n\nConsider Gagan Mand a collector of degrees. Born and raised in India, she received her bachelors in engineering and chemical engineering. From there, she moved to the United States, attending the University of Illinois and pursuing her masters in aerospace engineering. After that, she spent four years working as an application engineer on the product delivery team at Siemens. “Over those four years, I had watched the product completely transform for customer needs. I felt so inspired by the product managers who created a roadmap for the product, that I decided to go back to school and earn my MBA at the University of Texas.”\nWhen she started applying for internships, Gagan had other attractive offers, but her interview experience at Adobe set this company apart from the rest. Gagan had the unique experience of attending the MBA Project Expo at Adobe last summer, in which she got to meet a variety of teams explaining the fascinating projects they worked on. “I met such incredible people who were visibly passionate about their work. Adobe is a big company in a startup mode. There is such a culture of growth and mutual respect that was genuine and obvious to me. Transitioning into this diverse and welcoming company felt very natural.” She was introduced to her project before summer and couldn’t have been more thrilled.\nThis summer she worked on creating a customer journey map for our Adobe Experience Manager customers and helped identify key focus areas for not only enhancing customer experience but also realizing faster time to value. “The most rewarding part of this summer, apart from the culture, is the work I am doing actually matters and will continue to be used once I go back to school. I was given a lot of freedom with this project, which was intimidating but also very exciting.” When asked to sum up her internship in one word, she responded, “Intellectually stimulating” because one word wasn’t enough. “When we think about Adobe, we only think about a few products, but Adobe has so much more to offer. I am constantly learning about new products. The most exciting part for me is the promise Adobe holds for the future.”\nPicture yourself at Adobe next Summer as an intern or University graduate?

      "text": "Data analytics set to become next big career dream Thousands of professionals from IT, non-IT sectors are signing up for data science courses August 17, 2017 Last Updated at 19:37 IST email this article Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy: \nhttp://mybs.in/2UY4shP ALSO READ AI, data analytics: IT cos look for new skill sets in prospective employees Not just Cognizant: Other IT firms may hire 40% fewer engineers this year Sify to look at AI, data analytics cos for inorganic growth: CEO Kamal Nath TCS ties up with LIBA to launch PGDM course on Business Analytics Strong Q4, but will HCL Technologies' stock re-rate? \nShivakumar C S (name changed), a Chennai-based professional with a technology firm, did not mind spending a nearly Rs 5 lakh for his data science course. He felt it was essential for his career progression even after spending more than a decade as a banker. \nSpeaking about his current role, Shivakumar says he is focused on banking analytics and finds the work more interesting than the previous one. \nTake the case of Shayak Das (name changed). A Bengaluru-based techie with nearly nine years of experience. Shayak says doing a short-term course on cloud computing was as important as going on a monthly cycling trek. \nDas, who has worked with a number of Information Technology (IT) services firms and a product company as well, felt having the right skills on cloud was essential for the kind of work he does. He paid Rs 11,000 upfront for a one-month course and never bothered whether the employer might bear the cost. \nExamples are plenty. Thousands of professionals both from IT and non-IT sectors across different cities in India are enrolling for data analytics courses. \nOf the 71,000 professionals who signed up for such courses at Simplilearn during the past one year, a large chunk of them opted for courses on data analytics and big data and at least three-fourth of them are IT professionals. \nAs the IT services industry foresees a shift in business towards digital and services delivery through technologies such as cloud, more professionals within the sector look to gain new skills in digital technology-based projects. \nData science is one of the most lucrative one and professionals with 8-15 years of experience from different sectors are enrolling for data science courses as they see the current roles on jobs varying from banking to manufacturing or software maintenance are getting automated faster. \n\"I realised the kind of work I do can soon get automated. That is when I opted for data science for a greater future,\" said Shivakumar. \nMohan Lakhamraju, Founder and CEO, Great Learning, said he has seen a \"three-fold rise\" in enrollment during the past one year. \nHe believes IT firms in particular are \"hiring more people than they are laying off, but they are hiring in new roles as the nature of work is changing\". \n\"While we hear two prominent Indian banks have created a list of 16,000 employees to train them in data science, we have 100-150 senior employees on an average from IT services companies such as TCS, Cognizant, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IBM, Capgemini, Infosys, and others,\" said Lakhamraju. \nKashyap Dalal, chief business officer, Simplilearn, said the company has seen enrollment driven by both employers and employees. \"Employees are coming to do such courses from a career point of view. There is definitely a transition in terms of the projects IT companies are getting such as cloud movement of IT infrastructure, doing more work on cyber security. This translates into a greater demand for data analytics courses,\" said Dalal. \nOther courses on demand include cloud computing, machine learning and digital marketing. \nLakhamraju explained that data science courses at Great Learning consist of offline and online sessions with 2-3 monthly classroom sessions. During a 12-month long course, candidates work on a real life project for 4-5 months. They solve critical business problems that can help them in career progression. \nData science course durations vary from 3-12 months across online and offline institutions and the course fee ranges between Rs 2.5 to Rs 4 lakh. \nHyderabad and Bengaluru-based Insofe or International School of Engineering have close to 60 per cent candidates from IT services firms. The institute claims to have 1,500 enrolled candidates, who have opted for data analytics courses. \nSanthosh Kumar, manager business development, Insofe, said the average work experience of these candidates is 11 years and they vary between 0 and 20 years. \nWhile Insofe is an official analytics training partner for one of the prominent IT services firms, firms such as Honeywell, Flipkart have nominated their employees to take data analytics courses. \nWhat makes data analytics a more interesting career option is the government's push towards digitalisation and other measures such as the Aadhaar linking of services. \n\"With new trends such as demonetisation, Aadhaar being made compulsory, the government opening up APIs and sharing information, there is so much more information and thus, data science has a bigger opportunity. The shift in its acceptance is seen towards a lot of traditional companies from social media and internet companies. Data Analytics itself is going to become an industry,\" said Dalal.",

      "text": "PDF Science must re-evaluate its open-data policy after retracting a controversial study on microplastics and fish in May (“Editorial Retraction,” J. Berg, 26 May, p. 812 and “Fishy business,” M. Enserink, News Feature, 24 March, p. 1254). The only computer containing the study's raw data was allegedly stolen and no backups existed on another machine or an online repository. Many are left wondering how this could happen in an era of cloud computing and open data. Science currently has a two-step editorial policy to promote data availability and research transparency ( 1 ). First, “before publication, large data sets must be deposited in an approved database and an accession number…included in the published paper.” Second, “after publication, all data [and code] necessary to understand, assess, and extend the conclusions of the manuscript must be available to any reader of Science .” Unfortunately, two loopholes weaken the effectiveness of this policy. First, it is unclear why “small data sets” are exempt from archival before publication given that they are simple to share and equally important in verifying research results (as the above case demonstrates). Second, research shows that individual scientists cannot be trusted to reliably preserve their data and share them upon request ( 2 , 3 ). Compounding this problem is the fact that publishers seldom state the consequences of breaching their policies. For example, does failure to provide raw data post-publication lead to the automatic retraction of the paper? The solution to avoid data disappearing is simple: Journals must mandate and enforce data archival on a recognized, online repository at the time of submission. Only editors and reviewers would have access during peer review; the data would be made generally accessible upon publication. Publishing verifiable research is a tenet of scientific progress and, ultimately, journals are responsible for guaranteeing compliance with their open-data policy. At a minimum, this responsibility involves a cursory check of the underlying data and ensuring that all data are available for reviewers to assess ( 4 ). Science publishes many papers describing major breakthroughs, but these extraordinary claims must be supported by extraordinary evidence. This includes, first and foremost, a complete and understandable data set that is open to reviewers and, ultimately, becomes open to scientists and the public.
