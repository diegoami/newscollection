      "text": "Those hoping to find out if their Social Security number and other identifying info was stolen, along with a potential 143 million other American’s data won’t find answers from Equifax.\nIn what is an unconscionable move by the credit report company, the checker site, hosted by Equifax product TrustID, seems to be telling people at random they may have been affected by the data breach.\nI started noticing most people who’d tested out the site in my Facebook and Twitter feeds had been given the message that they may have been part of the millions whose information was affected. It stood to reason that was likely, given the scope of the leak would affect possibly one out every two people I know in the country.\nHowever, I then decided to try it out for myself. First, I entered my real information…and received the bad news.\n“Based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident,” the site said.\nI was then encouraged on the next line to continue my enrollment in TrustedID Premier. I was not aware I was enrolling in anything simply by giving my information. I had been instructed to add my last name and the last six digits of my Social Security number only to find out if I’d been impacted.\nSo then I decided to test the system with a different last name and six random numbers. I used the more popular English spelling of my last name for this purpose, entering “Burr” instead of “Buhr” and entered six random numbers I don’t even remember now.\nSure enough, this made-up person had also been impacted. I tried it over and over again and got the same message. The only time I did not get the message I’d been impacted was when I entered “Elmo” as the last name and “123456” as my Social Security number.\nSome of my colleagues also tried to fool the system and came up with different outcomes. Sometimes, after entering a made-up name, the site said they had been impacted. A few times it said they were not.\nOthers have tweeted they received different answers after entering the same information.\nThe assignment seems random. But, nevertheless, they were still asked to continue enrolling in TrustID.\nWhat this means is not only are none of the last names tied to your Social Security number, but there’s no way to tell if you were really impacted.\nIt’s clear Equifax’s goal isn’t to protect the consumer or bring them vital information. It’s to get you to sign up for its revenue-generating product TrustID.\nEarlier it was revealed executives had sold stock in the company before going public with the leak. We also found TrustID’s Terms of Service to be disturbing. The wording is such that anyone signing up for the product is barred from suing the company after.\nThis language is unacceptable and unenforceable. My staff has already contacted @Equifax to demand that they remove it. https://t.co/vT0x7f5Xhc\n— Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) September 8, 2017\nNew York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has hammered Equifax for using language meant to discourage arbitration and is asking Equifax for answers over the data breach. The company has stated since it would not bar consumers from joining breach-related lawsuits.\nNo doubt, those who sold company stock before publicly admitting the issues are going to face some legal trouble of their own as well.\nI’ve since reached out to the company but so far for this story and inquiries I’ve made in the last two days, I have yet to hear back.\nThese actions, and many others, are disgraceful, especially for a company of this size and responsibility and I truly hope Equifax feels the heat they are under for mishandling what is the largest data breach in the history of the U.S.\nFeatured Image: REUTERS/Tami Chappell ",

      "text": "Hackers Gain Direct Access to US Power Grid Controls Hydro lines at sunset. Getty Images \nIn an era of hacker attacks on critical infrastructure, even a run-of-the-mill malware infection on an electric utility’s network is enough to raise alarm bells. But the latest collection of power grid penetrations went far deeper: Security firm Symantec is warning that a series of recent hacker attacks not only compromised energy companies in the US and Europe but also resulted in the intruders gaining hands-on access to power grid operations---enough control that they could have induced blackouts on American soil at will. \nSymantec on Wednesday revealed a new campaign of attacks by a group it is calling Dragonfly 2.0, which it says targeted dozens of energy companies in the spring and summer of this year. In more than 20 cases, Symantec says the hackers successfully gained access to the target companies’ networks. And at a handful of US power firms and at least one company in Turkey---none of which Symantec will name---their forensic analysis found that the hackers obtained what they call operational access: control of the interfaces power company engineers use to send actual commands to equipment like circuit breakers, giving them the ability to stop the flow of electricity into US homes and businesses. \n“There’s a difference between being a step away from conducting sabotage and actually being in a position to conduct sabotage ... being able to flip the switch on power generation,” says Eric Chien, a Symantec security analyst. “We’re now talking about on-the-ground technical evidence this could happen in the US, and there’s nothing left standing in the way except the motivation of some actor out in the world.” \nNever before have hackers been shown to have that level of control of American power company systems, Chien notes. The only comparable situations, he says, have been the repeated hacker attacks on the Ukrainian grid that twice caused power outages in the country in late 2015 and 2016, the first known hacker-induced blackouts. The Usual Suspects \nSecurity firms like FireEye and Dragos have pinned those Ukrainian attacks on a hacker group known as Sandworm, believed to be based in Russia. But Symantec stopped short of blaming the more recent attacks on any country or even trying to explain the hackers' motives. Chien says the company has found no connections between Sandworm and the intrusions it has tracked. Nor has it directly connected the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign to the string of hacker intrusions at US power companies---including a Kansas nuclear facility---known as Palmetto Fusion, which unnamed officials revealed in July and later tied to Russia . \nChien does note, however, that the timing and public descriptions of the Palmetto Fusion hacking campaigns match up with its Dragonfly findings. “It’s highly unlikely this is just coincidental,” Chien says. But he adds that while the Palmetto Fusion intrusions included a breach of a nuclear power plant, the most serious DragonFly intrusions Symantec tracked penetrated only non-nuclear energy companies, which have less strict separations of their internet-connected IT networks and operational controls. \nAs Symantec's report on the new intrusions details , the company has tracked the Dragonfly 2.0 attacks back to at least December of 2015, but found that they ramped up significantly in the first half of 2017, particularly in the US, Turkey, and Switzerland. Its analysis of those breaches found that they began with spearphishing emails that tricked victims into opening a malicious attachment---the earliest they found was a fake invitation to a New Year's Eve party---or so-called watering hole attacks that compromise a website commonly visited by targets to hack victims' computers. \nThose attacks were designed to harvest credentials from victims and gain remote access to their machines. And in the most successful of those cases, including several instances in the US and one in Turkey, the attackers penetrated deep enough to screenshot the actual control panels for their targets' grid operations---what Symantec believes was a final step in positioning themselves to sabotage those systems at will. \"That’s exactly what you’d do if you were to attempt sabotage,\" he says. \"You’d take these sorts of screenshots to understand what you had to do next, like literally which switch to flip.\" \nAnd if those hackers did gain the ability to cause a blackout in the US, why did they stop short? Chien reasons that they may have been seeking the option to cause an electric disruption but waiting for an opportunity that would be most strategically useful---say, if an armed conflict broke out, or potentially to issue a well-timed threat that would deter the US from using its own hacking capabilities against another foreign nation's critical infrastructure. \"If these attacks are from a nation state,\" Chien says, \"one would expect sabotage only in relation to a political event.\" The Ukrainian Precedent \nNot every group of hackers has shown that kind of restraint. Hackers now believed to be the Russian group Sandworm used exactly the sort of access to electricity control interfaces that Symantec describes Dragonfly having to shut off the power to a quarter million Ukrainians in December 2015. In one case they took over the remote help desk tool of a Ukrainian energy utility to hijack engineers' mouse controls and manually clicked through dozens of circuit breakers, turning off the power to tens of thousands of people as the engineers watched helplessly. infrastructure Nineteen legislators say the discovery of automated grid-disruption malware in Ukraine means the White House isn't doing enough to protect critical infrastructure. Security \nFeds' Smart Grid Race Leaves Cybersecurity in the Dust Amid the government-funded rush to upgrade America’s aging electric system to a smart grid comes a strange confluence of press releases this week by the White House and the University of Illinois. Tuesday morning, President Obama, speaking at Florida Power and Light (FPL) facilities, announced $3.4 billion in grants to utility companies, municipal districts and […] Infrastructure \nSquirrels Keep Menacing the Power Grid. But at Least It's Not the Russians A site that chronicles animals versus the power grid makes a good point about cyberwar hype, but an attack would still be serious business. \nOperations like that one and a more automated blackout attack a year later have made Russia the first suspect in any grid-hacking incident. But Symantec notes that the hackers mostly used freely available tools and existing vulnerabilities in software rather than previously unknown weaknesses, making any attribution more difficult. They found some Russian-language strings of code in the malware used in the intrusions, but also some hints of French. They note that either language could be a \"false flag\" meant to throw off investigators. \nIn naming the hacking campaign Dragonfly, however, Symantec does tie it to an earlier, widely analyzed set of intrusions also aimed at the US and European energy sectors, which stretched from as early as 2010 to 2014. The hackers behind that series of attacks, called Dragonfly by Symantec but also known by the names Energetic Bear, Iron Liberty, and Koala, shared many of the same characteristics as the more recent Dragonfly 2.0 attacks, Symantec says, including infection methods, two pieces of malware used in the intrusions, and energy sector victims. And both the security firm Crowdstrike and the US government have linked those earlier Dragonfly attacks with the Kremlin---a report published by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI last December included the group on its list of known Russian-government hacking operations. \nSymantec says it has assisted the power companies that experienced the deepest penetrations, helping them eject the hackers from their networks. The firm also sent warnings to more than a hundred companies about the Dragonfly 2.0 hackers, as well as to the Department of Homeland Security and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which is responsible for the stability of the US power grid. NERC didn't immediate answer WIRED's request for comment on Symantec's findings, but DHS spokesperson Scott McConnell wrote in a statement that \"DHS is aware of the report and is reviewing it,\" and \"at this time there is no indication of a threat to public safety.\" \nBut Symantec's Chien nonetheless warns any company that thinks it may be a target of the hackers to not only remove any malware it has identified as the group's calling card but also to refresh their staff's credentials. Given the hackers' focus on stealing those passwords, even flushing all malware out of a targeted network might not prevent hackers from gaining a new foothold if they still have employees' working logins. \nThe Dragonfly hackers remain active even today, Chien warns, and electric utilities should be on high alert. Given that the group has, in some form, been probing and penetrating energy utility targets for the past seven years, don't expect them to stop now. ",

      "text": "China’s big electric vehicle push is about to get even bigger: The country is planning to end the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles entirely, with regulators working currently on a timetable of when the ban will ultimately take effect, according to Bloomberg .\nChina is the world’s largest auto market, with 28.03 million vehicles sold last year, a boost in demand of 13.7 percent vs. 2015 sales numbers. The nation has already done a lot to incentivize manufacturers to develop and sell new EVs, including allowing foreign automakers to create a third joint venture with local automakers (a standard requirement for doing business in the country for auto OEMs) so long as it’s dedicated to the creation of EVs exclusively.\nThe government has also created a number of incentive programs for OEMs, including subsidies. This will add to its positive efforts to drive more EV sales in China with the ultimate negative condition on the other side – at some point, automakers just won’t be able to do business at all in the country if they’re still selling a mix of fossil fuel and electrified vehicles.\nThis isn’t the first time a governing body has said it would eventually phase out the sale of traditional fuel vehicles: France said it will stop selling fossil fuel cars by 2040 in July, and the UK has committed to the same timeline for sales of those vehicles.\nCritics have suggested that a ban on fossil fuel vehicles is likely impractical, because it would stretch an already taxed supply chain, which has some hard limits in terms of the volume of lithium available for lithium-ion battery cells, for instance. But automakers are already responding to this rising trend with expanded EV model lineups and, in the case of Volvo for instance, plans to eventually sell exclusively all-electric or hybrid cars.\nChina’s timeline for establishing this ban will be crucial in terms of how quickly we see the global shift to EVs occur, as it’s going to be an immense lever in terms of automaker strategic planning internationally, as well as in the country.\nFeatured Image: Marianna / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE ",

      "text": "Tesla extends range on cars to help owners avoid Hurricane Irma It's only temporary, but it might help save lives. Save David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nTesla may have software-limited the battery capacities of some cars to upsell owners to pricier trim levels, but it's now clear that the company is willing to lift that limit during a crisis. The EV maker has confirmed to Electrek that it temporarily unlocked the full battery capacity on 60kWh Model S and Model X cars in Florida to give them the full 75kWh and help them escape Hurricane Irma . As you might guess, the extra range (about 30 to 40 miles) could be vital -- in one case, it helped an owner in a mandatory evacuation area optimize his escape route and get out in a timely fashion. \nIt's good to know that Tesla has the option of unlocking batteries in special circumstances, especially since buying a permanent unlock could cost several thousand dollars. You wouldn't want to have to stop at a Supercharger station (many of which were still running on September 9th, thankfully) with a life-threatening storm bearing down on you. \nWith that said, it does illustrate the potential issues with capping EV batteries using software. At what point does an automaker (not just Tesla) decide that an unlock is important? There are smaller-scale emergencies where offering the full capacity might still be helpful. It's not as pressing a question for Tesla now that the company isn't selling cars with software battery caps, but it's something that manufacturers may need to account for if they consider implementing software limits in the future.",

      "text": "Tesla has pushed an over-the-air update to some of its vehicles in Florida that lets those cars go just a liiiittle bit farther, thus helping their owners get that much farther away from the devastation of Hurricane Irma.\nWondering how that’s even possible?\nUp until a few months ago, Tesla sold a 60kWh version of its Model S and Model X vehicles — but the battery in those cars was actually rated at 75kWh. The thinking: Tesla could offer a more affordable 60kWh version to those who didn’t need the full range of the 75kWh battery — but to keep things simple, they’d just use the same 75kWh battery and lock it on the software side. If 60kWh buyers found they needed more range and wanted to upgrade later, they could… or if Tesla wanted to suddenly bestow owners with some extra range in case of an emergency, they could.\nAnd that’s what’s happening here.\nAs first noticed by Tesla owners on Reddit , the company has pushed a “temporary update” to vehicles within the evacuation zones that bumps the 60kWh models up to 75kWh.\nOn the road, according to Elektrek , this battery bump works out to about 30 miles of additional range on a full charge. If that little bit of range helps even one person avoid injury or get their loved ones out safely, I’d say its worth whatever work this required.\nAlas, the upgrade won’t stick around forever — Tesla generally charges at least $5,000 for the permanent equivalent. Members on the Tesla Motors Club fan forum report that the temporary update will be reversed on September 16th.\n(Meanwhile, in case any gas-powered vehicle owners in the path of the hurricane end up on this page: GasBuddy has rolled out a tool meant to help Floridians find gas stations near them that still have fuel. And if you can get out, please do. )\n ",

      "text": "Elon Musk has shared a photo of the SpaceX spacesuit the company has designed in-house. This is the second photo shared by Musk of the new spacesuit design created by the company, and the first to feature the suit’s full-body look.\nThe first photo focused on the head and shoulders of the outfit , depicting the full tinted face mask of the helmet, and the angular shoulders and black and white design. This one puts the suit into context next to the Crew Dragon capsule, which is the vehicle staff wearing the suit will use to make the trip on SpaceX’s first crewed launches.\nAstronaut spacesuit next to Crew Dragon\nA post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Sep 8, 2017 at 1:04pm PDT\nThis full-length shot of the suit reveals the glove and boot design for the first time, along with the pants, which feature flex zones in the knee area for mobility when bending. It also looks like there are similar padded areas in the back in black to help provide comfort while seated in the capsule.\nThe boots looks fairly lightweight, probably also optimized for mobility. These suits aren’t designed for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) after all – they’re created to protect the astronauts while they’re in the capsule, and when moving over to other vehicles (like the ISS) under pressurized conditions, rather than being exposed to vacuum.\nHere’s the earlier helmet shot:\nFirst picture of SpaceX spacesuit. More in days to follow. Worth noting that this actually works (not a mockup). Already tested to double vacuum pressure. Was incredibly hard to balance esthetics and function. Easy to do either separately.\nA post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Aug 23, 2017 at 12:59am PDT\n ",

      "text": "At Harvey Mudd College, the Ratio of Women in Computer Science Increased from 10% to 40% in 5 Years In that first visit to Senior House, students told Survilaite how the privacy browser Tor had been invented by an undergrad named Roger Dingledine right here. Nirvana had played in this room on their first US tour in 1990. They showed her where Corbett had lived and where a student had once dumped hundreds of bags of sand in her room and made a beach for people to relax on when they were stressed. Survilaite could soon meet all of them, and more, when house alumni returned for Steer Roast to offer advice about life and career. In this way, the residents explained to her, Senior House was more than just a place she could live for four years; it would be a permanent home she could return to forever, a network of people who would always be connected by their shared values and love of this place. She wanted in. It wasn’t an upsell. When Steer Roast rolled around that spring, Survilaite found herself chatting with Dingledine, the creator of Tor. “Steer Roast is the way I stay connected to the MIT community,” he says. He goes to meet people like Survilaite. “I hang out at the fire pit at 6 am and tell them stories,” he says. He tells them how all good ideas start in a counterculture. He tells them how he and his Senior House friends stayed up night after night in the late ’90s trying to make a way for people to communicate anonymously to protect dissent. Survilaite was a convert. “It was the first time in my life that I felt like I could actually belong anywhere,” she says. \nMIT senior Cory Johnson says Senior House was the first place he was allowed to be himself. Timothy O'Connell for WIRED The Fight In June 2016—just as the school year was coming to a close—Survilaite, along with her friend Johnson and the other residents of Senior House, began to understand that their dorm was in the university’s crosshairs. On June 10, MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart sent them an email explaining that there was troubling evidence that the residents of Senior House were struggling on several fronts. Registrar data showed that the hall’s graduation rate was lower than any dorm on campus—21.1 percent of Senior House students were failing to graduate, versus the campus average of 7.7 percent. In addition, the email cited data that suggested higher-than-average drug use in the house. The email to students was part of what appeared to be a coordinated public relations attack on the century-old dorm. “They sent the students who lived in Senior House the email at, let’s say, 11 am, and simultaneously they posted a news article on the MIT news site and then five minutes later they started emailing our parents—and then all undergraduate parents,” Johnson says. For many Senior House students, this was the first email their parents had ever received from the school, and it was alarming. “Imagine, a lot of these kids live in fear of their parents. They don’t fit in with their families, and now this letter is the only piece of correspondence they ever receive from the university?” Feldmeier says. The reaction among parents was predictable: Many told their kids to move out of Senior House. Chancellor Barnhart says that parents, who were in many cases paying the bills, deserved to know what was going on with their children. At this point, Barnhart says, the intention was not to shut down the dorm. Instead, over that summer, Senior House student leaders, faculty advisers, alumni, and the administration began working together on what Barnhart called a turnaround project. The administration was committed to a long-term effort. “This is not even just a one-year effort,” Barnhart remembers believing and expressing at the time. “It’s a multiyear effort because it’s about changing culture and dynamics.” The chancellor created a committee of 47 people—faculty, staff, and students, including some who lived at Senior House—to run the turnaround. Looking toward the start of the 2016–17 academic year, Barnhart said that the house would be closed to incoming freshman, but that those already slated to live in the dorm could return. Throughout the fall, working groups of the committee made progress, writing a report in January 2017 about positive changes they had made, including placing a mental health professional within Senior House for students in need of counseling. This was especially helpful for Survilaite, who was having a hard time during this period. She’d been in an abusive relationship, and her partner had moved into her room at Senior House. With the help of her friends and this mental health professional, she was able to end the relationship and kick him out. The committee also focused on improving tutoring, addiction services, campus outreach, and making the house a safer place for residents and visitors. But then something happened. Turnaround meetings, which had consumed the student leadership the previous semester, stopped. Citing privacy concerns, the administration refused to disclose what precisely had happened, but Barnhart told the student newspaper The Tech that “we received highly credible reports of unsafe and illegal behavior in Senior House.” In an interview with WIRED, she says “because of what happened in the spring we just felt that we didn’t have that [turnaround] option anymore. We felt that we needed to do what we needed to do.” At that point the administration began what it called a formal review, including one-on-one interviews with all house residents. Barnhart announced this process at 10 pm in a hastily called meeting with all house residents. In that meeting, the students asked Barnhart if they could have a lawyer present in the one-on-one interviews and were told they could not. Students in the house say these mandatory interviews felt like interrogations, with questions centering on whether drugs were sold or used in the house. “This was Lord of the Flies ,” Johnson says. “They wanted us to turn on each other.” After the review, the turnaround was deemed a failure and five sophomore Senior House students were referred to the disciplinary committee. The unconfirmed story around the house was that these students had, using a group chat application, arranged to buy cocaine for a party. When asked if this was the incident that halted the turnaround and prompted the review, Barnhart declined to comment on the specifics and said no single event would have led to her decision to halt the turnaround or kick the undergraduates out of the house. Then she added, “This happening—especially as we were working so hard to address exactly these issues—led us to the idea that this was unworkable.” That spring Steer Roast was cancelled and Senior House students and alumni went on red alert. Thousands of alumni signed open letters to the administration, which they published in The Tech , urging Steer Roast to be reinstated and the house to be protected. The whole Senior House network had a feeling that, after years of the house and the administration being increasingly at odds, its days might now be numbered. As the school year drew to a close, students staged sit-ins. Senior House supporters started websites as part of the campaign to save the dorm. Meanwhile, professors who thought the house should be closed wrote op-eds in The Tech arguing that the house was a negatively self-reinforcing environment that was putting its residents at risk. In July 2017, Barnhart announced that the dorm known as Senior House would effectively cease to exist. She’d decided that, starting this fall, the building would be used as graduate student housing. Over the summer, former Senior House residents were put in a housing lottery to find new accommodations. The administration painted over murals and covered others up with whiteboards. Feldmeier watched from his office as the story of Senior House written onto its walls was whitewashed. One way to kill a culture, he says: “With lots of white paint.” \nSenior House alum Michael Potash (at the wheel) and peers during a Steer Roast celebration in the early ’70s.

Courtesy Geeta Dayal Cultural Shift MIT’s dismantling of Senior House is part of a nationwide trend on college campuses, a shift that places a premium on safety, orderliness, and minimal bad publicity above all. Experts trace the roots of this shift to the 1980s. Since then, college tuition has skyrocketed and with it the competition for students who can afford it. Parents footing the bill are paying a lot more attention. The world has become more litigious and more corporate. All of this has led to an atmosphere in which university administrations have little margin for error when it comes to student safety or even bad publicity. And in this risk-averse atmosphere, places like Senior House, Eclectic, and Ricketts are increasingly viewed as unacceptable liabilities. “I first noticed this paternalistic ethos when I was doing some lectures at Vanderbilt University,” says sociologist Frank Furedi of the University of Kent and author of the book_ What’s Happened to the University?_ “There were all these campaigns being organized across America against drinking beer,” he says. “And I remembered that when I was in college the whole point was to get drunk.” The shift on campus parallels larger cultural changes. “The horizon of adulthood is getting extended,” says Princeton sociologist Dalton Conley, who contends that the knowledge economy means people need more and more schooling, which in turn extends the length of adolescence. This has led to a trend of administrations attempting to control every aspect of students’ lives. They employ risk officers to assess liability; they increasingly punish students for things that happen off campus or even over the summer. Take Harvard, for instance, which this year rescinded offers of admission to students based on comments they made on Facebook. At MIT, since students live on campus all four years, this overreach is especially robust. “Your social life, your meals, almost every aspect of your life operates within that campus,” Conley says. “It becomes more and more of a total institution. Like a prison.” This sets up a naturally combative relationship, especially in an environment as academically difficult as MIT. “It’s you, the student, against the institute,” Dingledine says. “It’s, How do we all get through this?” One way they get through it is by depending on their dorm families. “I can’t tell you how many times I heard that Senior House saved a student’s life,” Feldmeier says. He points out that despite MIT’s high suicide rates—12.6 per 100,000 students in the years between 2010 and 2015 (the national collegiate average is 7.5)—Senior House hasn’t had a suicide in more than 20 years. This isn’t surprising. People from marginalized groups do better when they find each other, according to psychological research. “Belonging to groups has really positive consequences, especially for mental and physical health,” says Dominic Packer, associate professor of psychology at LeHigh University, who studies group dynamics and the effects of ostracism. But groups like Senior House, which define themselves by being different, also run the risk of becoming highly conformist, Packer says. The punk rock movement is a particularly vivid example of this phenomenon. “They self-describe as being different, but from the outside they all look the same,” he says. Barnhart and the administration allege that those norms were exactly the problem in Senior House—that the strong culture in the dorm, far from being welcoming and supportive as the students contend, had become toxic, a negatively reinforcing environment. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Undergraduates and graduates who lived in the house in the past 15 years say drug use there was no more prevalent than in other dorms or colleges. That’s in sharp contrast to the experience of current MIT professor Mike Short, who lived in the house one summer and wrote to the student newspaper in defense of the administration’s decision. “In my brief three months living at Haus back in 2002, I was simultaneously drawn in by the culture, and strongly repelled by the rampant use of hard drugs and their effects on the people around me,” he wrote. Others say that if that was ever the case in the past, it no longer is today. “In my experience, there were fewer drugs at Senior House in the last three years than other places,” says a graduate student resident adviser who asked to be quoted anonymously for fear of administrative retribution. “Plus you have to remember they may have artists and different kinds of people, but we’re still talking about MIT kids here. These are nerds who mostly play video games and study and watch live streams of Alpha Go,” the resident adviser says. \nA knit chair cover adorned with the house's signature symbol, the skull. Timothy O'Connell for WIRED Holding Out Hope These nerds did not go quietly. Beyond the letter-writing campaigns, the calls, and the sit-ins, students and alumni held out hope throughout the summer that the administration would reverse its decision. One reason they thought they had a chance was that some of the data purportedly showing that drugs were a problem in the house had been obtained by ethically questionable means—even according to Barnhart. In her original correspondence with the Senior House community, and in subsequent in-person meetings with the house, Barnhart emphasized that the conclusion that Senior House needed a turnaround was based on rigorous data—both the graduation rate data from the registrar’s office and a campus-wide survey students had taken in 2015. The questionnaire, the Healthy Minds Survey, was administered by the University of Michigan. Many schools around the country give it to students as a way to pinpoint problems on campus and decide how best to allocate resources. When MIT administered it in 2015, they told students that it was a confidential survey intended to help them. One of the chancellor’s assistants who had lived in Senior House when she was an undergraduate went to Senior House and specifically requested that the residents take it. They did, in large numbers. What they didn’t know—and what they couldn’t have known from reading the consent form that accompanied it—was that MIT had embedded metadata that allowed the administration to pinpoint the location of those filling out the questionnaire, enabling them to segment the results by dorm. The only question about dorm type in the survey was vague—“What kind of dorm do you live in? Small, large, off campus?”—but by tracking the metadata, Barnhart and the administration were able to see exactly where respondents lived. It was this data that enabled Barnhart to see what she called a troubling hot spot of drug use. “If it wasn’t a direct violation, it was at least a violation of the spirit of informed consent,” Johnson says. Senior House defenders tried to use this issue to attack the administration’s closure of the dorm. “I am extremely angry that MIT used data obtained in a questionable manner to inform their policies with regards to any of their students, regardless of their residence,” wrote MIT parent Elizabeth Glaser in an op-ed in The Tech . Though her son was not part of Senior House, he took the survey and was upset about how it had been used. Glaser, herself an expert in research ethics, took it upon herself to contact the creators of the survey and review its methodology. It was she who discovered the metadata. \nMurals were an important part of Senior House's identity. Courtesy Senior House Joseph Sokol-Margolis Critics of the administration also took issue with the data purportedly showing Senior House had a relatively low graduation rate. Some worry it was based only on where students lived their freshman year, not taking into account that some people do switch dorms. Barnhart says the data accounted for this. When WIRED asked for access to the data to analyze the methods, the administration declined. More troubling to critics is that, based on the way the data was presented to the student body, it doesn’t appear to take into account that the students in Senior House tended to be marginalized in one way or another—and that those students tend to have a lower graduation rate. Barnhart says that the school took that into account as well, looking at marginalized groups in other houses. Again, it’s hard to judge who is correct without access to the raw data or detailed information about who and how it was analyzed. As school began again last week, Senior House was gone. It’s just 70 Amherst Street now. Was Senior House a toxic environment full of drug dealers and drunks? A respite in an intellectual gauntlet? An artistic outlet? A nihilistic void? It depends on whom you ask. Alumna and current students describe a community that helped each other, that made people feel safe enough to talk about their real problems. Over and over again people say Senior House was the first place they’d ever not felt judged. What they are describing is, in many ways, a safe place. And yet it was the claim that the dorm was dangerous that led the administration to shut it down. Johnson got lucky. He’s moving into the student residence next door, East Campus, with a few other Senior House expats. Survilaite had hoped to live there too—cockroaches and all—but there was no room. She’s moving into a co-ed fraternity off campus instead. As Senior House students spread out across campus this year, former advisers worry that they’ll be at even greater risk. They can reach out to MIT’s mental health services if they need it, the chancellor says. Survilaite plans to. Others won’t be so easy to track, like the former president of the house, who has opted to take a year off after the struggles of the past year. That’s not an option for Survilaite or Johnson. They are going to get their degrees, and even without a courtyard to roast a steer, they are going to hold on to each other. “I’m never going to let go of these people. They are my family. We belong together,” Johnson says. When school ends, they’ll head out into the big wide world, where building a nurturing community sometimes feels hard. Maybe the invisible threads of the internet will help bind them. Maybe Senior House alums will meet up in different cities to drink beer and trade stories of Steer Roasts past or find themselves across from each other at tech company boardroom tables, the memory of that shared place a secret tie between them. Maybe, just maybe, their weird community will persist, away from the place that once rooted it. But it’ll be something else. Something different. \nBuilt in 1916, Senior House was an undergrad dorm for 101 years. Today it's known simply as 70 Amherst Street.

      "text": "Advertisement Every company is a tech company, and that’s a big problem. Or rather, either every company is a tech company but most suck at it, or most aren’t tech companies but should be. Either way, we’re gonna have a bad time. Stock photo companies oughta be making more images of hackers because that cat burglar / hoodie dude behind a computer isn’t going to cut it when sh*t hits the fan on a weekly basis.\nSomehow, no one seemed to realize that connecting the Internet to everything was a terrible idea despite also being a great idea. We built information super-highways…yay, great…but most businesses forgot the guardrails.\nThe Equifax disaster is just warning shot compared to what’s to come.\nIt used to be that getting hacked or breached meant you had to change all your passwords. Attackers hit tech-first companies that at least had a basic understanding of security, and a limited amount of your immutable personal information. The Yahoo breaches from 2014 and 2015 that impacted over 1 billion users were huge, but not nearly as harmful as what happens now.\nToday, the hacks and breaches are hitting banking and credit companies, government databases, voting machines, and public utility infrastructure. That stolen data can’t always be changed, like your date of birth. Unless the government decides to reissue everyone a new social security number, once it’s stolen, it’s permanently vulnerable to exploitation.\nCredit cards, a chain and an open padlock is seen in front of displayed Equifax logo in this illustration taken September 8, 2017. (Photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)\nFor a quick recap, the Equifax breach hackers stole data including the full names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, home addresses and more from 143 million Americans. That data could be used to steal people’s identities, take out fraudulent loans, or power social engineering attacks where hackers call your bank or cell phone carrier and use info only you should have to trick them into providing access to your accounts.\nA brief look back on Techmeme surfaces plenty of other hair-raising attacks.\nHacker group Dragonfly has penetrated operational networks of energy companies that control power grids in the US and Europe, which could allow them to disrupt utilties to hundreds of millions of people An indefensible vulnerability in all modern cars could let attackers affect sensors, airbags, and anti-lock brakes. Hackers penetrated voting systems before the 2016 presidential elections, but local officials weren’t warned and the systems haven’t been properly investigated for malware or alterations since . Hackers are fooling mobile carriers into letting them change the phone associated with a phone number, allowing attackers to empty people’s cryptocurrency wallets German voting machines can be hacked to change the vote tallies And those are just a few of the headlines from the past month. We have years or decades of this to come.\nThat’s why we need every company to become a good tech company. Double the security budgets, break up sensitive into different databases, stop issuing unrandomized backup passwords. Clamp down with hardcore firewalls and physical security. Always update to the latest operating system security patches. Let us two-factor everything. Train customer service reps to spot social engineering hacks, and make sure every employee knows how avoid phishing attacks.\nMeanwhile, software makers like Microsoft need to step up and take more responsibility for protecting older versions of their operating systems. And governments need to more aggressively punish companies with weak security such that it’s too expensive to risk. The US failed to approve a 2015 bill proposed by Obama that would require public disclosures of breaches within 30 days, with penalties for keeping people in the dark. While some states have adopted their own disclosure rules, they’re a haphazard patchwork.\nEurope has set a good example with its new laws coming into effect in 2018 that levy stiff fines against companies that don’t disclose a data breach within 72 hours (with some exceptions). Violators can get slapped with a penalty of up to 2% of their global annual revenue, which would of stuck Equifax with over $60 million in fines.\nUnfortuantely, not all these changes are going to happen. So the future will require people and governments to make a new type of judgement call: How secure must a company’s technology systems be such that the benefit of giving it access to information or infrastructure outweighs the risk of havoc caused by a potential breach.\nMost people won’t have the knowledge or interest to be able to accurately make this call. Most governments will be too slow-moving or penny-pinching to effectively make this call. The companies will knowingly downplay the risk to boost their businesses. And the hackers will laugh all the way to the bank, whether they want to steal everything inside or just burn it down.\n0\nSHARES",

      "text": "Mexico City’s Earthquake Alert Worked. The Rest of the Country Wasn’t So Lucky   MEXICO CITY—”Alerta sísmica! Alerta sísmica!” Few things strike as much fear into the hearts of Mexico City residents as the words “seismic alert” blaring from speakers in schools and parks. It means an earthquake is rumbling up from the Pacific coast, and you have 60 to 90 seconds to get someplace safe. I had just turned out the light to go to sleep when the alarm went off last night at almost midnight. My husband and I heard it from the elementary school next to our apartment building. We both grew up with earthquakes—him in Mexico City, me in Los Angeles—but we still spent the first 10 seconds in disbelief. A false earthquake alarm had gone off the day before, due to human error during maintenance of the system. The few other times I had heard the alarm, the resulting shaking had barely registered in my building. Couldn’t we ignore it and go to sleep? No. Mexico City is one of the few lucky places to have a public earthquake warning system at all. It was the first system of its kind in the world, up and running just six years after the 1985 earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in the capital. Mexico City has a built-in geological advantage when it comes to early warning: The subduction zones that produce the quakes are along the Pacific coast, more than 200 miles away from the city. While seismic waves normally would peter out over that distance, here they are amplified by the pile of mud upon which Mexico City is built, the remnants of a large lake drained during the colonial period. That can make for some particularly deadly earthquakes. But it also gives us time to learn that one is on the way. I scooped up my dog and ran to get under the dining room table, my husband right behind me. Many people in Mexico City run out of their buildings when they hear the seismic alarm, an instinct honed by the memories of pancaking hospitals and tumbling apartment towers in 1985. We’re on the third floor, though, and I didn’t think we could get to the courtyard within the 1-minute warning window—especially not with a cat and a dog. Plus, everything about my California earthquake training told me to get underneath something and stay put; my building might fall, but so might trees and power lines outside. From our spot under the table, we could hear some of our neighbors in the hallway. They were laughing sheepishly, seemingly a bit embarrassed to be so frightened by an alarm and unsure whether evacuating was really necessary. We were under the table long enough for me, too, to wonder if it might be another false alarm. But then the ground started rolling beneath us. That’s when our neighbors started running. The seismic alarm doesn’t tell you anything about intensity, so there was no way to know how strong the quake would get. It turned out to be the largest earthquake recorded in Mexico in a century, clocking in at 8.1 magnitude at the epicenter 54 miles off the Chiapas coast. In Mexico City it lasted a full minute, the floor heaving, the building creaking, furniture rattling. I focused on every breath, just trying to get to the next one. But nothing fell in our apartment—much less the building itself—and our electricity stayed on. As soon as I was sure it was over and my dizziness passed (earthquakes in Mexico City can feel like being on a boat because of our Jello-like ground), I opened Twitter to see how the rest of the city had fared. My feed had erupted with videos of everything from lampposts to the giant Angel of Independence monument swaying feverishly. People filmed transformers exploding, sending sparks flying and leaving many neighborhoods without power. The city’s emergency services jumped into action, pushing out data about the quake and fanning out to check for damage while warning of aftershocks. It was quickly apparent there had been only minimal damage in Mexico City. A few factors spared us from a repeat of 1985. The epicenter was farther from the city this time, and it occurred deeper in the crust. Building codes have been updated and stringently enforced since 1985, when many shoddy structures—some authorized through corrupt government contracts—collapsed into rubble. Since there was no widespread destruction, the early-warning alarm likely didn’t save any lives this time, but it worked just as it was meant to. Mexico City residents are relieved. Sure, we got lucky geologically, but we also benefited from measures implemented to protect the capital, which withstood their strongest test yet. More Quake Science Experts Answer Your Biggest Questions About Earthquakes \nChelsea Leu Why It’s So Darn Hard to Build a Fast Quake Warning System \nNick Stockton Earthquakes Don’t Kill People, Buildings Do In southern Mexico, however, it is a different story. There have been more than 30 deaths reported so far, and many buildings collapsed or were seriously damaged in Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco. Part of the city hall in Juchitán, Oaxaca, seemingly disintegrated , with a Mexican flag standing amidst the rubble. Rescue efforts are ongoing. Large swaths of these states are rural and isolated, and it will likely take several days to understand the true extent of the devastation. The sensors for the early-warning system run up and down the Pacific coast, and some of the cities there, such as Acapulco, have an early-warning system (though residents there necessarily have a shorter window to get to safety, because they are closer to where the quakes originate). These coastal areas help protect us from earthquake damage in Mexico City, but due to poverty and isolation they are some of the least protected. Mexico is a very centralized country, with political, cultural, and economic life revolving around Mexico City. The trauma of the devastated capital in 1985 is seared into the country’s psyche, and for good reason. People who remember it say it looked like the city had been bombed; you could smell the dead bodies for days. But in its wake, the city and country stepped up to do everything they could to prevent another disaster of that scale here. So far, it’s worked. But the devastation in the south makes it clear that communities that are even more at risk haven’t received the same protection. They don’t have building codes nor the inspectors to enforce them. They don’t have early-warning alarms. Many don’t even have reliable roads by which help can arrive. For too long, Mexico City has been the only place on people’s minds when it comes to earthquake preparedness and protection. Perhaps this is the quake that will finally change that. TAGS",

      "text": "03:50 pm Mexico City’s Earthquake Alert Worked. The Rest of the Country Wasn’t So Lucky Residents stand on debris of a partially collapsed building felled by a massive earthquake in Juchitan, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Friday, Sept. 8, 2017. Luis Alberto Cruz/AP MEXICO CITY—\"Alerta sísmica! Alerta sísmica!\" Few things strike as much fear into the hearts of Mexico City residents as the words “seismic alert” blaring from speakers in schools and parks. It means an earthquake is rumbling up from the Pacific coast, and you have 60 to 90 seconds to get someplace safe. I had just turned out the light to go to sleep when the alarm went off last night at almost midnight. My husband and I heard it from the elementary school next to our apartment building. We both grew up with earthquakes—him in Mexico City, me in Los Angeles—but we still spent the first 10 seconds in disbelief. A false earthquake alarm had gone off the day before, due to human error during maintenance of the system. The few other times I had heard the alarm, the resulting shaking had barely registered in my building. Couldn’t we ignore it and go to sleep? No. Mexico City is one of the few lucky places to have a public earthquake warning system at all. It was the first system of its kind in the world, up and running just six years after the 1985 earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in the capital. Mexico City has a built-in geological advantage when it comes to early warning: The subduction zones that produce the quakes are along the Pacific coast, more than 200 miles away from the city. While seismic waves normally would peter out over that distance, here they are amplified by the pile of mud upon which Mexico City is built, the remnants of a large lake drained during the colonial period. That can make for some particularly deadly earthquakes. But it also gives us time to learn that one is on the way. I scooped up my dog and ran to get under the dining room table, my husband right behind me. Many people in Mexico City run out of their buildings when they hear the seismic alarm, an instinct honed by the memories of pancaking hospitals and tumbling apartment towers in 1985. We’re on the third floor, though, and I didn’t think we could get to the courtyard within the 1-minute warning window—especially not with a cat and a dog. Plus, everything about my California earthquake training told me to get underneath something and stay put; my building might fall, but so might trees and power lines outside. From our spot under the table, we could hear some of our neighbors in the hallway. They were laughing sheepishly, seemingly a bit embarrassed to be so frightened by an alarm and unsure whether evacuating was really necessary. We were under the table long enough for me, too, to wonder if it might be another false alarm. But then the ground started rolling beneath us. That’s when our neighbors started running. The seismic alarm doesn’t tell you anything about intensity, so there was no way to know how strong the quake would get. It turned out to be the largest earthquake recorded in Mexico in a century, clocking in at 8.1 magnitude at the epicenter 54 miles off the Chiapas coast. In Mexico City it lasted a full minute, the floor heaving, the building creaking, furniture rattling. I focused on every breath, just trying to get to the next one. But nothing fell in our apartment—much less the building itself—and our electricity stayed on. As soon as I was sure it was over and my dizziness passed (earthquakes in Mexico City can feel like being on a boat because of our Jello-like ground), I opened Twitter to see how the rest of the city had fared. My feed had erupted with videos of everything from lampposts to the giant Angel of Independence monument swaying feverishly. People filmed transformers exploding, sending sparks flying and leaving many neighborhoods without power. The city’s emergency services jumped into action, pushing out data about the quake and fanning out to check for damage while warning of aftershocks. It was quickly apparent there had been only minimal damage in Mexico City. A few factors spared us from a repeat of 1985. The epicenter was farther from the city this time, and it occurred deeper in the crust. Building codes have been updated and stringently enforced since 1985, when many shoddy structures—some authorized through corrupt government contracts—collapsed into rubble. Since there was no widespread destruction, the early-warning alarm likely didn’t save any lives this time, but it worked just as it was meant to. Mexico City residents are relieved. Sure, we got lucky geologically, but we also benefited from measures implemented to protect the capital, which withstood their strongest test yet. More Quake Science",

      "text": "Equifax, which yesterday announced a truly enormous breach , will not require affected consumers to forfeit their right to join a class action lawsuit against the company in order to receive credit protection. The company clarified the forced arbitration clause in its terms of service after outcry by consumer advocates, including New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who called the requirement “unacceptable and unenforceable.”\nThe company added the following to its FAQ for the TrustedID Premier program it is offering to those affected by the breach:\nDo the TrustedID Terms of Use limit my options related to the cyber security incident?\nThe arbitration clause and class action wavier [sic] included in the TrustedID Premier Terms of Use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident.\nIn other words, if you use the service, any dispute regarding the service itself (e.g. the protections fail to work) would be forced into arbitration — but legal action relating specifically to the breach is not affected. I’ve contacted Equifax for more specifics, but their press office is likely being bombarded right now so it may be a while before they respond.\nIf you want to be extra sure you won’t be bound by the arbitration clause, you can opt out by writing a snail mail letter to the company:\nTimely written notice of opt out must be delivered to Equifax Consumer Services LLC, Attn.: Arbitration Opt-Out, P.O. Box 105496, Atlanta, GA 30348 , and must include Your name, address, and Equifax User ID, as well as a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Equifax through arbitration.\nDon’t worry, you don’t get put on some kind of list. “Opting out of the arbitration provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Equifax or the delivery of Products to You by Equifax.”\nNote: I am not a lawyer or financial advisor. Equifax may change these terms or interpret them differently (which is why I asked for more information). If you are at all unsure about this, wait and see and take actions of your own, such as notifying your bank, getting a free credit report and watching for suspicious transactions.\nIn the meantime, you may not even be missing out on much: a recent GAO investigation of these kinds of services found that “companies often offer consumers affected by a data breach complimentary identity theft services for reasons other than mitigating the risk of identity theft, such as avoiding liability or complying with state law.” And last week several members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce asked for a closer look at “whether private-sector and government entities have converged on suboptimal solutions for providing protection for consumers and whether better solutions ought to be pursued.”\nThe terms read in part:\nBy consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed.\nSuch forced arbitration clauses are common in service agreements, and have been held up repeatedly in court.\nInstead of using the court system, consumers would have to take complaints or damages through an arbitration system under terms dictated by the company. Arbitration agreements may limit consumers’ ability to appeal, under what jurisdiction negotiations would take place, whether the process is public or secret, and so on. It’s possible that the process may be faster and simpler in some cases, but one cedes an immense amount of control to the company — which it is certain to exert for its own benefit.\nThere was no indication in the terms of service that this particular clause would apply only to certain disputes, and people naturally perceived it as an opportunistic attempt by the company to inoculate itself against legal action.\nFeatured Image: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic ",

      "text": "Zello tops US app store as the walkie-talkie for hurricane volunteers Posted Tesla flips a switch to increase the range of some cars in Florida to help people evacuate With Hurricane Irma hitting Florida’s southern islands as a category four storm, and more than 6.3 million being told to evacuate Florida, being able to stay in contact with the outside world is a high priority. As a result, smartphone apps which can help coordinate rescues and responses have become crucial to efforts. \nThe main one that’s being talked about — and downloaded at a prodigious rate — is Zello , a walkie-talkie app which was originally launched in Russia in 2007 under the name LoudTalks (but since moved to Austin, Texas in 2011) and now boasts 100 million users around the world. After being featured in a Houston Chronicle story about the “Cajun Navy” of volunteers who have been using the app to coordinate their efforts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, the app hit the top of the US app store. \nZello appears to have added six million new registered users since Monday, the company’s CEO, Bill Moore, told BuzzFeed News , and is now the top free app on the iOS App Store. “With the crush of new users and emergency situations, most of the Zello team is working long days either maintaining capacity or helping with customer support,” he said. \nHowever, the huge interest in Zello saw the company admitting it has had to add servers to keep it up. \nNow, with Hurricane Irma bearing down on Florida, interest in Zello is being boosted yet again. \nThere’s absolutely no doubt that using a walkie-talkie app works extremely well in tough situations, and especially amongst volunteers who are quite simply too busy helping people to try typing on a smart phone. Especially when, let’s face it, their hands are wet and the weather is so bad. \nHowever, for some reason social media is rife with incorrect assertions that the app will still work even without a cell signal, perhaps because it is being used in this disaster context. \nTo his credit, Founder and CEO/CTO Alexey Gavrilov has made it expressly clear on their blog that Zello “is not intended as a replacement for instructions from government emergency agencies or sanctioned rescue organizations. It is not a hurricane rescue tool and is only as useful as the people who use it, and as reliable as the data network available. If there is no WiFi and no cellular data service, communication apps (including Zello) won’t work.” \nAside from that, Zello is clearly benefiting from the attention because of the sudden interest in apps which may help rescuers and volunteers. \n“We have seen a large number of people signing up for Zello in preparation for Hurricane Irma. Over 1 million people have joined in the last day, with most coming from Puerto Rico and Florida,” wrote Gavrilov. \nZello’s success may not just be down to what’s happening right now. The app is available for a wide number of platforms, including iOS, Android and BlackBerry, but crucially also Windows Phone 8, Windows PCs, and LMRs (Land Mobile Radio). \nIt allows anywhere from two to 1,000 users to have instant, live conversations. Users can talk one-on-one, start a channel (like a group) or join one of thousands of existing public channels. This too is probably why it has taken off: like Slack, it has public channels which anyone can join. \nThe app is available in more than 20 languages. Zello also has Zello@Work for companies needing a secure private network and looking to replace two-way radio. It has a web-based console and works with Windows rugged devices. The service is free for up to five users. \nBut another startup may also benefit from this interest in Walkie-talkie apps. Voxer in SF was built by Tom Katis , Matt Ranney in 2007 and the company has raised $30M so far. More aimed at the enterprise, the original idea for Voxer came to Katis when he was deployed int he special forces in Afghanistan. \nMeanwhile, interesting apps which work without cellular or Wifi access may well be set to surge as well. \nUS startup Bridgefy has a user-friendly app for messaging using only Bluetooth and Wifi, while Jott has long been a staple of teenagers in High Schools when phone signals or wifi are often blocked. 0",

Brian Blanco/Stringer/Getty Images \nAt 80 miles wide, with 155 mile per hour winds, Hurricane Irma is terrifying in its perfection , with warm, deep water and minimal wind shear helping it along. And after it devastated Caribbean islands, Irma is making its way straight toward Florida. \nUnlike during Hurricane Harvey, where most local officials ordered their residents to shelter in place , the message with Irma has been, run . “If you’re in a evacuation zone, you’ve got to get out,” Florida Governor Rick Scott said on Good Morning America Friday morning. “You can’t wait.” \nAnd so, with plenty of warning, as many as 6 million people could book it out of the state’s three most populous counties, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, ahead of Saturday’s landfall. That, added to exoduses from the Florida Keys and surrounding towns, would make this the largest mass evacuation in American history, beating 2005’s Houston-area Hurricane Rita exit by millions . Residents aren’t the only ones fleeing: Airlines are moving their aircraft out of the region, along with as many passengers as they can carry. Ships are skipping stops in Florida, or rearranging schedules to come back when Irma has dissipated. \nIt’s hard to put the scale of this mass migration into words, which is why we’re letting maps do the talking. Use the slider tool to view road, air, and marine traffic a week ago (on the left) and then in the midst of Friday’s exodus (on the right). Google Maps \nAccording to live traffic data from Google Maps, road-going evacuees had mostly cleared out of Southern Florida by late Friday afternoon, with heavy traffic jams cropping up in the middle of the state instead. I-75, to the south of Ocala, got the worst of it, where the main road meets the Florida Turnpike, stuffed with the cars coming out of Orlando. Areas to the north weren’t much better, as traffic clogged the roads up all the way up through Tallahassee, Florida, and Atlanta. Don’t forget about other states, too—traffic was predictably messy around Savannah, Georgia, under mandatory evacuation orders, and inland South Carolina. The red runs as far north as Atlanta. \nFor authorities, facilitating car evacuations are a question of logistics . Most main roads go to contraflow, with both sides of the highway pointing north, away from Irma. Officials set up fuel stations along the highway, and rapid response tow teams gear up to get damaged vehicles off the road ASAP. FlightRadar24 \nOthers have fled the peninsula by airplane. The Federal Aviation Administration said Miami’s traffic controllers handled 11,500 flights on Thursday, compared to 8,800 a week earlier. Live air traffic images Friday afternoon from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24 show an abundance of commercial airliners and private planes getting out of the area. Most Floridian airports began suspending flights Friday afternoon, and will completely close up shop at some point Saturday as Irma arrives. MarineTraffic \nSome of the upper crust also appear to be moving their yachts out of the eastern Florida coast. (Those are the pink dots.) Friday saw a conspicuous lack of container ships in the area (green), as well as passenger ships (blue). “Usually, that area is full of ships,” says Nerijus Poskus, the head of ocean freight for the customs brokerage company Flexport. Not this weekend. MarineTraffic \nWhere did the ships go? A wider view of the area shows a veritable flotilla making its way around the state’s tip and skirting by Cuba before heading west, into the Gulf. The stronger winds, in pinks, reds, and oranges, nip at their floating heels. \nIn an all-caps message tweeted Friday night , the National Weather Center outpost in Key West reminded residents that “THIS IS AS REAL AS IT GETS,” and that they still have time to leave. Because getting stuck in traffic is better than getting stuck in the middle of an historic hurricane. ",

      "text": "And now the names of Apple’s new iPhones look to have leaked… By link to original article \nWe are but days away from the event of the Apple calendar year when the company pulls the curtain up on new iPhone models. And yet the leaks keep coming. \nThe latest juicy tidbit is what looks to be the official names of the three models Apple is rumored to be announcing next Tuesday — and they suggest Cupertino is skipping its usual ‘S’ generation convention for this release, as well as throwing in a curve ball christening for the most expensive model of the trio. \nThe top-of-the-range iPhone, which is expected to ditch the home button to make way for more screen real-estate, replacing the fingerprint-powered Touch ID with a facial recognition alternative, has been referred to as ‘D22’ in a leaked iOS 11 firmware build. \nBut according to a developer who’s being sifting through the firmware the official name will be the iPhone X. \nWhich is at least not iPhone Ferrari, as was another of its rumored codenames. \nWhile the other two iPhone models are set to be named the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus , according to the leak, meaning Apple is eschewing an iterative iPhone 7s/7s Plus release — underlining how the company wants this release to be interpreted; i.e. not at all iterative. \nAt this point you do have to wonder whether Apple is retiring the iPhone ‘s’ cycle for good — something TC’s Editor in Chief Matthew Panzarino was calling for back in 2015 at the time of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. \nAfter all, when you’re asking people to shell out as much as $1,000 or more for their next smartphone — as has been the rumored price-tag for the incoming iPhone X — there’s rather a lot of perceived value resting on a name. \nFeatured Image: TIMOTHY A.

      "text": "We are but days away from the event of the Apple calendar year when the company pulls the curtain up on new iPhone models. And yet the leaks keep coming.\nThe latest juicy tidbit is what looks to be the official names of the three models Apple is rumored to be announcing next Tuesday — and they suggest Cupertino is skipping its usual ‘S’ generation convention for this release, as well as throwing in a curve ball christening for the most expensive model of the trio.\nThe top-of-the-range iPhone, which is expected to ditch the home button to make way for more screen real-estate, replacing the fingerprint-powered Touch ID with a facial recognition alternative, has been referred to as ‘D22’ in a leaked iOS 11 firmware build.\nBut according to a developer who’s being sifting through the firmware the official name will be the iPhone X.\nWhich is at least not iPhone Ferrari, as was another of its rumored codenames.\nWhile the other two iPhone models are set to be named the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus , according to the leak, meaning Apple is eschewing an iterative iPhone 7s/7s Plus release — underlining how the company wants this release to be interpreted; i.e. not at all iterative.\niPhone 8\niPhone 8 Plus\niPhone X pic.twitter.com/OVLfhLxTdT\n— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 9, 2017\nAt this point you do have to wonder whether Apple is retiring the iPhone ‘s’ cycle for good — something TC’s Editor in Chief Matthew Panzarino was calling for back in 2015 at the time of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.\nAfter all, when you’re asking people to shell out as much as $1,000 or more for their next smartphone — as has been the rumored price-tag for the incoming iPhone X — there’s rather a lot of perceived value resting on a name.\nFeatured Image: TIMOTHY A.

      "text": "Advertisement Someone across the room throws you a ball and you catch it. Simple, right? Actually, this is one of the most complex processes we’ve ever attempted to comprehend – let alone recreate. Inventing a machine that sees like we do is a deceptively difficult task, not just because it’s hard to make computers do it, but because we’re not entirely sure how we do it in the first place.\nWhat actually happens is roughly this: the image of the ball passes through your eye and strikes your retina, which does some elementary analysis and sends it along to the brain, where the visual cortex more thoroughly analyzes the image. It then sends it out to the rest of the cortex, which compares it to everything it already knows, classifies the objects and dimensions, and finally decides on something to do: raise your hand and catch the ball (having predicted its path). This takes place in a tiny fraction of a second, with almost no conscious effort, and almost never fails. So recreating human vision isn’t just a hard problem, it’s a set of them, each of which relies on the other. \nWell, no one ever said this would be easy. Except, perhaps, AI pioneer Marvin Minsky, who famously instructed a graduate student in 1966 to “connect a camera to a computer and have it describe what it sees.” Pity the kid: 50 years later, we’re still working on it. \nSerious research began in the 50s and started along three distinct lines: replicating the eye (difficult); replicating the visual cortex (very difficult); and replicating the rest of the brain (arguably the most difficult problem ever attempted). To see \nReinventing the eye is the area where we’ve had the most success. Over the past few decades, we have created sensors and image processors that match and in some ways exceed the human eye’s capabilities. With larger, more optically perfect lenses and semiconductor subpixels fabricated at nanometer scales, the precision and sensitivity of modern cameras is nothing short of incredible. Cameras can also record thousands of images per second and detect distances with great precision. An image sensor one might find in a digital camera. \n\nYet despite the high fidelity of their outputs, these devices are in many ways no better than a pinhole camera from the 19th century: They merely record the distribution of photons coming in a given direction. The best camera sensor ever made couldn’t recognize a ball — much less be able to catch it. \nThe hardware, in other words, is severely limited without the software — which, it turns out, is by far the greater problem to solve. But modern camera technology does provide a rich and flexible platform on which to work. To describe \nThis isn’t the place for a complete course on visual neuroanatomy, but suffice it to say that our brains are built from the ground up with seeing in mind, so to speak. More of the brain is dedicated to vision than any other task, and that specialization goes all the way down to the cells themselves. Billions of them work together to extract patterns from the noisy, disorganized signal from the retina. \nSets of neurons excite one another if there’s contrast along a line at a certain angle, say, or rapid motion in a certain direction. Higher-level networks aggregate these patterns into meta-patterns: a circle, moving upwards. Another network chimes in: the circle is white, with red lines. Another: it is growing in size. A picture begins to emerge from these crude but complementary descriptions. A “histogram of oriented gradients,” finding edges and other features using a technique like that found in the brain’s visual areas. \n\nEarly research into computer vision, considering these networks as being unfathomably complex, took a different approach: “top-down” reasoning — a book looks like /this/, so watch for /this/ pattern, unless it’s on its side, in which case it looks more like /this/. A car looks like /this/ and moves like /this/. We can barely come up with a working definition of how our minds work, much less how to simulate it. \nFor a few objects in controlled situations, this worked well, but imagine trying to describe every object around you, from every angle, with variations for lighting and motion and a hundred other things. It became clear that to achieve even toddler-like levels of recognition would require impractically large sets of data. \nA “bottom-up” approach mimicking what is found in the brain is more promising. A computer can apply a series of transformations to an image and discover edges, the objects they imply, perspective and movement when presented with multiple pictures, and so on. The processes involve a great deal of math and statistics, but they amount to the computer trying to match the shapes it sees with shapes it has been trained to recognize — trained on other images, the way our brains were. \nWhat an image like this one above (from Purdue University’s E-lab ) is showing is the computer displaying that, by its calculations, the objects highlighted look and act like other examples of that object, to a certain level of statistical certainty. \nProponents of bottom-up architecture might have said “I told you so.” Except that until recent years, the creation and operation of artificial neural networks was impractical because of the immense amount of computation they require. Advances in parallel computing have eroded those barriers, and the last few years have seen an explosion of research into and using systems that imitate — still very approximately — the ones in our brain. The process of pattern recognition has been sped up by orders of magnitude, and we’re making more progress every day. To understand \nOf course, you could build a system that recognizes every variety of apple, from every angle, in any situation, at rest or in motion, with bites taken out of it, anything — and it wouldn’t be able to recognize an orange. For that matter, it couldn’t even tell you what an apple is, whether it’s edible, how big it is or what they’re used for. \nThe problem is that even good hardware and software aren’t much use without an operating system. \n\nFor us, that’s the rest of our minds: short and long term memory, input from our other senses, attention and cognition, a billion lessons learned from a trillion interactions with the world, written with methods we barely understand to a network of interconnected neurons more complex than anything we’ve ever encountered. The future of computer vision is in integrating the powerful but specific systems we’ve created with broader ones. \nThis is where the frontiers of computer science and more general artificial intelligence converge — and where we’re currently spinning our wheels. Between computer scientists, engineers, psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers, we can barely come up with a working definition of how our minds work, much less how to simulate it. \nThat doesn’t mean we’re at a dead end. The future of computer vision is in integrating the powerful but specific systems we’ve created with broader ones that are focused on concepts that are a bit harder to pin down: context, attention, intention. \nThat said, computer vision even in its nascent stage is still incredibly useful. It’s in our cameras, recognizing faces and smiles. It’s in self-driving cars, reading traffic signs and watching for pedestrians. It’s in factory robots, monitoring for problems and navigating around human co-workers. There’s still a long way to go before they see like we do — if it’s even possible — but considering the scale of the task at hand, it’s amazing that they see at all. Featured Image: Bryce Durbin",

      "text": "iPhone X may pack a 6-core processor There may even be hints at USB-C support. Save Engadget \nThis weekend's huge iOS 11 leak continues to spill the beans on the iPhone X ... and the latest tidbits may be particularly relevant to performance junkies. Twitter user Longhorn has found that the processor in the iPhone X, and likely the step-down iPhone 8 models, will be a six-core chip. It's not clear how many of these will be higher-powered cores versus energy-saving secondary cores (Longhorn suspects only two are high-speed cores), but it looks as if they might all be usable at the same time. That would be a big step up from the A10 Fusion in the iPhone 7, which only allows the high- or low-speed cores to run at any given moment. \nNotably, Apple has never made an iPhone where more than two cores were active at the same time. That hasn't been necessary for good performance in most circumstances (Apple's chips have regularly gone toe-to-toe with the latest from Qualcomm ), but it has hurt the iPhone's potential in multi-threaded tasks where more cores could help. Even the A10X in the current iPad Pro sticks to three full-speed cores and three efficient cores. \nAs it is, the latest code investigations allude to more than just a CPU update. There's more than one reference to USB-C, to begin with. This doesn't necessarily mean that the iPhone X will have a native USB-C connector, but it may take advantage of the format in a way the iPhone 7 can't. Other tidbits? There are further nods to wireless charging , although the absence of animations hints that it might not be available right away. And the previously mentioned Portrait Lighting feature, which changes the perception of how a subject was lit, may be available for both the iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus. We'll only know the full scoop on September 12th , but these are at least tantalizing clues. cpu0/cpu1/cpu2/cpu3/cpu4/cpu5",

One of those shows is Flash Forward , hosted by science journalist Rose Eveleth. \n“Sci-fi is so powerful in getting us to imagine things, and imagine futures,” Eveleth says in Episode 272 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “It puts you into these worlds and makes you think, ‘What would I do in that situation?'” Podcast Download \nAnother highly-produced show is Imaginary Worlds , created by Eric Molinsky, whose long career in public radio includes work for Morning Edition and All Things Considered . He was drawn to podcasting in part because of the freedom to go deep on his favorite geeky topics. \n“That was the first thing I remember noticing with Roman Mars and 99% Invisible , which was one of the first big podcasts, was that it sounded like public radio, but he could make it as long as he wanted, which was so liberating for a public radio producer,” Molinsky says. \nSci-fi fans are also being treated to professionally-produced audio dramas like Steal the Stars , Limetown , and The Message . But is all this content going to draw listeners away from the fans-and-writers talk shows that have traditionally dominated sci-fi podcasting? \n“I feel like ever since Serial came out there’s been this whole influx of really highly produced, high-quality podcasts,” says Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley. “And I just wonder, what is the future for podcasts like mine?” \nBut Rose Eveleth feels that many people—particularly those who work in radio—tend to overestimate the importance of high production values. \n“I think that there is this thing in public radio where they want the most pristine sound, which makes sense if you have a big budget and you have studios and you can do that,” she says. “But I also sometimes feel like it’s more important to have a good show, and sometimes I think there’s a little bit of fetishizing nice microphones.” \nListen to the complete interview with Rose Eveleth and Eric Molinsky in Episode 272 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below. \nEric Molinsky on public radio: \n“The people listening to the show very often would not be very well versed in [science fiction], and I felt like I often had to keep justifying why we were talking about this on public radio. And I always found with other public radio shows, or like NPR, when they would cover this stuff, they absolutely had to mention how much money these movies were making, or how many viewers this TV show had, just to justify why they were talking about it, and I remember that frustrated me a lot. … I also felt like public radio rarely talked about the issues within science fiction and fantasy, and the really interesting, in-depth conversations that the fans were having about this kind of stuff.” Related Stories Valerian Would Make a Great Silent Movie \nRose Eveleth on interviewing scientists: \n“There are some scientists who don’t want to do future stuff, which I totally understand. Some of them have had their work misrepresented in the past. … As a scientist it’s always really risky when you start talking about hypotheticals, because your job is not to talk about hypotheticals, your job is to talk about what you know and what you can test and what you can measure, and so I do try to be very careful and very clear, and try to separate the scientists from the zany, future-y stuff as much as possible. Because it’s a lose-lose situation if I make them look like they’re predicting something that they’re not, and then they get mad and then other scientists don’t want to talk to me, so I’m pretty careful about that stuff.” \nRose Eveleth on her episode “The Carbon Gene” : \n“I did this episode, and it went out, and I got a text message a couple days later that said, ‘Hey, they just talked about you on the Rush Limbaugh show.’ Apparently Rush Limbaugh thought that I was literally proposing this. He saw the headline, and went on this whole rant about how liberals are trying to genetically engineer our babies to combat climate change. It was this whole thing, and he went on this whole rant about it on his show, and I was like, ‘Oh wow, this is really bad.’ And it was actually really interesting, because I was waiting to be inundated with Rush Limbaugh listeners—to my email, or to Twitter or whatever—and I got nothing. Not a single person got in touch with me.” \nEric Molinsky on his episode “When Cthulhu Calls” : \n“I did an episode with Here Be Monsters , we did a collaboration, which was set in the world of H.P. Lovecraft. It was basically a fake episode, which starts out realistic—in fact, we did interview, I think, some kind of scientist, but eventually it got so ludicrous that I was interviewing H.P. Lovecraft’s brain in a jar, and it was making anti-Semitic comments toward me. And I could not have been more clear in the beginning that ‘This is going to start out real, but it is a radio drama.’ In the description on social media, in the description on your phone, it says ‘This is a radio drama.’ And I could not believe how many people wrote me and said, ‘I completely forgot. It was so believable that I forgot, and I’m really angry at you for misleading me.'” ",

Share Save Laptop computers sit on display in a Best Buy store in East Palo Alto, California, U.S., on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2011. Bloomberg via Getty Images \nAmid growing concern/speculation/hysteria that Kaspersky Lab products could be tied to the Russian government , retailer Best Buy has stopped selling its antivirus. Minnesota's StarTribune first reported the move, citing a source who said that the company felt there are \"too many unanswered questions\" after conducting its own investigation. There's no word on what those questions are, or why Kaspersky's offer to share its source code isn't enough to prove there's no backdoor, and the company hasn't spoken about the move beyond confirming the report. In a tweet , Kaspersky noted its products are available through other retailers and said that while its relationship with Best Buy is suspended, it \"may be re-evaluated in the future.\" Our statement in regards to the status of our business relationship with Best Buy. pic.twitter.com/4tcPoIu3Li",

      "text": "You wake up. Check your phone. Something happened overnight. People are upset. The actual news is uncertain, it’s too soon for context and understanding, but it’s not too soon for everyone to quickly confirm their biases. It’s never too soon for that.\nYou shower. Get dressed. Get ready for your job. Work emails have already begin to flood into your inbox. Some automatic, some written by such early risers. What drives those people from their bed at dawn? Your phone buzzes with a notification from an app, and then another. A fitness app reminding you to work out. A Slack message from a co-worker time zones ahead of you. A news app telling you more about last night. The news is breaking. It’s always breaking.\nFacebook reminds you that your friends have birthdays. Your personal email reminds you that your car insurance is due soon, that your free trial account with that new service will expire soon, that your credit card on record with another service expires next month, that you have only a week left to review that hotel you stayed at to get away from it all. You move these emails to your Deal With It folder, which now reports 35 unread.\nYou work on your way to work. If you drive you take calls and send emails via Siri; if you take the train you tap at your phone or type on your laptop. Then you get to work and take on the rest of your life, you triage the Deal With It folder, you book that long-delayed dentist’s appointment, feeling guilty that you’re still using an old-fashioned toothbrush.\nYou don’t feel guilty about using work time. There’s no real distinction between work time and you time any more, not on weekdays. Those two times will wax and wane, parasitically intertwined, as long as you’re awake. It’s not that it’s corporate policy. It’s not that you work at a bad place. It’s just the way things are, now. You don’t think you’d want them to work differently, to be disconnected.\nThat weird pain in your gut comes back in the afternoon. You know better than to try and diagnose it online, but you do anyhow. Maybe you have indigestion. Maybe you have cancer. Cancer isn’t a death sentence any more, though, or at least, not exactly, or at least, it’s very case by case, there’s no such thing as “cancer”, there is only a fractal taxonomization of millions of individuals with cancer, which, you reassure yourself, very likely doesn’t include you.\nYou try to eat the right kind of food for lunch. It is very unclear what the right kind of food is. It seems to be more unclear with each passing day. After work, or, well, after you leave the office, you try to do the right kind of workout, but, well, yes, again. Scientists have so much data these days, more than ever before, and, it seems, so few conclusions.\nOn the way to see your friends you check your usual online news sources again, as you’ve been doing all day, of course, in breaks between bouts of work. Violence in Berkeley. A civil war in the Middle East. Catastrophe in the Caribbean. Pollution in China. Breakthrough in AI. So much happening so fast, too fast to really make any sense of it, to put it in context, to construct a coherent narrative. Sometimes it feels like someone jammed a heavy thumb on the world’s fast-forward button, and smeared the voice of the zeitgeist into high-pitched gibberish.\nYour friends are doing well, or seem to be, but they all seem a little uncertain about their jobs, their homes, their family, their future. A few seem to have too many possibilities to choose from. Most seem to be stagnating while watching possibilities slowly wither away. Those tend to be the ones with the most beautiful, enviable, carefully curated Instagram feeds.\nYou lament the political situation with your friends. Of course you do. What’s not to lament? Other people don’t understand the problems your nation, and the world as a whole, faces. They can’t grasp the nuance, the complexity; they can’t distinguish between what is and isn’t important; they confuse trivialities with disasters about to smash through our door, and vice versa. They turn their back on the future technology is bringing to us in favor of the ridiculous idealized failures of the past. They’d rather ruin themselves, and via democracy everyone else, than ever begin to question their own kindergarten mindset.\nAs you head home the pain in your gut is back. You want to watch something good, but between Netflix and YouTube and Amazon and iTunes there are far too many choices, so you end up watching a Marvel movie instead, even though you’ve already seen it. It’s reassuring. Heroes and villains. Right and wrong. Then you go to bed, put your phone down, try to sleep, give up, and pick your phone up again, as you do every night. Your late-night people are upset. Something has happened.\nFeatured Image: Mark Skipper / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE ",

      "text": "Amazon widens its retail footprint with Kohl's partnership In other odd pairings, Home Depot made a deal with Google as well. Save shutterstock \nSometimes when you're down on your luck, you have to strike a deal with the enemy. That's what Kohl's is doing by partnering up with Amazon, ostensibly its biggest online rival, to sell Amazon hardware. The department store chain plans to open 1,000-square-foot areas in ten of its locations dedicated to the devices. This \"store-in-store\" concept is called the Amazon Smart Home Experience, and will be used to sell everything from Echo speakers to Fire tablets. \nThe concept is similar to the Experience Shops that Samsung set up with Best Buy in 2013, except that was more widespread. According to Bloomberg, the partnership will help Kohl's regain some in-store sales, which has dropped a bit -- about 0.4 percent -- in recent months. Ironically, one of the reasons sales are struggling is due to customers flocking to Amazon for their shopping needs. \nSome stores have partnered with Google so that you can buy goods through Google Home voice commands and have them delivered via Google Express. Home Depot announced this partnership this week, while Walmart made the same deal a month ago. Home Depot and Walmart don't have the same declining traffic issue as Kohl's, but this deal could still help them get more sales. \nKohl's is just the latest store to sell Amazon hardware. Just last month, Amazon started selling its Echo devices in select Whole Foods locations thanks to the recent acquisition. The Kohl's rollout will be much smaller -- it's only limited to Los Angeles and Chicago areas for now.",

      "text": "Is The Dark Tower Any Good? Depends How Much You've Read But the kiddos in It don't have much time to enjoy their adolescent freedom, as they're facing a very grown-up terror in Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), a balloon-toting clown with a malleable maw featuring rows of quill-like sharp teeth and a wild (and wildly receding) hairline that even Nicolas Cage would deem a bit much. Pennywise's introduction is one of the most nightmare-fostering moments of King's career, and director Andy Muschietti ( Mama ) retains its heartbreaking brutality: One rain-soaked afternoon, a young boy named Georgie watches as his paper boat is sent down a drain. He's subsequently charmed, chomped, and abducted by Pennywise, in a literally cold open that, by modern-horror measures, is remarkably restrained while still psyche-scarring. Georgie's disappearance consumes his older brother, Bill ( Midnight Special 's Jaeden Lieberher), who turns to his friends for help—only to learn they've all been experiencing their own private terrors, whether it be in the form of a skin-littering leper, a high-speed headless corpse, or a twisted painting come to life. Muschietti stages these scenes with a patient, take-it-all-in visual sense, as well as a keen grasp of nightmare logic (in one of the kid’s visions, Pennywise twists on a meathook in the dark distance, his eyes glowing menacingly). They could run to their folks, but, rather conveniently, the adults of It are mostly total creeps, none of whom seem to care much about the alarming number of children vanishing from their town. Maybe that's just sloppy storytelling. Or maybe that bard named Will was right: Parents just don't understand. There's plenty of theorizing in It about the nature of Pennywise—and the nature of evil—but no definitive answers. The thrills of It lie in these early, almost flirting terrors, which unite both the kids (who dub themselves the Losers' Club) and the audience in the terrifying possibility of what greater horrors await. It helps, of course, that we root for these Losers, a collection of spazzes, nerds, and outcasts who are subjected to every teen trauma imaginable, from knife-wielding bullies to signature-free yearbook pages. The film's most touching moment is also its nastiest: After the group's lone teen girl, Beverly (Sophia Lillis), is doused with gallons upon gallons of sink-borne blood—a Carrie -echoing gross-out moment with little metaphorical wiggle room—the rest of the kids show up to help her mop up the mess. It makes for an admirably on-the-nose '80s-movie montage, complete with a Cure song in the background. Yet once the Losers decide to challenge Pennywise on his own turf—confronting him in a haunted house and, later, a debris-strewn underground lair— It begins to deflate. As soon as the kids begin to scatter, you realize there's simply too many of them to keep track of, much less care about—so much so, you almost wish the filmmakers had been heartless enough to thin out their ranks a bit (the cowriting credits for It include True Detective and Beasts of No Nation director Cary Fukunaga, who left the production during development). And the breezy-ish kids-on-the-loose vibe, while fun at first, soon becomes an excuse for repetitive dick jokes and way too many \"holy shit!\" punchlines. Was such behavior typical for teen boys in the late '80s? Yep. Is it a letdown when a character like Richie (played by Stranger Things ' Finn Wolfhard) begins It as \"kid who curses\" and ends as \"kid who curses a lot \"? Holy crap, yes. It 's biggest unsolved problem, though, may be its lone marquee name—Pennywise the Clown, who, save for one fun midfilm sequence, just barely retains the creepiness of that initial rain-soaked intro. Instead, Muschietti relies on now-tiring shock-schlock tropes (lullaby-like kids' music; swift, zig-zagging runs straight toward the camera) that turn Pennywise into just another movie monster, one who's ultimately unknowable. There's plenty of theorizing in It about the nature of Pennywise—and the nature of evil—but no definitive answers. That's highlighted by the film's final 15 minutes, which consist of a rapidly edited (yet still utterly rhythmless) CGI showdown in which Pennywise shifts from monster to monster, sometimes for just seconds at a time. It's a shell-game distraction, one that mistakes evasiveness for ambiguity. And it once again unites the kids and the audience, albeit this time in confusion: Just who is this clown, exactly? Maybe we're supposed to wait for the sequel to find out, but I prefer my '80s monsters to have some greater sense of purpose. Then again, as kids used to say back in those days, maybe that's just my prerogative.

      "text": "The promise of managing identity on the blockchain Posted What you missed at the GrubHub trial about 1099 independent contractors Blockchain, the secure distributed ledger technology first created to track bitcoin ownership, has taken on a number of new roles in recent years tracking anything of value from diamonds to real estate deeds to contracts. The blockchain offers the promise of a trusted record that can reduce fraud. Some industry experts say that over the coming years, it could be used to control identity information in a more secure fashion. \nAs we have seen, just last week with the massive Equifax hack , our personal information is highly vulnerable in online databases in their current form. The fact is that whenever we have to identify ourselves, we are forced to present a variety of information to prove we are who we say we are, whether that’s to register for an online service, to cross a border or even prove you are old enough to drink at a bar. \nThe argument goes that if our identity were on the blockchain, it would give us more control over this information, and with proper applications allow us to present just the minimum amount of information a given party needs to identify us. That could be your date of birth at a bar, your credit score at a bank or a unique identifier to access an online service. \nIt’s unclear if the blockchain can be that identity panacea that some have suggested, but there are a range of opinions on the matter. Yes, it’s happening \nOf the experts we contacted, only one was fully enthusiastic about blockchain as an identity tool. Jerry Cuomo, IBM Fellow and VP of blockchain technologies, sees blockchain already having a big impact as people demand more control of their identities. He says that we are constantly being asked to share personal information to access places or information or to do business with companies — and that each of these actions puts us at risk for identity theft. He believes the solution to this problem could lie on the blockchain. \n“Imagine a world where you are in direct control of your personal information; a world where you can limit and control how much information you share while retaining the ability to transact in the world. This is self-sovereign identity, and it is already here. Blockchain is the underlying technology paving the path to self-sovereign identity through decentralized networks. It ensures privacy and trust, where transactions are secure, authenticated and verifiable and endorsed by relevant, permissioned participants,” Cuomo explained. In fact , he says that he’s already seeing businesses and governments beginning to establish and use these networks to meet citizen demand and deliver the promise of self-sovereign identity. No, probably not \nIt sounds pretty good to hear Cuomo describe it, yet not everyone is enthusiastic as he is, seeing many obstacles to using the blockchain for identity purposes. Steve Wilson, an analyst at Constellation Research, who has studied the blockchain extensively has serious reservations about it as an identity management system. \n“Identity is not going to move to the blockchain in any big way (not as we know it). Blockchains were designed to solve problems quite different from identity management (IDM). We need to remember that the classic blockchain is an elaborate system that allows total strangers to nevertheless exchange real value reliably. It works without identity and without trust. So it’s simply illogical to think such a mechanism could have anything to offer identity,” Wilson explained. \nHe adds, “The public blockchains deliberately and proudly shirk third parties, but in most cases, your identity is nothing without a third party who vouches for you in some way. Blockchain is great for some things, but it’s not magic, and it just wasn’t designed for the IDM problem space.” \nEve Maler, who works at identity management firm ForgeRock, which landed an $88 million investment last week, also finds the possibility highly unlikely for a variety of practical reasons. “Identity will not move to the blockchain if this means personal data will be put on a public permissionless blockchain (distributed ledger technology in its purest form), as this is now widely considered bad practice,” she said. \nShe added, “The “distributed nodes” element of the technology is valuable for architectures where trust in a central authority is difficult or undesirable to establish, but can be challenging where it is desirable to record sensitive information because of the increased attack surface (every node has a copy of everything) and resulting increased privacy considerations.” It depends \nThen there are those who fall somewhere in the middle. They aren’t ready to write it off, but they see a lot of obstacles along the way to implementing it, or see it as a part of a broader ecosystem of identity tools, rather than a full replacement to what we have now. \nCharles Race, president of worldwide field operations at cloud identity firm Okta, which went public this year , thinks it’s possible blockchain will emerge. He envisions a similar set of use cases as Cuomo, but sees a lot of obstacles that stand in the way of using the blockchain to implement identity management broadly moving forward. \n“A trusted entity will need to establish some legal and enforceable rules and policies for how it all works, they’ll need to make it easy for the average person to use securely, and they’ll need to convince a critical mass of people and service providers to adopt and trust the ID — all while finding an economically viable business model. Some institutions are uniquely positioned to solve all of these chicken-and-egg issues at once and bring this big idea to life — first among them are our citizen-facing government agencies,” Race explained. But he adds, “The trouble with this idea is that a universal ID poses risks to privacy and hence [could] encounter significant political opposition.” \nAndre Durand, CEO at Ping Identity, an identity management firm that was sold for a reported $600 million to Vista Equity Partners last year, says it’s not likely to happen as a full replacement over the next five years, but it could begin to play a role in identity. “What is much more likely is that the things Distributed Ledger Technology is uniquely designed for, keeping accurate records in a distributed system, will become part of the identity management ecosystem and help improve aspects of it,” he says. \nIan Glazer, an identity industry expert says it really about choosing the right tool for the job, but he doesn’t necessarily see there ever being one answer that fits every identity scenario including blockchain. \n“To ask if identity will move to blockchain is not the right question. Better to ask will use cases emerge that blockchain-related technologies are uniquely qualified to solve. Likely there will be some. But just like relational databases, LDAP and object databases, no one storage/retrieval mechanism has proven to be the single “right” tool for the job,” Glazer told TechCrunch. \nLike any emerging technology, there are going to be a range of opinions on its viability. Using the blockchain as an identity management system is no different. It will probably begin to take on some role over the next five years because the promise is just so great, but how extensive that will be depends on how the industry solves some of the outstanding issues.

Save Elon Musk \nElon Musk dropped a carefully cropped look at the SpaceX suit for astronauts on his Instagram a couple of weeks ago, and came back with a more revealing picture today. Modeled in front of the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft , it gives a better idea of what we might be able to expect. It's far sleeker than what we've seen in use from NASA until now, and as Musk noted previously, it apparently actually works. \nThe flexible, padded joint areas look like they'll give wearers a good range of motion, while the boots are relatively lightweight. That's not surprising since, as TechCrunch notes, these are for use while inside the Dragon capsule or transferring to other vehicles where the environment is pressurized, not a long walk in the cold vacuum of space. There's no word on when we'll get our next pre-Mars trip fashion show, so enjoy this pic for now. A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Sep 8, 2017 at 1:04pm PDT",

      "text": "The Equifax Breach Exposes America's Identity Crisis 630904017 Getty Images \nOne of the most shocking things about Thursday's announcement of the Equifax data breach is the sheer scale of the numbers involved. Particularly the Social Security numbers. Yes, there have been plenty of large data breaches before—5 million SSNs revealed in a Kansas Department of Commerce leak in July, 80 million in the notorious 2015 Anthem health insurance breach—but with Equifax's revelation that 143 million Americans may have had their SSNs stolen (along with other sensitive personal information), security experts are pressing for a fundamental reassessment in how, and why, we identify ourselves. \nConsidered along with the data stolen from various other breaches, hacks, and leaks, \"it’s a safe assumption that everyone’s Social Security number has been compromised and their identity data has been stolen,\" says Jeremiah Grossman, the chief of security strategy at the defense and threat monitoring firm SentinelOne. \"While it may not be explicitly true, we have to operate under that assumption now.\" \nSSNs, which have been around since the 1930s, have only one intended purpose: to track US citizens' earnings and contributions to the Social Security program. (In an uncanny twist, the Social Security Administration itself sometimes uses Equifax services to help verify a person’s identity during the process of setting up a \"My Social Security\" account, an SSA spokesperson told WIRED on Friday. But the Administration doesn't share Social Security numbers with Equifax.) Other collection of SSNs is generally legal, but the Social Security Administration has no involvement in wider use of the numbers. \"The card was never intended to serve as a personal identification document,\" the Administration says on its website . \"The universality of SSN ownership has in turn led to the SSN's adoption by private industry as a unique identifier. Unfortunately, this universality has led to abuse.\" Omnipresence Issues \nProblems stem from a number of places. Your Social Security number is supposed to be kept secret, which is an increasing challenge in the digital era. And unlike other, similar secrets (like credit card numbers and passwords), SSNs are extremely difficult to change. The Social Security Administration can issue you a new one in extreme cases of identity theft or abuse. Even if you are able to alter your SSN, though, so many institutions already have your original number on file that criminals can often successfully leverage the stolen information for years. On top of all of that, the new number you receive remains tied to the old one. \n\"The SSN is used for purposes entirely unrelated to its original purpose. That almost always leads to problems,\" says Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which has been advocating for SSN usage reform for more than two decades. \"Congress needs to step up and hold hearings. We need laws that limit the collection and use of SSNs. And we need to penalize companies that collect SSNs but can’t protect [them].\" \nThe conventional wisdom about SSN security, which is actually pretty wise, is to limit how often you give your information out. Some organizations that ask for your SSN can still interact with you without it, and sometimes there are ways around providing it. (For example, some utilities like internet providers won't require your SSN if you pay them a deposit to insure your account.) But too often these measures are inconvenient or impractical, and there are still numerous situations in which it is impossible to avoid submitting your SSN, like on tax forms or background checks. Some regulatory initiatives have had success curtailing SSN distribution, like this week's Center for Medicare Services announcement that SSNs will be removed from Medicare benefits cards. But that step alone took years to implement. System Reboot \nExperts across numerous privacy and security fields agree that the solution to the over-collection and over-use of SSNs isn't one particular replacement, but a diverse array of authentications like individual codes (similar to passwords), biometrics, and even physical tokens to create more variation in the ID process. Some also argue that the government likely won't be the driving force behind the shift. \"We have a government that works at a glacial pace in the best of times,\" says Brenda Sharton, who chairs the Privacy & Cybersecurity practice at the Goodwin law firm, which has worked on data privacy breach investigations since the early 2000s. \"There will reach a point where SSN [exposure] becomes untenable. And it may push us in the direction of having companies require multi-factor authentication.

      "title": "The Equifax Breach Exposes America's Identity Crisis | WIRED",
      "text": "The Equifax Breach Exposes America's Identity Crisis Getty Images One of the most shocking things about Thursday's announcement of the Equifax data breach is the sheer scale of the numbers involved. Particularly the Social Security numbers. Yes, there have been plenty of large data breaches before—5 million SSNs revealed in a Kansas Department of Commerce leak in July, 80 million in the notorious 2015 Anthem health insurance breach—but with Equifax's revelation that 143 million Americans may have had their SSNs stolen (along with other sensitive personal information), security experts are pressing for a fundamental reassessment in how, and why, we identify ourselves. Considered along with the data stolen from various other breaches, hacks, and leaks, \"it’s a safe assumption that everyone’s Social Security number has been compromised and their identity data has been stolen,\" says Jeremiah Grossman, the chief of security strategy at the defense and threat monitoring firm SentinelOne. \"While it may not be explicitly true, we have to operate under that assumption now.\" SSNs, which have been around since the 1930s, have only one intended purpose: to track US citizens' earnings and contributions to the Social Security program. (In an uncanny twist, the Social Security Administration itself sometimes uses Equifax services to help verify a person’s identity during the process of setting up a \"My Social Security\" account, an SSA spokesperson told WIRED on Friday. But the Administration doesn't share Social Security numbers with Equifax.) Other collection of SSNs is generally legal, but the Social Security Administration has no involvement in wider use of the numbers. \"The card was never intended to serve as a personal identification document,\" the Administration says on its website . \"The universality of SSN ownership has in turn led to the SSN's adoption by private industry as a unique identifier. Unfortunately, this universality has led to abuse.\" Omnipresence Issues Problems stem from a number of places. Your Social Security number is supposed to be kept secret, which is an increasing challenge in the digital era. And unlike other, similar secrets (like credit card numbers and passwords), SSNs are extremely difficult to change. The Social Security Administration can issue you a new one in extreme cases of identity theft or abuse. Even if you are able to alter your SSN, though, so many institutions already have your original number on file that criminals can often successfully leverage the stolen information for years. On top of all of that, the new number you receive remains tied to the old one. \"The SSN is used for purposes entirely unrelated to its original purpose. That almost always leads to problems,\" says Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which has been advocating for SSN usage reform for more than two decades. \"Congress needs to step up and hold hearings. We need laws that limit the collection and use of SSNs. And we need to penalize companies that collect SSNs but can’t protect [them].\" The conventional wisdom about SSN security, which is actually pretty wise, is to limit how often you give your information out. Some organizations that ask for your SSN can still interact with you without it, and sometimes there are ways around providing it. (For example, some utilities like internet providers won't require your SSN if you pay them a deposit to insure your account.) But too often these measures are inconvenient or impractical, and there are still numerous situations in which it is impossible to avoid submitting your SSN, like on tax forms or background checks. Some regulatory initiatives have had success curtailing SSN distribution, like this week's Center for Medicare Services announcement that SSNs will be removed from Medicare benefits cards. But that step alone took years to implement. System Reboot Experts across numerous privacy and security fields agree that the solution to the over-collection and over-use of SSNs isn't one particular replacement, but a diverse array of authentications like individual codes (similar to passwords), biometrics, and even physical tokens to create more variation in the ID process. Some also argue that the government likely won't be the driving force behind the shift. \"We have a government that works at a glacial pace in the best of times,\" says Brenda Sharton, who chairs the Privacy & Cybersecurity practice at the Goodwin law firm, which has worked on data privacy breach investigations since the early 2000s. \"There will reach a point where SSN [exposure] becomes untenable. And it may push us in the direction of having companies require multi-factor authentication. Change may come from enterprise and private companies responding to the threat by requiring additional identifiers.” Health care companies, for instance, could use a different system from education, which could use a different approach than financial institutions. If credit reporting agencies like Equifax use different identifiers than SSNs, your electric company and your wireless provider could ask for those identifiers to run background checks. And if this new identifier were easy enough to change (unlike SSNs), breaches, leaks, and other unintended exposures would be less consequential. \"The whole SSN as identifier regime needs to be scrapped,\" says Eduard Goodman, global privacy officer at the identity theft protection firm CyberScout. \"As we see more and more issues with the centralization of data, different schemes for different uses—biometrics for in-person interactions/transactions, some form of advanced encryption or blockchain technologies online. The solutions are already in front of our eyes.\" Having a few identifiers to keep track of would be more complicated for consumers than the current system, but it would have numerous benefits and would still be less to manage than the tangle of usernames and passwords that exist online. \"Can I imagine a world where we don’t have this one identifier floating around?\" SentinelOne's Grossman asks. \"We have it on the web. We don’t log into Facebook or LinkedIn or Google with our social security number, so I can imagine that world. We actually live it online.\" The personal security situation on the internet as it stands now is certainly fraught, but it would be possible for organizations to implement strong and diverse authentication factors that cut down on the dramatic exposure that currently exists with SSNs. Even simply mailing customers an additional pin number has allowed the Internal Revenue Service to reduce identity theft-related tax fraud. \"It's kind of a watershed moment, but whether and what kind of changes companies implement will depend on their business model and how much of a hit they take,\" after data breaches, Goodwin's Sharton says. \"These incidents can be reputationally devastating.\" The impacts of Equifax's breach could push the company to advocate for new identifiers and authenticators in the credit reporting and financial sectors. Everyone with a Social Security number–also known as the hundreds of millions of people in the US with a Social Security number– is counting on a change.",

      "text": "Meet the tech company that wants to make you even more addicted to your phone Posted Airbnb urges housing reform in Berlin after court overturns permit rejection With a magic line of code, Dopamine Labs aims to give any app the same addictive power that Facebook, Zynga and others have spent millions to perfect. \nThe company — a product of the little-heard joke “What do you get when a neuro-psychologist and a neuro-economist walk into bar?” — is the culmination of years of research that Ramsay Brown and co-founder T. Dalton Combs conducted at the University of Southern California. \nNow, armed with $1 million in seed funding and some initial data that their experiments in mind control actually work, Dopamine Labs is spending money to boost its staff and sales and marketing efforts to bring more apps in on its brain science. \nMuch of that million in funding came from the now-defunct Lowercase Capital, which was helmed by Chris Sacca and Matt Mazzeo. Dopamine appears to be one of the firm’s last deals before both Sacca and Mazzeo became embroiled in the sexual misconduct scandals that swept the venture industry during 2017’s long, lurid summer. \nWhile Brown condemned the behavior that’s been attributed to Sacca — and expressed disappointment that Mazzeo found the same troubles at his would-be new home, Binary Capital — he said that it didn’t dissuade him from taking Lowercase’s money. \n“It’s all of our jobs in the community to make sure that those kinds of attitudes and beliefs don’t have a place in the industry going forward,” Brown told me. “It’s our job to make sure that everyone gets treated as a human, not as an object.” \nBeyond Lowercase Capital, additional investments in the round came from Social Starts, one of the most prolific early-stage investment firms; Deep Fork Capital; and First Round Capital founder Howard Morgan, through a personal investment. Morgan is also taking a seat on the Dopamine Labs board of directors. \n“I was excited to find a strong team that had deep knowledge of neuroscience, and an understanding of how to apply it in today’s world where people are so often overloaded with inputs,” said Morgan, in a statement. “I think Dopamine can become a major tool with many applications and am happy to have invested and to be helping them grow.” \nWhat attracted these investors, said Brown, are the results that Dopamine Labs has seen with the pilot customers it’s enrolled for its addiction experiment. \n“As you collect more data, things happen within the data set that improves the quality of the model, which in turn improves the quality of the service,” Brown said. \nManaging all of this data is Skinner, an artificial intelligence software named after the famous psychologist B.F. Skinner, that monitors different prompts it’s making to the customers on apps that use Dopamine Labs’ code. Skinner’s all about learning what works for improving usage on an app or getting returning customers, and it optimizes those notifications as customers continue to use the app. \nThe technology previously had a Bayesian assumption about how that strategy of reinforcement would work. “It updates its probability scenarios (beliefs) about how likely causal its past decisions were to create today’s behavior and then tweaks a parameter,” Brown explained. “At the 30-day mark, when experiments on all of our users turn over, it determines what appeared to matter and what could be changed to improve.” \nEssentially, the software now can learn how to improve user retention itself in each of the apps it’s working with. \n“It makes those optimizations on our behalf,” Brown said. “We crafted for it to learn something about the structure of how human motivation works. It is now gathering enough data on its own to make meaningful observations to change human behavior.” \nOther companies have tried to take this automated, intelligent approach to hooking people on apps. Companies like Urban Airship, Retention Sciences and Marketo come to mind for Brown — but they approach things from a marketing and advertising perspective. Brown says that may work if you’re trying to get people to simply buy things. \nUsing Dopamine Labs’ code, Brown posits that an app can increase usage across the board — not just sales. \nIf all of that sounds creepy, don’t worry… it is. \nTo offset the company’s mind games, Dopamine Labs developed a tool called Space that allows users to turn off certain notifications from apps or reduce their frequency… Although I think anyone can actually just turn off notifications on a phone to solve that problem. \nThe app was profiled in an episode of 60 Minutes. \nUltimately, Dopamine Labs predicts they can add 10 percent to a company’s revenues. In practice, their numbers are a bit all over the map, with some companies seeing bounces of more than 100 percent in terms of user interactions with, in or on an app. For other companies the boost could be around 8 percent. \nThere’s a lingering question in the back of my head about the morality of mind-gaming customers into coming back to an app or a site. Already, the industry struggles with the darker side of app and screen addiction. \nDopamine’s founders argue that they reserve the right to deny service to specific companies whose work seems to be off the level, but, as with most tech these days, that’s a lot of power to put in one person’s hands. \nThe flip side to all of that, is that if a technology like Dopamine can actually encourage retention on apps aimed at self-improvement, that’s an inarguably good thing. 0 ",

      "text": "China aims for an industry-changing ban on fossil fuel cars It's the largest country ever to demand a switch to electric vehicles. Jon Fingas, 5h ago \nIt's not just European countries planning long-term bans on fossil fuel cars . China's vice minister of industry and IT, Xin Guobin, has revealed that the country's government is developing a timetable for a ban on sales of fossil fuel vehicles. The official hasn't given a rough estimate for when a ban would kick in, but France and the UK are both aiming for 2040. It won't be surprising if China aims for a similar time frame, and it's already introducing a cap-and-trade program that forces companies to buy credits from rivals if their fuel economy and emissions don't fall within certain limits. \nThe move is as much about the economy as the environment. China is clearly grappling with severe air pollution , and taking gas-powered cars off the road could help when combined with a reduced dependence on coal power . However, a ban on those sales would also help the Chinese car market, which is quickly building a reputation for EVs through brands like Geely (which owns Volvo ) and BYD . It would encourage foreign companies to collaborate with the Chinese, too, such as Honda's just-announced plans to release a China-specific EV in 2018. And crucially, banning sales of fossil fuel cars will cut oil imports, reducing China's dependence on other countries. \nWhatever the motivations, the eventual ban is likely to have a tremendous effect on the automotive industry. Although China's ratio of car ownership is relatively low (about 1 in 5 people), the sheer number of people in the country makes it the largest car market on Earth, with about 290 million vehicles on the road as of 2016 . Automakers may have little choice but to switch to EVs if they want to operate in China and compete with the world's biggest brands. In other words, it likely won't matter what politicians elsewhere believe about the environment -- China's shift could dictate a switch to EVs around the world. ",

      "text": "The next Apple Watch will have LTE cell service Posted Last night an iOS 11 GM download link made its way onto Reddit , which 9to5Mac discovered and has been digging through. \nYou can check out the full list of discoveries here , but one big thing that stood out is that the next Apple Watch (or at least one version of it) will finally have LTE cell service, meaning it doesn’t need to be tethered to your phone at all times. The leaked screenshot above shows a LTE signal strength indicator in the top left corner of the watch. \nThe benefits of a cell connection are clear – you could stream music or take a phone call on a run without needing to keep your phone in your pocket. \nInterestingly, 9to5Mac says that your LTE Apple Watch will share the same phone number as your existing iPhone. This means that you’ll be able to take calls on either device, and that plans may be less expensive than traditional data-only devices like an iPad.Traditionally carriers assign new phone numbers to devices even if they are only being used for data, like an iPad – so this is a new arrangement for carriers. \nLastly, a leaked setup screen from 9to5Mac suggests that the new LTE watch will have a red crown, to differentiate it from the older versions. \nTwo years ago, when the original Apple Watch launched, Tim Cook was spotted in an Apple Store sporting a version with a red crown . It’s not clear if this means Cook was testing a version of the LTE watch in the wild, or the red dot meant something different at the time. \n",

      "text": "A Stanford professor’s advice on surviving the a**hole at your startup Posted Samsung is selling Note8 pre-orders faster than any Note before it If you’ve never worked for a complete jerk, consider yourself lucky. Roughly one in five people polled say they’ve experienced bullying in the workplace, according to a 2017 study commissioned by the Workplace Bullying Institute. The study — which is actually pretty fascinating — concluded that 61 percent of the time, the bully is the person to whom an employee reports directly. Bullies are also men 70 percent of the time, while 66 percent of the time it’s women who are targets of bullying. \nNone of this is news to Stanford Professor Bob Sutton, who co-founded both the d.school and Stanford Tech Ventures . He authored “ The No Asshole Rule ” a decade ago, and, relying on academic studies and thousands of email exchanges and conversations he has had with readers since, Sutton is now publishing a follow-up book next week called “ The Asshole Survival Guide .” \nWe talked with Sutton yesterday about what it means to be an asshole, how to work alongside one and why startups likely have more than their fair share of them. \nTC: You cover a lot of ground in this book, which is basically a guide to figuring out a way to survive a terrible human being based on how much power you have. Why write a second book on this particular topic? \nBS: “The No Asshole Rule” was really meant to be about building relatively jerk-free cultures, but people from all corners have been approaching me ever since, saying, “I work with a jerk. What do I do?” I sort of became the Dr. Phil for people with asshole problems. \nTC: Is this meant to mostly entertain? Is it anecdotal? \nBS: I did want it to be entertaining and readable, but I take an evidence-based perspective. I’m an organizational researcher at Stanford, so I’ve carefully reviewed thousands of economic papers on bullying and abusive workplaces. \nTC: You talk a lot about creating physical and mental distance from bullies. But I’ve interviewed one of your Stanford colleagues in the past, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who takes a very different stance. He argues that you’ve got to fight bullies or else lose to them. His thinking is that nice guys finish last . \nBS: I’ve written two books with Jeff and although he loves making that argument, he’s in the minority. My personal philosophy is that if you’re a winner and an asshole, you’re still a loser as a human being. But further, if you look at Adam Grant , who’s perhaps the most respected researcher in our field, and a host of others of us, we think if you beat people badly, you may win in the short term, but your enemies lie in wait to bring you down. \nTC: You hear that refrain a lot in startups I think — the founder who was wronged or underestimated and has an axe to grind so started his or her own company. \nBS: Sure! Look at Tony Fadell [who worked for Steve Jobs and later co-founded Nest Labs, which Google acquired for $3.2 billion ]. Getting even can be a motivation, absolutely. \nTC: You may know more about Fadell’s relationship with Jobs than I do. Maybe I should back up and ask what you mean by asshole. Is it another word for someone who’s “political” in a work setting? \nBS: The definition I use is that you’re having interactions with someone who leaves you feeling demeaned, de-energized and disrespected. It could be because they are nasty to everyone. It could be that you’re egging them on. It could also be that you’re thin-skinned. In fact, you’re right that people are often political opponents, in which case the odds that I think they are an asshole and they think I am as asshole are pretty high. But even in that situation, there are things you need to do so that your productivity and mental health don’t deteriorate. \nTC: New research suggests that it’s most often someone’s boss who they deem an asshole. Do you think that’s partly because people hate hierarchies? \nBS: If you look at research on who tends to be a workplace bully, the most frequent culprit is the person next up the hierarchy from us. The notion that people quit bosses instead of organizations is well-documented. \nThere are also studies that show when you put people in positions of power, they become more focused on their own needs than others; they become more rude. So if you’re going to pick the asshole, the most immediate culprit is someone’s immediate boss. \nTC: So you get away from that person. But to Pfeffer’s point, if you opt out, isn’t it game over? \nBS: If you’re going to work every day and someone is treating you with disrespect or you’re constantly exposed to bullying, it can lead to trouble with your family, mental health problems, sleeplessness. I think you’re a quitter and a winner if you get out of that situation. By Jeffrey’s logic, people would never divorce abusive spouses, either. \nOne thing I do emphasize is the importance of how you quit. We love the idea of the person who says, “Take this job and shove it,” but we all need our social networks. Slowly figuring out your exit options in a way that preserves those is a much better way to go about it. Unless you’re rich, like Fadell. In which case it doesn’t matter. [Laughs.] \nTC: Continuing to play devil’s advocate here, people like to think organizations care about them more than they might. Do employees sometimes mistake a focus on the bottom line for assholishness? \nBS: If you look at our biases as humans, we do overestimate how much people care about us or how important we are to others, so I think that is an issue. [With pro basketball, for example] it might lead you to label someone as an asshole if they traded you and you thought you were important. Either way, you need to change the situation. \nTC: What if you don’t have the resources to leave it? \nBS: There are a number of mind tricks that I outline in the book. One centers on temporal distance. You look for the silver lining in a situation. It’s, “Gee, that person just treated me like dirt, but when I look back on it a year from now, it won’t hurt so much.” Reframing things in such a way that they can seem funny to you helps, too. \nThere are also ways to get rid of the local asshole, but you’ll need a posse. \nTC: Before you go, do you think bullying is any worse at startups? We’ve obviously seen a lot of headlines about bad behavior this year. \nBS: If you want to talk about situations where you’re going to turn people into jerks, yes. If you put someone under a lot of time pressure, make them tired and sleep deprived, place them in a position where they feel powerful — and they felt powerless before — then potentially add physical crowding, it’s a pretty good recipe for bringing out the worst in any human being. \nIt’s frankly amazing how civilized many startups are despite the pressure they face. 0 ",

      "text": "The LG V30 is the perfect smartphone for vlogging Need a YouTube camera but also a new smartphone? The V30 gives you both. Share Save \nWhen LG took the wraps off of the LG V30 at IFA last week, it spent nearly 20 minutes of its 50-minute presentation talking about the phone's dual-camera system. Juno Cho, president of mobile communications, rattled off statistics like \"almost 80 percent of smartphone users use their smartphone at least once a week to shoot videos.\" He also said that \"we are literally on the verge of transitioning from storytelling to story-showing,\" which is almost as crazy as Samsung's new catchphrase: \"Your New Normal.\" I digress. \nCho is on to something: YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram are proof that amatuer video is massively popular . Having spotted this trend, LG is positioning the V30 as the ideal tool for anyone trying to break into making video. I decided to put LG's claim to the test and spent some time using the V30 to snap stories for Instagram and Snapchat. Plus, I took plenty of regular videos with the (amazing) built-in camera app. \nUnfortunately, the Android versions of Instagram and Snapchat are so bad that I couldn't see much of a difference between the blotchy stories that were shot on my Xperia X Compact (bad camera) and the blotchy stories shot on the V30 (good camera), so that was out. Instead, I decided to narrow my focus to the following three questions: Can you use the V30 to make YouTube videos? Is the V30 a reasonable substitute for a dedicated camera? And is the V30 the best smartphone for making video? Can you use the V30 to make YouTube videos? \nCan you use the V30 to vlog? Can you use the V30 to make YouTube videos even if you're not vlogging? Yes. This seems like a simple question, and it is: You can use almost any camera to make videos for YouTube, but unfortunately \"camera\" and \"Android phone\" are not always compatible. I got the bright idea to vlog with the HTC 10 last year because of that front-facing camera with image stabilization, but HTC's default app (at the time) allowed videos to slip below 24 frames per second (fps) in low light, and that just looks terrible. It's fine if a video is dark; it's not fine if it looks like a simulated drug trip. The V30's wide-angle lens is perfect for vlogging. Is the V30 a reasonable substitute for a dedicated camera? \nLuckily, my experience with the HTC 10 was not repeated with the V30. In fact, the V30 is the closest thing I've seen to a smartphone behaving like a real camera to date. Not only does LG give you control over the really important stuff like white balance and ISO, it also gives you control of shutter speed in video (!) and three options for bitrate (!!!). If you're someone who knows cameras and has ever tried to use one of the faux manual video apps on many smartphones, this is like being handed a cool glass of water in hell. \nAnd with a couple of exceptions, the V30's camera app does exactly what it says it's doing, and this is what I consider necessary for a smartphone to replace a dedicated camera. Not sensor or aperture size or anything like that. The camera has to do what I tell it to do, and it has to work all of the time. Then it can replace my real camera. LG's manual camera app gives almost total control over video recording. \nDespite what LG says on stage, the V30 can't match cameras with DSLR-size sensors, if we're being realistic. A tiny sensor will never produce the bokeh or sensitivity of a sensor of nearly three times the size. But LG gave us something new with the V30: LG-Cine Log. B&H has a lengthy explanation of Log (short for logarithmic) recording, but in a nutshell, this mode gives you flat, unsharpened video that's much better for editing in programs like Premiere and Final Cut. Smartphones may not have the resolving power of larger cameras, but gaining full control over the recording makes the concession far more palatable. \nI won't dwell on Log recording because it is somewhat technical, but one thing is worth noting—and it's not even clear that LG has this in mind — but for the first time, you'll be able to download and share color profiles with other people in the form of lookup tables, or LUTs. Plenty of communities exist for trading and selling LUTs for Sony and Panasonic cameras, and maybe there's a better colorist out there than the engineers at LG. I look forward to spending $15 on their V30 LUT package on Gumroad. \nSmartphones may not have the resolving power of larger cameras, but gaining full control over the recording makes the concession far more palatable. \nBut, of course, nothing's perfect, and neither is the V30. I should disclaim that we're using preproduction V30s, and the camera firmware and software isn't final. That being said, I did find a couple strange behaviors with the V30 camera. First, when you plug in an external microphone, the app doesn't automatically record with it. Instead, you have to tap on the microphone icon and set it to record from the headset mic. This is unlike any camera or smartphone I've ever used, so this behavior is a bit of a head-scratcher. Second, something is wrong with 1080p video from the wide-angle camera. Again, this is a preproduction model, but the 1080p video from the wide-angle camera looks like someone set the sharpening and noise reduction to 100 and called it a day. Is the V30 the best smartphone for making video? \nThe iPhone 7 Plus and the recently announced Galaxy Note 8 also have dual-camera systems, and both take very good video, but their telephoto lenses aren't a perfect match for what people want to create on YouTube. The tight shots that the telephoto lenses provide are great for interviews and documentary-style video, but those aren't the prevailing formats on YouTube right now. The V30's combination of wide-angle and normal lenses open up more popular YouTube formats like vlogging, extreme-sports videos, skate videos and several more. And while the upcoming iPhone announcement could change a lot, the iPhone 7 series lacks a headphone jack, making it an ordeal to charge and use an external microphone at the same time. \nOtherwise, it comes down to taste. Video taken on the iPhone, in my opinion, has best-in-class coloring. Samsung's coloring is fine but looks weird and is hard to post-process because it's already been pushed pretty far. Not only does the V30 offer Log video that allows you to choose your coloring later, I also think the colors coming out of regular video are very nice. \nSo can the V30 cut it as your primary video-making device? The answer is: absolutely yes. Thanks to its versatile dual-camera system, the V30 is capable of getting lots of different shots. The camera app itself and the manual video mode within it make the V30 worth considering by itself, and nice perks like the headphone jack and waterproofing set it above devices like the iPhone and the OnePlus 5. Samsung's \" Do What You Can't \" campaign is clearly in love with the idea of empowering content creators, but LG has actually come to the table with the tools content creators need.

      "text": "890 shares \nXiaomi, a company best known for its pocket-friendly powerhouse phones, has dipped its feet into the laptop game again, having followed up last year’s Mi Notebook Air with the Mi Notebook Pro . \nThe Mi Notebook Pro has pretty solid specs. It packs a 15.6-inch display with narrow bezels (and thankfully the webcam is tucked away on top, rather than in some bottom corner). Under the hood, you’ll find a current-gen quad-core i7, up to 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of SSD storage, and Nvidia’s new Geforce MX 150 chip. \nThe Geforce MX 150 is essentially a more powerful alternative to Intel’s integrated graphics, with Nvidia claiming its four times as capable as the last-generation Intel HD Graphics 520. So, while the Mi Notebook Pro won’t let you play Destiny 2 on full whack, it should be able to handle some CS:GO or DoTA admirably. \nPort wise, it comes with two USB-C ports, two regular USB ports, a 3-in-1 card reader, and a full-sized HDMI port. For authentication purposes, there’s a fingerprint sensor built into the wide, precision trackpad. \nAnd while looks don’t matter as much as cold, hard specs, it’s worth pointing out that the Mi Notebook Pro is an attractive piece of kit. But then again, it bears more than a passing resemblance to the MacBook Pro, wouldn’t you agree? In the hardware section, it offers way more than what we've mentioned! Which of these is what you look for in an ultra portable? pic.twitter.com/AqZbgolqu5 \n— Mi (@xiaomi) September 11, 2017 \nJust my opinion, but I actually think it looks better than the MacBook Pro . It’s confidently understated, and I’m a big fan of that bezel-less screen. \nBased on the design, specs, and name (which is as subtle as a punch in the jaw), Xiaomi is blatantly targeting people that would typically buy a MacBook Pro. It’s priced at 6399 Chinese yuan ($980), which is roughly half what the entry-level 15-inch MacBook Pro runs for ($1999). \nUnfortunately, as was the case with the Mi Notebook Air, Xiaomi is only selling this in China — at least at first. That means if you want to get your hands on one, you’ll either have to book a weekend break to Beijing, or hit up one of the ubiquitous resalers of Chinese gear, like GearBest or BangGood.",

      "title": "Dear Hollywood, we don’t need classics like 'Terminator 2' in 3D",
      "text": "Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the greatest films ever made. So what's the point of adding a 3D veneer to bring it back to theaters? Not much, it turns out. In exchange for a slight touch of artificial depth, I found the remaster darker and occasionally blurrier than the original. But really, this isn't anything new. I had a similar experience a few years ago with the re-release of Jurassic Park -- another classic film that was brought back to theaters just for the novelty of seeing it in 3D. As I sat in Brooklyn's mostly empty Alamo Drafthouse theater this week, I couldn't help but wonder: When will Hollywood realize these 3D re-releases are a huge waste of time?\nI'm not against bringing back older films in theaters, especially when they've been cleaned up with a spiffy digital restoration. It's a great way to let audiences experience classics on the big screen -- the way they were meant to be seen. But the 3D experience typically adds little to those movies. Since they weren't shot with 3D in mind, the additional depth is usually subtle. And in cases where it's more pronounced, it tends to feel forced. These remasters are also stuck with the usual caveats for 3D presentation (more on that below). Ultimately, retrofitting older films with 3D simply feels like a naked grab for higher ticket prices.\nI won't say 3D is entirely useless in theaters. Films like Avatar , Hugo and Gravity have used the technology to deliver truly unique and immersive experiences that wouldn't be possible with 2D alone. But most 3D films aren't worth the effort of slipping on a pair of glasses. And you pay dearly in terms of quality too. The 3D shades block out light, just like sunglasses, which leads to a duller and less vibrant image. Many theaters also don't run their projectors at the proper brightness (I'm looking at you, UA Court Street), which makes things even darker. All in all, with 3D you often end up paying more for something that looks significantly worse than a standard 2D screening.\nAnd there are other issues with 3D as well. If you wear glasses, you have to balance another pair of specs on your nose. You can make a film look blurry or out of focus just by resting your head the wrong way. And there are some people who can't even register 3D images properly, and instead see a blurrier overall image. While Hollywood isn't exactly slowing down with 3D films, some big companies, like IMAX (which ironically helped to kick off the whole 3D trend), are ready to move past it . You can still enjoy an immersive cinematic experience, like I did with Dunkirk on IMAX , without going 3D. All you need is a bright and sharp image, along with great sound design.\nWhen it comes to Terminator 2 , the 3D was most pronounced in the big action set pieces, and in scenes involving its iconic villain, the liquid metal T-1000. But, this being a film I've seen dozens of times, some of the uses of 3D simply felt distracting instead of immersive. Sometimes objects in the foreground were blurred out to shift the focus to the main characters deeper in the frame, but it just felt like there was something blocking my view of the characters. And, as usual, the overall image was darker than I would have liked. That was particularly surprising because the Alamo Drafthouse is dedicated to delivering the best movie presentation possible. It wasn't their fault the image was dark -- it was the fact I was watching it in 3D.\nThe best aspects of the T2 remaster didn't involve 3D at all. The film looked cleaner than my current Blu-ray, and night scenes looked sharper, with less grain. But of course, those are improvements we could have had with a standard remaster job. Instead of wasting time and resources on a T2 3D tune-up, I would rather have seen remasters of The Abyss and True Lies , two other James Cameron classics that aren't even available on Blu-ray today. (Cameron assures us they're coming eventually .)\nStudio Canal/Carolco Terminator 2: 3D has made just over $1 million in theaters since it debuted on August 25th, according to Box Office Mojo . In Hollywood terms, that's a disappointing showing, especially since T2 ended up being the highest-grossing movie ever in its time, taking in more than $520 million globally. Jurassic Park 3D , meanwhile, earned $65 million during its theatrical run in 2014, helping to bring the film's overall take since its original release to more than $1 billion. While that was undoubtedly a success, you could attribute many of those sales to an audience that just really wanted to see more Jurassic Park. (In 2015, the so-so Jurassic World also had a solid global run, earning more than $1.6 billion.)\nInstead of paying for an expensive 3D conversion, Hollywood studios would be better off investing in standard 4K remasters of classic films. Sure, that's not as high a resolution as 35mm film, but it still looks great when projected in modern theaters. It also gives them new versions of films that they can easily resell on 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray and VOD. Ultimately, the path forward is simple: Just let us see classic films in the best quality, without wearing shades.",

      "text": "The UN wants all drones registered in a global database Good luck with that. Save Jason Lee / Reuters \nThe United Nations' aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), plans to support a single worldwide drone registry. This singular ledger would be easier for law enforcement to sift through than each country's individual UAV ledger. \nThat might irk US hobbyists, who fought and defeated the FAA in court when it passed a law to force drone owners to sign up for an American registry . The contentious case ended in a decision that classified non-commercial drones as model aircraft, which don't need to be nationally registered. Whether the US drone community cooperates with ICAO's registry is another question. \nConceivably, the UN agency could run the database itself, though no department has been officially tasked to do it. But the registry is likely a precursor to the global regulations on drone flying and tracking that ICAO has been asked to help create, according to Reuters. They could pattern their rules after any of three likely examples: The US's regulations for commercial UAVs, China's registration rules or the anticipated set coming out of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). \nBut the skies only keep getting busier. In the aftermath of hurricane Harvey and the impending Irma, a record number of drones operated by state and local agencies have been speedily greenlit to fly by the FAA, which is finding new ways to parse out legitimate UAV activity from illegal flights.",

      "text": "iOS 11 leak reveals the LTE-enabled Apple Watch It'll apparently come in several variants, including 'blush gold' and 'ceramic gray.' Save Engadget \nA copy of iOS 11 in its final development stage has leaked online, and 9to5mac has dissected the software to reveal the secrets we're bound to hear during Apple's upcoming event . One of the publication's most notable discoveries is an image of what seems to be the LTE-enabled Apple Watch from within the wearable's app. It has a black Sport band, which indicates that the current bands will also fit the new model, and an eye-catching red Digital Crown. The most telling part of the image, though, is the watchface: it has a signal indicator in the middle that signifies cellular connection, as well as a phone and a navigation icon. [Image credit: 9to5mac] \nIn addition to finding evidence of the Watch Series 3 model, 9to5mac also found references to its variants, which include \"blush gold\" and \"ceramic gray.\" The \"blush gold\" Series 3 version might feature an aluminum case to go with the upcoming iPhones' new shade of gold that's deeper than anything Apple has done before, while the gray ceramic could be either a replacement of or an alternative to the white ceramic variant. We only have a few days to know for sure -- Apple is slated to launch its new iPhone(s) and all its new devices on September 12th.",

      "text": "What to expect from the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X Posted Advertisement After months of rumors and leaks, the next iPhone is just days from being unveiled at Apple’s brand new Steve Jobs Theater . So, what do we know so far? Typical of Apple leaks in recent years, we’ve heard trickles of information on just about every piece of the new device, but, as always, everything is still up in the air. The screen, the camera, the pricing — even the name has been subject to debate in recent weeks. \nThere does seem to be a bit of clarification on the latter point, courtesy of a massive iOS 11 software leak that hit this weekend. Turns out the reason so many names have been floating around is simple: Apple’s releasing a bunch of phones. In addition to the expected iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, we’ll also likely be getting a third: the iPhone X . Here’s a break down of what we think we know about the phones so far. Price \nMuch to Apple’s chagrin, this is going to be one of the phone’s most discussed new features. Samsung took flack for pricing the Note 8 at just under $1,000, and the rumors are true, that’s nothing compared to what Cupertino’s got cooking. Various reports have priced the premium model around $1,000 to $1,200. Of course, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will almost certainly slot in at cheaper price points, and Apple’s never been known for its cost savings. But this would be in line with the recent trend toward skyrocketing pricing points as companies look to distinguish themselves with flagship features. Display \nNo surprise, the screen will be the primary driver of that unwieldy price tag — and a familiar name is behind the hike. Apple’s move to OLED on its premium model could bump its per device cost from ~$50 for LCDs to~$125. So, what does an upgrade get you? More accurate colors, better uniformity across the screen and improved power management among others features. It doesn’t sound like much, but if the LGV30 is any indication, it will be a stunning thing to behold. \nAnd then, of course, there’s the notch. Essential braced us for this a bit with its first phone , but the cutout at the top of the screen looks to be more pronounced on the new iPhone. That said, we didn’t find it a major detriment to using the phone in our experience. Design is at the core of Apple’s DNA, and the company has no doubt been pushing for ways to make it go largely unnoticed. Expect the transition to be easiest on the company’s own apps first, as third parties work to keep up with the design. The good news is there will be a lot more screen real estate jammed into a smaller form factor, including a virtually bezel-free design. Camera \nOf course, dual cameras are expected to be on-board here yet again — though this time out, they’ll stack vertically, rather than horizontally, according to reference designs. The biggest upgrade here is much improved depth sensing. Though it ought to make the camera even better at the bokeh effect the company trotted out on past devices, but the implications are much bigger. \nWhile Tim Cook has afforded virtual reality a little love (including development for HTC and Oculus’s handsets), he’s long said he anticipates that AR will be much bigger in the short term. And if the deluge of ARKit programs we’ve seen pop up since it went live are any indication, we can expect some really amazing things on that front. But a truly lifelike augmented reality experience is going to require much more robust on-board depth sensing. And from the sound of it, the iPhone X, at least, will be the phone to deliver it. Face ID \nFacial unlock has been one of the most consistent rumors in the lead-up to the new phones, and this weekend, it appears to have finally gotten a name: Face ID . The same leak also points to an animation for setting up the feature that involves the user moving their face around for the camera —not dissimilar to what we’ve all been doing for years now in the fingerprint scanning setup process. \nA leak discovered via HomePod, meanwhile, points to the feature’s (then codenamed: Pearl ID) ability to unlock a phone even while lying flat on a table . Face ID also seems likely to feature some integration with third-party apps at or near launch. \nThe addition of face scanning could mean a couple of things for the old familiar fingerprint scanner/home button. A generation after moving to the more failsafe “taptic engine,” Apple could switch to a virtual scanner housed on the iPhone’s screen — similar to what Samsung does on its Galaxy devices. Newly surfaced rumors also heralded the end of the fingerprint scanner and home button on the X. It would be a bold move and, depending on the efficacy of the technology Apple employs, a potential safety concern. As we pointed out in a piece last week, companies like Samsung don’t regard their own Face Unlock feature as on-par with more advanced biometrics. \nThat said, the leaked set-up process points to a phone that benefits from added depth-sensing cameras — something Apple is definitely keen to bring on board as it works to boost excitement around ARKit applications. The addition of more complex images with depth reading could ultimately make it much harder to fool Face ID with a simple picture. Availability \nThis is bound to be another sticking point among critics. Numerous reports have stated (and we’ve independently confirmed) that the iPhone X is going to ship later than its low end brethren . This appears to be another hiccup introduced when Apple opted to with those OLED units on the premium models. How long the delay will actually be is still up the air — there’s a decent chance the company might not mention an ETA for fear of missing the mark. The delay could impact Apple’s bottomline by pushing more people to buy a cheaper model, but there’s a lot to be said to getting it right the first time. ",

      "text": "A perfect storm of corporate idiocy Posted How we built a newspaper in 72 hours At this point in the game there should be a single page on every corporate website, preferably accessible from its front page, that includes the name and all contact details for the Chief Security Officer, including the last four digits of her social security number. It should be her responsibility to ensure that no one uses this information for nefarious purposes in addition to her daily operations. This honeypot should inspire the this CSO to go to great lengths to protect herself and her company’s data. \nIt’s only fair, right? \nThis person – who in Equifax’s case was named John Kelley III and earned nearly $3 million for releasing 143 million customer records (about 2 cents per record) – should also be the first to be fired during a breach. Further, this person should no longer work in “security” and instead be relegated where he can do less damage, perhaps in food service but not food preparation. \nI doubt they’d be trustworthy enough to fry a hamburger. \nI know it’s a little Hunger Games but I think that’s where we are in 2017. Corporate security is an afterthought. \nI propose this for a simple reason: no one else on Equifax’s corporate leadership board works on security. There are plenty of folks dedicate to sales and revenue growth but only Kelley has “has responsibility for legal services, global sourcing, security and compliance, government and legislative relations and more.” He’s a lawyer. \nBreaches are an affront to decades of innovation and research. Breaches are an affront to ethics, customer support, and trust. Breaches are an affront to shareholders and those who depended on Equifax for, arguably, a ridiculous service in these days of trust-less networks and powerful data mining tools. \nAdd in a clearly inept team at, we assume, Edelman, and you have a perfect storm of corporate idiocy. Look at this: \nYesterday I tried Equifax’s “security checker”/Wordpress instance yesterday, September 8. It said: \nApparently, however, you could type in Booger/123456 and get the same answer. Now, thanks to what we can assume was some interference by Equifax’s legal department, nobody is affected, not even Booger. \nThat’s right: it went from “Yeah, you’re definitely probably hacked” to “No, you’re probably not hacked” overnight. This tool should be burnt down. \nIn short, Equifax can’t protect your data, can’t build a website, and can’t get its story straight. And this is a publicly-traded company with a century of tradition and trust behind it. \nWhy am I so angry at this? Imagine John Kelley III had a box of family photos. He sent those family photos to a service for digitization. Those photos included tender moments, pictures loved ones dead and gone, and snaps joyous occasions. There’s ap picture there of him passing the bar, of getting married, of saying goodbye to his father. This photo digitization service did the job – poorly, to be clear, because we’re equating it to Equifax – and then threw the box of photos with full identifying information onto the street. John Kelley’s grandmother’s photo was used to create a fake ID. John Kelley’s birthday party pic was posted to Facebook and someone figured out his birthdate or some other piece of trivial information and opened a credit card in his name. Trolls found a picture of his car, deduced its location, and cut the brake lines. The list of offenses can go on ad nauseam. \nNow imagine the same thing is happening to you. Almost monthly your family photos, your birth certificate, and your diary are being ransacked or nearly ransacked by criminals. Your valuables are being broadcast to those who would like to steal them. Imagine that the companies you trust with your health, wealth, and privacy are leaking your information almost daily and that the tools used to secure that data are infuriatingly easy to crack as possible. You’d be mad as hell and you wouldn’t take it anymore. \nBut you aren’t. And you do. \nUntil John Kelley III is held accountable, until everyone who leaks our data and uses weak tools and methods to secure our data is out of a job, we will not be safe. Sure, many of us have little to hide but it is our right to nonetheless hide what little we do have. Corporate security talks a big game but fails every time. That has to change. 0",

      "text": "How to Solve the Biggest Mystery in Physics James O’Brien/Quanta Magazine Suppose aliens land on our planet and want to learn our current scientific knowledge. I would start with the 40-year-old documentary Powers of Ten . Granted, it’s a bit out of date, but this short film, written and directed by the famous designer couple Charles and Ray Eames, captures in less than 10 minutes a comprehensive view of the cosmos. Quanta Magazine About \nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. The script is simple and elegant. When the film begins, we see a couple picnicking in a Chicago park. Then the camera zooms out. Every 10 seconds the field of vision gains a power of 10—from 10 meters across, to 100, to 1,000 and onward. Slowly the big picture reveals itself to us. We see the city, the continent, Earth, the solar system, neighboring stars, the Milky Way, all the way to the largest structures of the universe. Then in the second half of the film, the camera zooms in and delves into the smallest structures, uncovering more and more microscopic details. We travel into a human hand and discover cells, the double helix of the DNA molecule, atoms, nuclei and finally the elementary quarks vibrating inside a proton. The movie captures the astonishing beauty of the macrocosm and microcosm, and it provides the perfect cliffhanger endings for conveying the challenges of fundamental science. As our then-8-year-old son asked when he first saw it, “How does it continue?” Exactly! Comprehending the next sequence is the aim of scientists who are pushing the frontiers of our understanding of the largest and smallest structures of the universe. Finally, I could explain what Daddy does at work! Powers of Ten also teaches us that, while we traverse the various scales of length, time and energy, we also travel through different realms of knowledge. Psychology studies human behavior, evolutionary biology examines ecosystems, astrophysics investigates planets and stars, and cosmology concentrates on the universe as a whole. Similarly, moving inward, we navigate the subjects of biology, biochemistry, and atomic, nuclear and particle physics. It is as if the scientific disciplines are formed in strata, like the geological layers on display in the Grand Canyon. Moving from one layer to another, we see examples of emergence and reductionism, these two overarching organizing principles of modern science. Zooming out, we see new patterns “emerge” from the complex behavior of individual building blocks. Biochemical reactions give rise to sentient beings. Individual organisms gather into ecosystems. Hundreds of billions of stars come together to make majestic swirls of galaxies. As we reverse and take a microscopic view, we see reductionism at work. Complicated patterns dissolve into underlying simple bits. Life reduces to the reactions among DNA, RNA, proteins and other organic molecules. The complexity of chemistry flattens into the elegant beauty of the quantum mechanical atom. And, finally, the Standard Model of particle physics captures all known components of matter and radiation in just four forces and 17 elementary particles. Which of these two scientific principles, reductionism or emergence, is more powerful? Traditional particle physicists would argue for reductionism; condensed-matter physicists, who study complex materials, for emergence. As articulated by the Nobel laureate (and particle physicist) David Gross: Where in nature do you find beauty, and where do you find garbage? Take a look at the complexity of reality around us. Traditionally, particle physicists explain nature using a handful of particles and their interactions. But condensed matter physicists ask: What about an everyday glass of water? Describing its surface ripples in terms of the motions of the roughly 10 24 individual water molecules—let alone their elementary particles—would be foolish. Instead of the impenetrable complexities at small scales (the “garbage”) faced by traditional particle physicists, condensed matter physicists use the emergent laws, the “beauty” of hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. In fact, when we take the number of molecules to infinity (the equivalent of maximal garbage from a reductionist point of view), these laws of nature become crisp mathematical statements. While many scientists praise the phenomenally successful reductionist approach of the past centuries, John Wheeler, the influential Princeton University physicist whose work touched on topics from nuclear physics to black holes, expressed an interesting alternative. “Every law of physics, pushed to the extreme, will be found to be statistical and approximate, not mathematically perfect and precise,” he said. Wheeler pointed out an important feature of emergent laws: Their approximate nature allows for a certain flexibility that can accommodate future evolution. In many ways, thermodynamics is the gold standard of an emergent law, describing the collective behavior of a large number of particles, irrespective of many microscopic details. It captures an astonishingly wide class of phenomena in succinct mathematical formulas. The laws hold in great universality—indeed, they were discovered before the atomic basis of matter was even established. And there are no loopholes. For example, the second law of thermodynamics states that a system’s entropy—a measure of the amount of hidden microscopic information—will always grow in time. Modern physics provides a precise language to capture the way things scale: the so-called renormalization group . This mathematical formalism allows us to go systematically from the small to the large. The essential step is taking averages. For example, instead of looking at the behavior of individual atoms that make up matter, we can take little cubes, say 10 atoms wide on each side, and take these cubes as our new building blocks. One can then repeat this averaging procedure. It is as if for each physical system one makes an individual Powers of Ten movie. Renormalization theory describes in detail how the properties of a physical system change if one increases the length scale on which the observations are made. A famous example is the electric charge of particles that can increase or decrease depending on quantum interactions. A sociological example is understanding the behavior of groups of various sizes starting from individual behavior. Is there wisdom in crowds, or do the masses behave less responsibly? Most interesting are the two endpoints of the renormalization process: the infinite large and infinite small. Here things will typically simplify because either all details are washed away, or the environment disappears. We see something like this with the two cliffhanger endings in Powers of Ten . Both the largest and the smallest structures of the universe are astonishingly simple. It is here that we find the two “standard models,” of particle physics and cosmology. Remarkably, modern insights about the most formidable challenge in theoretical physics—the push to develop a quantum theory of gravity —employ both the reductionist and emergent perspectives. Traditional approaches to quantum gravity, such as perturbative string theory, try to find a fully consistent microscopic description of all particles and forces. Such a “final theory” necessarily includes a theory of gravitons, the elementary particles of the gravitational field. For example, in string theory, the graviton is formed from a string that vibrates in a particular way. One of the early successes of string theory was a scheme to compute the behavior of such gravitons. However, this is only a partial answer. Einstein taught us that gravity has a much wider scope: It addresses the structure of space and time. In a quantum-mechanical description, space and time would lose their meaning at ultrashort distances and time scales, raising the question of what replaces those fundamental concepts. A complementary approach to combining gravity and quantum theory started with the groundbreaking ideas of Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking on the information content of black holes in the 1970s, and came into being with the seminal work of Juan Maldacena in the late 1990s. In this formulation, quantum space-time, including all the particles and forces in it, emerges from a completely different “holographic” description . The holographic system is quantum mechanical, but doesn’t have any explicit form of gravity in it. Furthermore, it typically has fewer spatial dimensions. The system is, however, governed by a number that measures how large the system is. If one increases that number, the approximation to a classical gravitational system becomes more precise. In the end, space and time, together with Einstein’s equations of general relativity, emerge out of the holographic system. The process is akin to the way that the laws of thermodynamics emerge out of the motions of individual molecules. More Quanta",

      "text": "How to Solve the Biggest Mystery in Physics   Suppose aliens land on our planet and want to learn our current scientific knowledge. I would start with the 40-year-old documentary Powers of Ten . Granted, it’s a bit out of date, but this short film, written and directed by the famous designer couple Charles and Ray Eames, captures in less than 10 minutes a comprehensive view of the cosmos. Quanta Magazine About \nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine , an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. The script is simple and elegant. When the film begins, we see a couple picnicking in a Chicago park. Then the camera zooms out. Every 10 seconds the field of vision gains a power of 10—from 10 meters across, to 100, to 1,000 and onward. Slowly the big picture reveals itself to us. We see the city, the continent, Earth, the solar system, neighboring stars, the Milky Way, all the way to the largest structures of the universe. Then in the second half of the film, the camera zooms in and delves into the smallest structures, uncovering more and more microscopic details. We travel into a human hand and discover cells, the double helix of the DNA molecule, atoms, nuclei and finally the elementary quarks vibrating inside a proton. The movie captures the astonishing beauty of the macrocosm and microcosm, and it provides the perfect cliffhanger endings for conveying the challenges of fundamental science. As our then-8-year-old son asked when he first saw it, “How does it continue?” Exactly! Comprehending the next sequence is the aim of scientists who are pushing the frontiers of our understanding of the largest and smallest structures of the universe. Finally, I could explain what Daddy does at work! Powers of Ten also teaches us that, while we traverse the various scales of length, time and energy, we also travel through different realms of knowledge. Psychology studies human behavior, evolutionary biology examines ecosystems, astrophysics investigates planets and stars, and cosmology concentrates on the universe as a whole. Similarly, moving inward, we navigate the subjects of biology, biochemistry, and atomic, nuclear and particle physics. It is as if the scientific disciplines are formed in strata, like the geological layers on display in the Grand Canyon. Moving from one layer to another, we see examples of emergence and reductionism, these two overarching organizing principles of modern science. Zooming out, we see new patterns “emerge” from the complex behavior of individual building blocks. Biochemical reactions give rise to sentient beings. Individual organisms gather into ecosystems. Hundreds of billions of stars come together to make majestic swirls of galaxies. \n[embedded content] As we reverse and take a microscopic view, we see reductionism at work. Complicated patterns dissolve into underlying simple bits. Life reduces to the reactions among DNA, RNA, proteins and other organic molecules. The complexity of chemistry flattens into the elegant beauty of the quantum mechanical atom. And, finally, the Standard Model of particle physics captures all known components of matter and radiation in just four forces and 17 elementary particles.

More Quanta Mathematicians Bridge the Divide Between Infinity and the Physical World \nNatalie Wolchover The Man Who’s Trying to Kill Dark Matter \nNatalie Wolchover Quantum Gravity Research Could Unearth the True Nature of Time In some sense, this exercise is exactly the opposite of what Einstein tried to achieve. His aim was to build all of the laws of nature out of the dynamics of space and time, reducing physics to pure geometry. For him, space-time was the natural “ground level” in the infinite hierarchy of scientific objects—the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The present point of view thinks of space-time not as a starting point, but as an end point, as a natural structure that emerges out of the complexity of quantum information, much like the thermodynamics that rules our glass of water. Perhaps, in retrospect, it was not an accident that the two physical laws that Einstein liked best, thermodynamics and general relativity, have a common origin as emergent phenomena. In some ways, this surprising marriage of emergence and reductionism allows one to enjoy the best of both worlds. For physicists, beauty is found at both ends of the spectrum. TAGS",

      "title": "Even more US adults now getting news from social media, says Pew | TechCrunch",
      "text": "Even more US adults now getting news from social media, says Pew Posted A perfect storm of corporate idiocy New research by Pew suggests there has been another increase in the proportion of U.S. adults getting news via social media platforms. \nIn May last year the researcher reported that 62 per cent of American adults were obtaining news from tech platforms, saying 18 per cent were doing so often. Now, in it’s latest survey , it says two-thirds (67%) of U.S. adults are reporting getting at least some of their news on social media. While a fifth (20%) report doing so “often”. \nAnd while it’s not a huge increase, it is nonetheless a rise (Pew terms it a “modest” increase). \nAnd a concerning one, given that the main social media purveyor of news — Facebook — has a demonstrable disinterest in and/or incapacity to distinguish fact from nonsensical fiction on its platform. \nIndeed, as many have already pointed out Facebook’s business benefits from increased user engagement, and made-up stories that play to people’s prejudices and/or contain wild, socially divisive claims have been shown to be able to clock up far more Facebook views than factual reports of actual news. \nSo any rise in news consumption on social media should give pause for thought — especially as Facebook (and Google, principally) continues to suck ad revenue away from traditional media outlets, threatening the sustainability of businesses that have traditionally played a key role in a functioning democracy. \nPew’s survey is based on responses from 4,971 U.S. adults who are members of the Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel. The research was carried out between August 8-21, 2017. \nIt said it found that growth in news consumption across social media platforms is being driven by increases among Americans who are “older, less educated and non-white” — noting that for the first time in Pew Research Center surveys more than half (55%) of Americans aged 50 or older report getting news on social media sites — up 10 percentage points from 2016. \nPew found that three of the social media platforms it asked about in 2017 — Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat — had an increase in the share of their audience that gets news on each site. \nAbout three-quarters (74%) of Twitter users reported getting news on the site, up 15 percentage points from early 2016. \nWhile about a third of YouTube’s users (32%) now get news from the site, up from 21% in early 2016 — so a rise of 11 percentage points. \nAnd consuming news also rose among Snapchat’s user base — with 29% currently saying they are doing this, up from 17% in early 2016, so an increase of 12 percentage points. \nStill, Facebook remains the primary social media platform for sourcing news for the U.S. population as a whole — with just under half (45%) of all U.S. adults reporting they get news on the site (aka a large majority — 68% — of Facebook’s user base). \nHow times change. Just a year ago Facebook was pooh-poohing the notion that the social mega-platform is playing the role of a media company. ‘We are mere tech platform’ was the refrain in September 2016 , despite how its algorithms select and order news-related content for billions of users. \nBy December , and following the fake news backlash after the US election result, that line was approaching the breaking point of credibility, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg conceded Facebook might indeed be a media company — though he suggested it’s not a ‘traditional’ one. \nAnd that is surely true. No other media entity on Earth has enjoyed such vast reach and power . \nLittle wonder Russian agents spied potential to sew social division across the U.S. population as the country was headed into the salient point of an election cycle by purchasing, targeting and distributing politically charged ads via the platform — as Facebook this week revealed had been the case. \nIt reported that an in-house investigation found pro-Kremlin entities appear to have purchased around $100,000 in political marketing on the platform between 2015 and 2016. \nThe company has so far resisted pressure to publicly reveal the ads purchased by Russian entities. This is complete nonsense. First, the Russians who violated law and policy have no privacy rights on their ads. https://t.co/xkqvTtbZIP \n— Pierre Omidyar (@pierre) September 8, 2017 \nReturning to Pew’s report, its survey also found news consumption growing among YouTube’s (also growing) user-base — saying the Google/Alphabet-owned user generated video platform is now the second most common social media site for news, with roughly two-in-ten (18%) of all U.S. adults getting news there. \nFor Twitter, Pew said that while a very large share of its users (74 per cent) obtain news via the site, given that its user base is also significantly smaller than Facebook’s or YouTube’s this results in a smaller overall reach for news: With just 11% of U.S. adults get news via Twitter. \nThe researcher concluded that Americans are now more likely than ever to report getting news from multiple social media sites — with around a quarter of all U.S. adults (26%) getting news from two or more sites, up from 18% in 2016. \nIn additional research it also said its data shows the Internet is closing in on television as a source of news. As of August 2017, 43% of Americans report often getting news online, compared with 50% who often get news on television — so just a seven-percentage-point gap. While in early 2016 the gap between the two news platforms was 19 points. \nSo, in short, the Internet’s social platform giants are busily consuming broadcast/TV news media, not just print. 0 ",

      "text": "Equifax tries to explain its response to a massive security breach And here's what you should do next. Save shutterstock \nA day after announcing that hackers stole personal information tied to 143 million people in the US , Equifax's response to the breach has come under scrutiny. Language on the website where people could find out if they were affected seemed to say that by signing up they would waive any right to join a class action suit against the company -- something New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said is \"unacceptable and unenforceable.\" The company has since explained it does not apply to the data breach at all, but that hasn't stopped misinformation from spreading. After conversations w my office, @Equifax has clarified its policy re: arbitration. We are continuing to closely review. pic.twitter.com/WcPZ9OqMcL — Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) September 8, 2017 \nEquifax: \nIn response to consumer inquiries, we have made it clear that the arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cybersecurity incident, \nOf course, considering the extent of what has leaked and the number of people affected, a hyperbolic reaction to anything surrounding this incident is understandable. A group claiming to be the hackers behind the theft has threatened to release it unless paid a ransom, but there's no confirmation yet that they actually have anything. As far as how it happened, one analyst told the New York Post that Equifax attributed the hack to the exploitation of a flaw in the Apache STRUTS system. Still, there are a few steps that people can and should take, now that we know someone has stolen more than enough information to perpetrate identity theft on a massive scale. \nNow that the language has been clarified, it appears legally clear to use Equifax's website to check things out. Among Engadget staff, a few of us received notices that we aren't among those impacted, but most weren't so lucky. Still, there are questions about how secure the site itself is, since it requests the last six digits of each person' social security number (and guessing first three isn't as hard as you might think). Also, it doesn't appear to work particularly well , responding to test and \"gibberish\" input with a claim that it's part of the breach also. \nThe best information on how to respond is available from the FTC . The government agency lays out solid next steps, like checking your credit report for any suspicious entries, as well as placing a freeze (there's more advice on that here ) and/or fraud alert on your account with the major credit bureaus. This will make it harder for a thief to create a fake account for you and should force creditors to verify your identity. Finally, it's important to file your taxes early, before a scammer potentially can.",

Save JamCity \nApparently, the folks over at Nerdist \"spend every waking hour of every day wishing that Futurama was still on TV.\" We're big fans of the show, for sure, but we still spend a few hours during our days thinking of other things, like anime parodies and South Park , for instance. The Nerdist crew, however, has taken their rabid fandom to a whole new level. On September 14th, the team will debut a brand new Futurama episode as a radio play on the Nerdist podcast . The new one-shot will run long at 42 minutes and will feature the original cast in a story written by original Futurama writers. \nThe podcast is sponsored by TinyCo's Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow , which already includes in-game content from the new storyline. The game is already a brand-new Futurama episode in itself, so finding even more bonus stuff from the upcoming story could be a ton of fun, as well. The new radio play will reunite Fry, Bender, Leela, Professor Farnsworth, Zoidberg, Amy and Hermes as they try to stop Klaxxon, a being made up of soundwaves from, wait for it, podcasts from the 21st century. The Planet Express team meets the evil creature on a routine mission to the deleted file planet, Junkleon 7. \n\"Last year I cornered two fine gentlemen--Matt Groening & David X. Cohen--and pitched the idea of doing a new Futurama episode as a podcast/radio play because it's one of my favorite things and I need more of it,\" said Nerdist 's Chris Hardwick in a statement. \"Today I am drooling with unfiltered joy to say that a) it's actually happening, b) I got to voice the villain (Klaxxon), and c) I'm a freaking head in a jar in Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow , a game I've been feverishly playing since it came out. Galaxies of thanks to Matt, David and TinyCo for acquiescing to the maniacal ravings of a well-meaning fanboy.\" ",

      "title": "Facebook adds a dedicated “Movies” section offering showtimes and ticket sales",
      "text": "Some Facebook users have noticed a new section called “Movies” appearing in the mobile app’s main navigation. The feature, which has just appeared for many U.S. Facebook users, offers a way to see which movies are playing nearby, available showtimes and a list of local theaters and their movie selections. The section is powered through an integration with Fandango’s and Atom Tickets’ booking services, which means you can also buy a movie ticket right from the “Movies” section itself.\nThis is not the first time Facebook has powered movie ticket sales, to be clear.\nLast fall, it introduced a way for visitors to Facebook Pages to take various actions, like getting Quote: s, buying event tickets from Ticketmaster and buying movie tickets, among other things. At the time, the movie ticket sales were being made possible through a partnership with Fandango, and had begun with just a few titles in U.S. theaters, like The Magnificent Seven, Storks and others.\nThe interface for those movie ticket sales from Facebook Pages looks just like the one you’ll see from the Facebook app’s “Movies” section, currently.\nThat indicates this is more of an expansion of the existing relationship with Fandango, rather than something entirely new to Facebook. That is, instead of having to visit an individual movie’s Facebook Page to start the purchasing process, you can just go to a single destination in the Facebook app. That makes it simpler to see all the movies playing nearby and complete your transaction.\nFor Fandango, its interest in working with Facebook went beyond purchasing ease, Paul Yanover, Fandango’s president, told The New York Times last fall. It was also about the ability to connect groups of friends who would go see movies together.\nBut for Facebook, the feature is now one of many that have launched in its main navigation in recent months, as the social network is shaping up to become a portal that offers anything you’d need online. In other words, Facebook wants to keep you in its app instead of having you turn to Google, or seek out other mobile apps to perform a task, get information, use a service, etc.\nFor example, the company has added features to its app’s main navigation that include a way to order food delivery; a Town Hall for connecting with local, state and national government representatives; access to your daily weather and forecast; an Explore feed for finding new Facebook Pages you might like; a selection of trending news items; a way to watch the top Live videos; a QR code scanner; a Wi-Fi finder ; easier access to Safety Check; a networking-focused “Discover People” section; and many other options. And that’s not the complete list.\nWe understand that the Facebook “Movies” button is considered a test, and has been slowly expanding to users across the U.S.\nThat means some of you will have seen this option long before now, while others are only newly seeing it. It’s very difficult to tell when Facebook actually launches new features, because of how it tests products with small audiences, then larger ones and then sometimes decides to yank the feature or make it publicly available.\nMovie tickets aren’t the only type of ticket that Facebook is selling these days, we should also note. Its “Marketplace” section is rolling out a “ticket sales” section , too, which allows local event hosts to promote their events inside Facebook’s Craigslist-like feature.\nPost updated 9/9/17, 9:30 AM ET, as an Atom Tickets integration has now gone live.\n0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "Apple’s iOS 11 Will Make It Even Harder for Cops to Extract Your Data Joseph Branston/T3 Magazine/Getty Images Since Apple locked down its iPhones three years ago with encryption that even the company itself can’t break, it has been in a cold war with the cops—one that has occasionally turned hot. Exhibit A: its legal standoff with the FBI over the seized iPhone of San Bernadino killer Syed Rizwan Farook. Now, 18 months after that showdown, Apple is adding yet more features that are designed to guard your digital privacy from anyone who nabs your iPhone—whether it's a mugger on the street or the policeman who just threw you in jail. Security researchers and forensic analysts who've seen early developer versions of iOS 11, expected to be announced at Apple's launch event tomorrow, say its new features include tweaks designed to make extracting the data from a seized phone far more difficult without the phone's six-digit passcode. And while those changes seem aimed at protecting iPhone users' data from run-of-the-mill thieves and snooping boyfriends, it could also mark another escalation in Apple's tensions with law enforcement officials and customs agents who want the ability to extract data wholesale from the phones of criminal suspects and travelers at the border. From the perspective of those government agents, \"this will be a major pain in the ass,\" says Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California at Berkeley. \"Apple wants to live in a world where the phone in your hands is super valuable, but in anyone else’s hands is a brick...If that messes up police's and customs' forensic dumps? So what. The benefits outweigh the harm.\" A Less Promiscuous Port According to a blog post from Russian forensics software firm Elcomsoft on Thursday, Apple has made at least two significant changes to iOS 11 that will create new hurdles for those trying to access the innards of a seized iPhone. First, they've added a crucial step to the process of moving a phone's contents to a forensic analyst's desktop computer, a change that could significantly reduce the amount of data police can access on seized phones—even if they manage to confiscate them in an unlocked state. In recent versions of iOS, any iPhone plugged into an unfamiliar computer would ask the user if he or she was willing to trust that new machine before exchanging any data with it. That meant if cops or border agents were able to seize an unlocked iPhone or compel its owner to unlock a locked one with a finger on its TouchID sensor, they could simply plug it into a desktop via a cable in its lightning port, choose to trust the new machine with a tap, and upload its contents using forensic software like Elcomsoft or Cellebrite. (That's particularly important because courts have found criminal suspects can't plead the Fifth Amendment and refuse to offer their fingerprints, as they sometimes can with a password or passcode.) But in iOS 11, iPhones will not only require a tap to trust a new computer, but the phone's passcode, too. That means even if forensic analysts do seize a phone while it's unlocked or use its owner's finger to unlock it, they still need a passcode to offload its data to a program where it can be analyzed wholesale. They can still flip through the data on the phone itself. But if the owner refuses to divulge the passcode, they can't use forensic tools to access its data in the far more digestible format for analysis known as SQLite. \"There’s a huge amount of data that can’t be effectively analyzed if you have to look at it manually,\" says Vladimir Katalov, Elcomsoft's co-founder. \"On my phone, I have more than 100,000 messages and several thousand call logs. The manual review of that data is not possible.\" Related Stories ",

      "text": "Mars: 2051\nIn the bitter cold of a martian winter, 30 remote-controlled robots walk out of a holding bay across the icy terrain to begin their day in the mines. They pile in to the latest autonomous, hydrogen-powered Waymo rover, power down and charge up at docking ports… It’s going to be a long day.\nMillions of miles away (roughly 33.9 million), in the Texas offices of Bechtel, 30 men and women are milling around the office, waiting to enter their cubicles and link up with their robot avatars. They’re chatting, drinking coffee, talking about the latest misadventures of Ivy Blue and North West.\nA push notification alerts them that the rover has reached the mine. They file in to their offices, put on their gloves and VR headsets (maybe at this point they actually jack in to a feed) and start guiding their robots through the treacherous paces of mining ice on Mars.\nBack in 2017 it’s hard to imagine that scenario could have its origins in the somewhat janky, certainly gimmicky stunts that SpaceVR is currently undertaking in sites around San Francisco, but the company, whose vision is bringing people to space through the power of VR and robotics, has to start somewhere.\nSo they’re starting… there.\nThe demonstrations of workers remotely operating robots that scoop ice cream or make tacos is little more than a publicity stunt. But it’s also an effective way to get at the singular vision of company founder and chief executive Ryan Holmes.\nHolmes believes that a stereoscopic experience with immersive visuals and remote operators is the best way to get at the promise offered by space. And the exploration of other planets is far closer than anyone thinks.\nElon Musk, for instance, has a definitive goal of launching a mission to Mars by 2020. “We were focused on 2018, but we felt like we needed to put more resources and focus more heavily on our crew program and our Falcon Heavy program. So we’re looking more for the 2020 timeframe for that,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said at a launch conference earlier this year.\nThe question remains what to do in space once you get there. Holmes sees robotics as the easiest answer. Robots are cheaper and easier to send to space than people by several orders of magnitude. And, if sensing technology improves in the decade til the company’s robots make it out to space, then it’s even easier to see the value.\nCompanies like Syntouch, in Los Angeles, are already working on making sensors that can transmit the sensation of touch across distances, and to add that to robots would just be extending work the company is already doing around prosthetics.\nHolmes has a set a target of deploying 10 million robots by the end of the decade. It’s an ambitious goal for someone with a crazy idea. But it’s a crazy idea that’s far closer to reality than the science fiction many may assume it is.\n“We are automating all human tasks. Taking a different approach than all major companies. Our general purpose avatar, Human, was just demoed last week doing tasks in SF, controlled by me from Mexico City,” Holmes wrote to me in an email.\n“First we’re going to undercut all labor prices by powering Human with low cost labor. Skipping all the major hurdles of perfect AI that all AI companies are facing. As these jobs are performed, we will introduce automation blocks one task at a time using the data gathered from the tasks being performed until all human tasks are automated.” He envisions that this will free up humans to do higher-value tasks. His company, which has been running demonstrations of its prototype remote-controlled robots around San Francisco, has high hopes for the interstellar market.\nWhile the remote-controlled robot, operated by a Vive headset and sensor-enabled gloves, is little more than a gimmick now, SpaceVR’s founder and chief executive has high hopes for the lowly machines.\nHolmes sees the robots as the second step in the company’s development. A means to get people comfortable with the stereoscopic manipulation and visualization capabilities that operating a robot from a VR headset can provide.\nUltimately, Holmes’ vision is to send millions of robots into space, operated by human controllers on earth to conduct tests and perform the manual labor on Mars that would be too expensive for a human to do.\nIt’s a wild vision, but one that may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Startups like Planetary Resources are already looking at the potential to mine asteroids for minerals, and others are exploring the opportunities for specialty manufacturing opportunities afforded by zero gravity.\nFeatured Image: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE 0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "The Music Industry Bands Together to Finally Get Paid Online Getty Images Last fall, a group of music industry heavyweights gathered in New York City to do something they’d mostly failed to do up to that point: work together. Representatives from major labels like Universal, Sony, and Warner sat next to technologists from companies like Spotify, YouTube, and Ideo and discussed the collective issues threatening their industry. And there were many. For decades, major labels have watched record sales nose dive. Meanwhile, streaming services are growing in popularity but drowning in lawsuits . In 1998, the industry reported revenue of $13.8 billion; in 2016 it had dipped to $7.65 billion—and that was considered a good year. “It’s a really fragmented industry,” says Dan Harple, founder of Context Labs and one of the organizers of the meeting. The participants of that confab would later form a group called the Open Music Initiative . The OMI got started in the winter of 2015, when Harple began working with Berklee's vice president of innovation and strategy, Panos A. Panay, Michael Hendrix of the design consultancy Ideo , and a handful of others at the school's Institute For Creative Entrepreneurship to establish a working group with sole purpose of figuring out how to ensure the music industry has a more sustainable future. Over the years, Harple's witnessed the power of technology change industries for the better; he’s also seen it wreak havoc on those that aren’t prepared. The music industry, he says, falls squarely into the latter category. After decades of building distribution channels around record contracts and sales, the micro-transactional nature of the internet has, in some ways, diluted the industry. “I like to make a joke that it’s akin to a FedEx guy who shows up and gets 80 percent of your product price,\" Harple says. \"To me, that’s in some ways what the App Store does and iTunes does and streaming services do.” Recommended Music Can't Last Forever, Not Even on the Internet Those might sound like fighting words, but Harple isn't against digital music. A trustee of the Berklee College of Music, he helped create internet standards like the Real Time Streaming Protocol, which powers the technology that lets you pause, play, fast forward, and rewind on applications like YouTube and QuickTime. And when it comes down to it, he says, everyone—from startups to legacy labels to publishing houses—faces the same underlying issue. “Pretty early on it was obvious that there's an information gap in the industry,” says Erik Beijnoff, a product developer at Spotify and a member of the OMI. That \"information gap\" refers to the data around who helped create a song. Publishers might keep track of who wrote the underlying composition of a song, or the session drummer on a recording, but that information doesn't always show up in a digital file's metadata. This disconnect between the person who composed a song, the person who recorded it, and the subsequent plays, has led to problems like writers and artists not getting paid for their work, and publishers suing streaming companies as they struggle to identify who is owed royalties. “It’s a simple question of attribution,” says Panay . “And payments follow attribution.” Over the last year, members of the OMI—almost 200 organizations in total—have worked to develop just that. As a first step, they’ve created an API that companies can voluntarily build into their systems to help identify key data points like the names of musicians and composers, plus how many times and where tracks are played. This information is then stored on a decentralized database using blockchain technology—which means no one owns the information, but everyone can access it. Think of it as a standardized set of liner notes. Keeping track of this metadata means artists and platforms can leverage it various ways without fear of violating rights. “What this API is allowing is real time access to information,” says Hendrix, a partner at IDEO who helped organize and develop the methodology behind the OMI. “That doesn’t exist today; it’s just too siloed.” Though the API is still in beta, members say it's a solid starting point for an industry that rarely shares information openly. The ripple effects go beyond money, too. Panay points to all the apps built on Twitter's API and says the flow of data within the music industry could encourage entrepreneurs to start new companies, developers to build new experiences , and musicians to get more creative with how they sample and produce music. “You can envision a world where any sound that's ever been created—any guitar lick, any drum loop, any synth line, any vocal—is accounted for,” Panay says. “If you have attribution to underlying contributors, you can imagine an explosion of creativity.” 9/9/2017: This story has been updated to include more detail about the formation of the OMI ",

      "text": "Facebook's widening role in electing Trump Blaming fake accounts isn’t Facebook’s get-out-of-jail-free card, apparently. Save Illustration by D. Thomas Magee \nFacebook admitted this week that a Russian propaganda mill used the social-media giant's ad service for political operation around the 2016 campaign. This came out when sources revealed to The Washington Post on Wednesday that Facebook was grilled by 2016 Russia-Trump congressional investigators behind closed doors Wednesday. US lawmakers are furious . \nPutin's propaganda farm bought around $150,000 in political ads from at least June 2015-May 2017; Facebook was compelled to share the information and will be cooperating with ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The troll farm in question is the Internet Research Agency , a well-funded, well-established, nimble, English-speaking, pro-Putin propaganda unit, and the ads are in all likelihood illegal. \nWhat this week's revelations about Facebook mean is that Facebook ads are now undeniably a form of political campaigning, one with no checks and balances. And people have been taking advantage of this, big time. \nThe total money spent (that Facebook would admit to) was allegedly responsible for around 3,000 ads, with the potential to reach millions of people. Facebook isn't saying how many people actually saw them. \nThere were an additional 2,200 ads Facebook said it suspected were also Russia-backed; the company has avoided making a positive statement. It's arguable that the world's biggest surveillance platform has the data to connect the dots; it simply isn't doing so for this problem. \nFacebook maintains that it is not culpable, only that the buyers violated Facebook's \"inauthentic accounts\" rule. The Washington Post wrote: \nFacebook discovered the Russian connection as part of an investigation that began this spring looking at purchasers of politically motivated ads, according to people familiar with the inquiry. It found that 3,300 ads had digital footprints that led to the Russian company. \nFacebook teams then discovered 470 suspicious and likely fraudulent Facebook accounts and pages that it believes operated out of Russia, had links to the company and were involved in promoting the ads. \nThe language that Facebook \"discovered\" this is disingenuous. As if it had no way of monitoring its ad program, and a Russian troll farm blasting propaganda were akin to finding a coin purse someone left under a cushion. Whoa! Who knew, or had any way of knowing? Well, Facebook did. \nPretending otherwise is fool's errand; no one could be that incompetent at running advertising and metrics and simultaneously have the entire industry in a chokehold. Blaming fake accounts \nFacebook is working hard and fast to minimize everything about this. \nFacebook's minimizing of the problem and pretending it's now fixed -- by deleting a few fake accounts -- is like minimizing gangrene. As if the accounts belonging to Putin's Internet Research Agency are a just tiny speck of bad actors and now they're gone, so phew, rest easy, everyone. \nThe primary talking point is that the accounts have been removed because, by gosh, they violated Facebook's rules. They \"misused the platform\" by making fake accounts. Not by actively working against the company's alleged values around diversity. Or by making racists more racist and fascists feel like they're so validated that stabbing immigrants to death or mowing anti-racism protesters down with a car is not just a good idea, but the right thing to do . \nFacebook said, \"We are exploring several new improvements to our systems for keeping inauthentic accounts and activity off our platform. For example, we are looking at how we can apply the techniques we developed for detecting fake accounts to better detect inauthentic Pages and the ads they may run.\" \nCool, so as long as the real accounts of people at Russian or any other propaganda factories are the ones running ads, it's all good? \nIn a way, you have to wonder at how Facebook can't just admit how toxic and monstrous and effective as a tool to manipulate people its advertising really is. Or that, thanks to all its talented engineers and skill at navigating big-picture trends to rake in billions, the company has a hell of a lot to do with why we're now a nation at war against itself -- neo-Nazis murdering people in the streets, immigrant children set for deportation by the hundreds of thousands, our country on the brink of nuclear war and more, so much more. \nLet's be honest: The trouble is that Facebook's ads are really effective. Those Facebook \"emotional contagion\" experiments to make people happy or sad and then to tell advertisers how to use it to make you do stuff, well, that was real -- and it worked. Foreign and domestic Trump campaigns \nWho else, besides Russian state operatives, was running ads about the same topics, at the exact same time? The Trump campaign. \nThere is a connection between Russian efforts to influence the election and Facebook-ad buys, just as there was the same connection with the Trump campaign, at the same time, with ad content covering the same issues in parallel -- race, immigration, LGBT rights and more. Facebook told The Washington Post that the Russian ads \"were directed at people on Facebook who had expressed interest in subjects explored on those pages, such as LGBT community, black social issues, the Second Amendment and immigration.\" \nThe Trump campaign's Facebook-ad strategy -- divisive race-fueled messaging on the social network -- was so highly successful that The New York Review of Books concluded , \"Donald Trump is our first Facebook president.\" \nDomestic Trump operatives started by purchasing $2 million in Facebook ads -- eventually ramping that up to $70 million a month, with most of it in Facebook ads. The New York Review of Books quotes Trump digital-team member Gary Coby telling Wired that \"on any given day ... the campaign was running 40,000 to 50,000 variants of its ads. ... On the day of the third presidential debate in October, the team ran 175,000 variations.\" \nNYRB detailed : \nHe then uploaded all known Trump supporters into the Facebook advertising platform and, using a Facebook tool called Custom Audiences from Customer Lists, matched actual supporters with their virtual doppelgangers and then, using another Facebook tool, parsed them by race, ethnicity, gender, location, and other identities and affinities. \nFrom there he used Facebook's Lookalike Audiences tool to find people with interests and qualities similar to those of his original cohort and developed ads based on those characteristics, which he tested using Facebook's Brand Lift surveys. \nTrump's team no doubt saw in Facebook's ad platform the same things that Putin's propaganda mill had already learned to love. It used Facebook's ad tools , refined at targeting those most vulnerable to suggestion, to influence those ripening under Facebook's own rules that coddle Holocaust denial, and anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment. \"They understood that some numbers matter more than others,\" NYRB explained. \"In this case, the number of angry, largely rural, disenfranchised potential Trump voters -- and that Facebook, especially, offered effective methods for pursuing and capturing them.\" \nIn light of this week's revelations, Trump's Facebook ads deserve a closer look. Like the one that intended to stir anger about mistreatment of US veterans -- but depicted Russian veterans . \nYou have to wonder how a mistake like that is made. It's easy to wonder if it was an ad made by a Russian house and its pool of files, where topics have stock images labeled by campaign, and if even more of the misapplied images in Trump's Facebook ads came from an organization that used the same ones for the same topics, too. \nIt's more urgent to know if it was an ad run by both foreign and domestic Trump Facebook ad campaigns, because that would surely be something. \nFacebook could tell us more about what was in those ads and when -- like if both the domestic Trump campaign and the Russian Trump campaign were coordinated in messaging -- but it won't. It could also tell us who was targeted with what, where, and when, but it hasn't. The \"tip of the iceberg\" \nOn Thursday, Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told press that Facebook's disclosure was just the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Warner reminded everyone that when Facebook was first called out on all this in late 2016 during the election, the social-media giant told us a very different story. Speaking Thursday at the Intelligence & National Security Summit in Washington, Warner said: \"The first reaction from Facebook was: 'Well you're crazy, there's nothing going on.' Well, we find yesterday there actually was something going on.\" \nIn this week's PR spin coming from Facebook, we're hearing a lot about fake accounts and false personas, and things that happen (parenthetically) outside Facebook. We're given the impression that Facebook has no accountability or role in this other than racing to the rescue to protect its users. The same users it sells out to Facebook's real customers: its advertisers. O,r more specifically, anyone with enough money to rank high in its class system of ad buyers. \n\"It's not my fault\" -- aka hiding behind \"we got rid of the fake accounts\" -- doesn't cut it anymore, and it actually never did. That's what we keep hearing neo-Nazis say to press when they march in American streets. They just showed up; we can't control who joins us; he acted alone; they were fake accounts; our ads don't really swing opinion into action. \nThese are things America's neo-Nazis say when members of their groups attack and kill innocent people in the name of racism, in the name of what we know was in those foreign and domestic Facebook ads served up to the very people who would be most receptive to them. People who, thanks to Facebook's fragmenting and dangerous \"filter bubbles\" and coddling of Holocaust denial , are retreating from meaningful debate and hunkering down into ideological bunkers. \nFacebook has a role in this, and it's ugly. Even as they dance around it and pretend there's no connection, or that what little it will admit to is somehow not a big deal. It's a huge deal. \nHow can Facebook truly combat this? Auditing and legitimate transparency would be a starting point. So, you know, don't hold your breath. \nIn an \" information operations update \" Thursday, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos wrote at length about fake accounts, trying harder to tie its advertising-propaganda problem to an abuse problem that is only peripherally related. \nStamos wrote: \"We have shared our findings with US authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary.\" \nAs necessary, indeed. \nWe have contacted Facebook for comment and will update this article in the event of a response. \nImages: REUTERS/Stephen Lam (Mark Zuckerberg); REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (Donald Trump); Steve Marcus / Reuters (Alex Stamos, Facebook CSO) By Violet Blue @violetblue \nMs. Violet Blue ( tinynibbles.com , @violetblue) is a the author of the forthcoming book How To Be A Digital Revolutionary .

      "text": "Following a vote on Friday by the Virginia State Board of Elections, the state will take decisive action to ensure the integrity of its voting machines. Virginia’s election supervisors have instructed 22 localities to abandon their existing machines immediately, citing risks inherent in the way they record votes.\n“The Department of Elections believes that the risks presented by using this equipment in the November General Election are sufficiently significant to warrant immediate decertification to ensure the continued integrity of Virginia elections,” Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés said in a memo accompanying the decision.\nNotably, the Virginia Department of Elections cited security research from the most recent DefCon in its decision:\n“As security threats against election systems have increased, the Department has grown more vigilant regarding potential threats against voting equipment. In this environment, DefCon, an annual conference of hackers, promoted the “Voting Machine Hacking Village” at which multiple voting machines, mostly DREs, were made available. Multiple types of DREs, some of which are currently in use in Virginia, were hacked according to public reports from DefCon.”\nThe central issue is that Virginia’s touchscreen equipment, known as direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines, did not produce a paper trail — one of the most robust if old-fashioned safeguards against potential vote tampering. Verified Voting , an organization that monitors voting equipment explains how these machines work:\n“… Using one of three basic interfaces (pushbutton, touchscreen or dial) voters record their votes directly into computer memory. The voter’s choices are stored in DREs via a memory cartridge, diskette or smart card and added to the choices of all other voters. An alphabetic keyboard is typically provided with the entry device to allow for the possibility of write-in votes, though with older models this is still done manually.\nDRE systems can be distinguished generally by the interface through which the voter indicate her selections… Some DREs can be equipped with Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) printers that allow the voter to confirm their selections on an independent paper record before recording their votes into computer memory.”\nBecause they can’t be checked against a paper record, these voting systems make it almost impossible to detect suspicious activity. As the description above notes, some DRE machines are paired with an additional device that can record votes to paper, but Virginia’s systems did not have this additional security measure.\nThe decision comes in time to secure the state’s voting systems before its upcoming state and governor’s races on November 7.\nFeatured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch 0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "Tons of features of iPhone 8, iPhone X detailed in leaked iOS 11 build Posted Linxo raises $24 million for its app that brings bank accounts together Another iPhone 8 leak ahead of Apple’s fall event next Tuesday when it’s official expected to unveil its new flagships: 9to5Mac has been digging through the Golden Master build of iOS 11, and pulled out a few new nuggets of intel about the incoming top of the range iPhone (code-named D22). \nWe’ve also confirmed with a source that the firmware release being looked at here is the real-deal. \nThe biggest leak might well be the names of the new devices , which include iPhone 8 and iPhone X. iPhone 8 \n— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 9, 2017 \nOne incoming feature that could prove popular with iPhone users — especially if it’s not limited to only the very top-of-the-range iPhone model — are animated, 3D emoji characters for iMessage which it says are called Animoji (these are referred to as Jellyfish in iOS 11 release). Including an incoming animated poo-moji, pictured in still 3D form above. \nThere’s also a GIF of a few others in action… \nIt says the Animoji will use facial tracking and the user’s voice to create expressive animated messages. So augmented emoji messaging here we come. \n9to5Mac has also unearthed a bunch of new and rather retrotastic-looking still wallpapers incoming — and for a couple of these Apple appears to be getting perilously close to recreating the ZX Spectrum logo. \nI mean, spot the difference… \nIncoming iOS 11 wallpaper: \nYe olde ZX Spectrum logos (as seen via a Google search): \n[Insert: Thinking emoji face right here… ] \nMoving on, a camera-related feature apparently coming to the new premium priced iPhone model is a Portrait Lighting mode for creating “dSLR-like shots”, as 9to5Mac terms it, using depth by simulating different lighting effects. \n9to5Mac notes there’s support for Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light, Stage Light Mono, and Studio Light evident in the leaked build, and suggests the mode enhancement could be related to the flash when shooting. \nIt’s also found new video recording resolutions and capture speeds: \n1080p HD at 240 fps480 MB with 1080p HD at 240 fps \n4K at 24 fps(Footer) 270 MB with 4K at 24 fps (film style)(HEVC Footer) 135 MB with 4K at 24 fps (film style) \n4K at 60 fps(Footer) 450 MB with 4K at 60 fps (higher resolution, smoother)(HEVC Footer) 400 MB with 4K at 60 fps (higher resolution, smoother) \nPer prior rumors , the iPhone 8 is expected to see Apple switch from LCD displays to OLED — and 9to5Mac says it’s seeing evidence the OLED iPhone will feature a True Tone Display for white balancing like the iPad Pro lineup. While it reckons the new resolution will be 1125×2436 based on this firmware. \nThe firmware also includes further references to the new iPhone screen design with the distinctive top notch — first revealed back in July , via the release of firmware for Apple’s forthcoming HomePod Siri speaker. \nOne of these new reference images apparently shows an SOS mode that can be triggered by pressing what looks like the power and upper volume keys on either side of the iPhone at the same time. \nIt says there’s also a clue that the power button will play a larger role for interacting with iOS now that Apple is ditching the home button on the OLED iPhone — per earlier rumors . \nSo, for example, double-clicking the side button (as this key is now apparently being called) will show Apple Pay cards and passes, as is the case on the Apple Watch. 9to5Mac says you can also press and hold it to invoke Siri. Which does make me wonder whether you’ll have to talk to Siri every time you want to turn your top-of-the-range iPhone off. \nThe side button method is also apparently tied to new Accessibility settings for adjusting the speed of the double and triple click, enabling Type to Siri, and even using Face ID (more on the latter below). \nInstead of a home button at the base of the screen, the new premium iPhone 8 is also rumored to be getting a dynamic area/status bar at the bottom of its near bezel-less display. \nAnd this firmware leak appears to confirm the change — with this region being denoted by a line at the bottom of apps: \n\nThe earlier HomePod speaker firmware leak also confirmed rumors that Cupertino is bringing a facial recognition feature for unlocking the device to the iPhone 8. \nNow, 9to5Mac has found a video tutorial for setting up the face unlock feature, which appears to show that users will be guided through capturing their visage — starting with a full frontal and then tilting to the sides, up around and down… \nIt reckons the face unlock feature, which is codenamed Pearl ID in the leaked firmware, will be officially called Face ID in Apple’s marketing. LTE Apple Watch, AirPod tweaks \nLast but not least: As well as iPhone tidbids, 9to5Mac says the iOS 11 GM has leaked what looks to be an image of the new LTE Apple Watch Series 3 , which sports a red spot on the digital crown — presumably to help it stand out from existing, non-cellular Apple Watch models. \nFor further proof, it’s also found a watchOS screenshot of Control Center with a cellular signal indicator (as well as the ‘notch’ OLED iPhone icon). \nOther references suggest the watch will share the same phone number as the connected iPhone, as you’d expect. And there are indications some carriers intend to offer promotional plans for the device. \nElsewhere on the other hardware front, 9to5Mac has unearthed what it reckons is a minor tweak coming to AirPods, with a revised version number (1.1 to 1.2) and a video suggesting Apple is moving the charging indicator light from insight to the front of the device so you don’t have to pop it open to check if your earbuds are juiced up yet. \nIt says it’s still digging through the firmware so may have more tidbits to detail. Although iPhone fans don’t have long to wait for the real-deal big reveal. And of course TechCrunch will be on the ground in Cupertino on Tuesday to bring you all the news as we get it.

      "text": "Francisco Coronel Contributor Francisco Coronel is a founding partner at NXTP Labs , an early-stage fund for tech companies in Latin America.\nWhen a company expands to Latin America, it requires a great deal of effort to adapt the language, operations and marketing strategies in order to find acceptance in the local market. In Spanish, the process of adapting a product or service to the local market is called “ tropicalización ,” or tropicalization.\nBecause tropicalization is often a significant undertaking, there are countless business models in the United States and other English-speaking markets that have not yet been fully implemented in Latin America, leaving real opportunities for startups in the region. In fact, up until now, a majority of the most successful startups coming out of Latin America have fallen under the “copycat” business model. In other words, local entrepreneurs have been the ones replicating successful business models crafted by U.S. startups and launching them locally. A few examples include MercadoLibre — the “eBay,” OLX — the “Craigslist” and Despegar — the “Expedia.”\nThe “copycat” business model has some favorable attributes. For one, startups can easily explain their concept to local investors using the well-known “Uber for X” phrasing, allowing investors to quickly identify the problem and understand how this could be a notable solution. This tends to make securing investments in a traditionally risk-adverse region a whole lot easier.\nOn the other hand, there’s been a rise in truly disruptive ideas coming out of Latin America, as well. Before going into which business model is more advantageous in the region, it is also important to point out the difference between “innovation” and “disruption.”\nCertainly, “copycat” startups can be innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors. After all, implementing an existing business model for a local market does require creativity and a serious commitment, but true disruption uproots everything consumers currently understand, how they behave and how they do business.\nAccording to Harvard Business School professor and disruption guru Clayton Christensen , “disruption displaces an existing market, industry, or technology and produces something new and more efficient and worthwhile. It is at once destructive and creative.”\nIt’s worth exploring which model has been more effective in Latin America and in which way will startups continue to progress. Will they continue reshaping known business models for the Latin American market? Or, are we witnessing a steady influx of ideas that are entirely brand new? To answer that question, it’s important to first explore some of the startups born from each approach, and what the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are for entrepreneurs in Latin America.\nCopycat successes in Latin America The risk-averse nature of investors in Latin America has a lot to do with why so many VCs have felt much more confident investing in ideas that mimic successful companies in the U.S. or Europe. However, as the saying goes, an idea alone is not always the key to success; what matters is execution.\nReplicating an existing business model can be extremely challenging in a complex region like Latin America. In some cases, startups find adapting relatively easy. However, most of the time it can be a tough path. Nicolas Szekasy , an investor and board member of Restorando , Latin America’s “OpenTable,” argues that most copycats in the region are simply variations using the same technology. He goes on to say, “that if the companies initially appear to be copycats of their U.S. counterparts, they often adapt and adjust along the way to successfully serve the local market, and ultimately end up with very different business models.”\nTrue disruption uproots everything consumers currently understand, how they behave and how they do business.\nThe true definition of a “copycat” is still very much open to interpretation. However, what really matters is that this approach does have its advantages, and, many times, Latin American startups are implementing existing ideas in a better way — or creating more value than how the original model was designed.\nTake Brazil’s Dafiti , for example. Now part of Berlin-based Rocket Internet , which is famous for applying proven ideas in other countries in emerging markets, Dafiti based its original business model off of U.S.-based Zappos and tailored the business model to fit the Latin American market. In doing so, it became quite successful in the region and joined Rocket Internet’s global fashion group, which is now valued at $1.1 billion .\nBrazilian technology-powered freight broker CargoX also found considerable success with its “Uber for trucking” business model. Brazil reportedly has an excess of between 300,000 and 350,000 vehicles , with trucks running empty 40 percent of the time. The goal of CargoX is to reduce the number of empty trucks on the highway, increase revenue for truckers and reduce costs for freight owners.\nBetween its launch in 2013 and last year, CargoX added 100,000 members, equivalent to 10 percent of self-employed truck drivers in Brazil. In a single day, the company once registered 5,000 downloads , according to the company’s CEO, Argentine Federico Vega. Fast-forward to today, and CargoX has raised an additional $10 million in Series B funding from Goldman Sachs, established a network of more than 150,000 trucks and has laid the foundation for a sustainable transportation company with great potential for expansion throughout the rest of the region.\nA few other examples of the applied business model, or “copycat” successes in the region include:\nProperati , the real estate marketplace of Latin America, operates much like Zillow in the U.S., working with 10,000+ realtors . It has more than 1 million properties published in Brazil and almost 2 million total in Latin America, covering a significant portion of the real estate market in the region. Adapting the business model of Shopify, TiendaNube is another admirable example. As the region’s first web-based, iOS and Android app for e-commerce store management for small and medium-sized businesses, TiendaNube has attracted more than 400,000 stores to launch on its platform since it started almost seven years ago. TiendaNube stores are generating an annual revenue of more than $62 million USD . In today’s digital age, ideas can travel much faster than companies can. Nonetheless, what matters most is the execution of those ideas. In many of the above cases, the “copycat” approach has its definite advantages. These Latin American entrepreneurs are well aware that with the right strategies in place, they can adapt profitable business models from the U.S. and Europe to the local market and grow them quickly — with expansion and exit strategies already in place.\nThe disruptors in Latin America Even though there are plenty of inspiring “copycat” startups in Latin America upheld by innovative founders, high valuations and millions of users, this way of thinking is not without its criticisms.\nDuring the last decade, many involved in the Latin American ecosystem have pointed out that simply copying what U.S. and European startups are doing is no longer a sustainable model. In Latin America, the majority of entrepreneurs and investors have become far too comfortable with this strategy, always looking for easy wins. However, if the region is going to partake in global innovation, then entrepreneurs and investors must start focusing more on real disruption.\nThe good news is that there are fewer and fewer copycats, as Latin America’s entrepreneurs are becoming much more aware that they must compete globally. Startups like Satellogic are evidence of this shift in thinking. The company is on a mission to develop commercial-grade satellites at an extremely low cost, for less than $100,000. The founder and CEO, Argentine Emiliano Kargieman , is a hacker at heart, with years of experience in the technology landscape.\nSatellogic is planning to launch a constellation of nanosatellites into orbit that will generate real-time images from all over the planet  —  an incredibly valuable asset for hundreds of industries. No company has attempted this before, and Satellogic’s approach has the potential to truly disrupt the satellite data market.\nEven though a disruptive approach tends to be more capital-intensive, it’s usually from this side that the world’s most visionary leaders are born.\nThere are plenty of other disruptors emerging in Latin America. In fact, these companies can already be counted by the thousands and are spreading beyond the internet into new sectors like agtech, clean energy, biotechnology, digital medicine, renewable energy, software security, IoT and AI. “Latin America is witnessing the emergence and growth of a new species of companies that is transforming our business landscape,” a new report on Tecnolatinas (technology-based private companies born in the region) states. “And most of these Tecnolatinas are entrepreneur-driven, digital ventures with an international footprint.”\nSemtive , founded by a team of Argentines, is producing turbines designed for low wind speeds — unlike traditional wind farms that rely on speeds of 30 mph or greater . With the smallest model starting at $4,600 USD , the startup hopes to become the first and most affordable small wind turbine on the market for homes and businesses.\nThe Latin American agricultural technology market is expected to reach $541.8 million by 2022, and BovControl is another company disrupting “business as usual” by supporting efficient farm production using data collection techniques, cloud computing and information delivery. Founded in Brazil, where there are more cows than people, BovControl is now used on thousands of farms across the world.\nWhich approach is more effective in Latin America? To draw a conclusion as to which approach is better for startups in Latin America, it strongly depends on the definition of success being used. For example, success could be based on the total funding companies have raised using each approach. In this case, one could look at the most recent Latin American Venture Capital Trend Watch Report by LAVCA, which describes the top 10 venture capital deals made in 2016. Of the 10 largest deals, the majority were made in companies whose businesses appear to mimic existing models in the U.S., such as Square, Lending Club and Postmates.\nIf the definition of success is an acquisition, then of the dozen or so Latin American startups listed here that have been acquired by companies abroad since 2013, three-to-four companies could be considered truly disruptive. The other nine or more used an applied business model approach and were acquired by similar services abroad as a strategic entrance into the region.\nAnd finally, one of the more conventional ways to measure startup success is to examine valuations. Of the nine Latin American companies currently in the billion-dollar club, three are clearly using an applied business model approach and six have developed disruptive solutions.\nIt is possible to draw conclusions based on the data above, but for the most part, it remains to be seen which business model is producing the most startup successes in Latin America as the ecosystem is still relatively young when compared to other more mature ecosystems. Additionally, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages when applied in Latin America. The “copycat,” or applied business model approach, can be used to fulfill unmet needs in an existing category. For the most part, it also tends to be faster and cheaper. However, execution is key and speed matters, as companies who opt for this route often face a lot more competition.\nThe innovative, disruptor approach has its unique advantages in that companies can create their own category, and, therefore, are faced with less competition. And even though a disruptive approach tends to be more capital-intensive, it’s usually from this side that the world’s most visionary leaders are born. As someone who has invested in companies on both sides of the table, I can confidently say that Latin America is filled with incredibly innovative entrepreneurs creating real solutions to real problems in Latin America — and they are doing so by any means possible.\nFull disclosure: My firm, NXTP Labs, is an investor in CargoX, Properati, TiendaNube, Satellogic and Semtive.\n ",

      "text": "YouTube brings playback speed choices to mobile The feature is now live on iOS and Android. Save Engadget/Richard Lai \nThe ability to choose playback speeds on YouTube can be pretty valuable. You can use it, say, whenever you need to see what's going on in a tutorial in slow motion or just want to speed watch a random vlog. Now the feature has finally made its way to the platform's iOS and Android apps, so you don't have to fire up your laptop just so you can slow down or speed up what you're watching. \nIn his announcement post, YouTube Software Engineer Pallavi Powale said they had to overcome some engineering hurdles to make the update happen. They had to make sure that the app can change the duration of the audio without affecting its quality. As you know, playing videos faster could make voices sound like chipmunks, while playing them at a slower speed could lower the pitch. The team had to do the same thing for the desktop version, but the problem with mobile is that phones are subject to hardware and network limitations. That's why when you change the playback speed on your phone, YouTube adjusts the video quality \"to be only as high as [the app] can download dependably.\" \nThe feature is already live for a lot of people -- to try it out, simply tap on the hamburger menu at the top of the app's interface. After that, choose \"Playback Speed\" from the menu that pops up and choose the speed you prefer.",

      "text": "Twitter has an unlaunched tweetstorm feature Posted Don’t count on any Apple fireworks on Wall Street next week Subverting the 140 character limit by chaining tweets together into a cohesive “tweetstorm” takes some know-how, or you’ll screw it up. Luckily Twitter has built but not yet launched a feature for easily composing tweetstorms. Hidden inside the current Android app is a way to write out a tweetstorm and see it broken into distinct tweets, then tweet them all at once. \nBy institutionalizing tweetstorms with a graphic user interface, Twitter could make sharing expanded thoughts more accessible to everyone. Whether it’s telling a suspenseful story, stringing together breaking news facts, or going on a long-winded rant that should have been a blog post, tweetstorms let you distribute deeper and more nuanced content. \nUnder the pseudonym Devesh Logendran, a Twitter user passed on their sighting of the tweetstorm feature to TNW’s Director of social media Matt Navarra . Twitter told us “No comment to share on the record” when we asked about the feature that refers to tweetstorms as “threads”. We have no additional information on if or when this feature will ever launch, but have learned that it’s not currently available for public testing. \nPopularized by tech investor Marc Andreessen, coined by fellow VC Chris Dixon, and vilified by BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel , tweetstorms have been a Twitter power user trick since at least 2014. \nTypically, you need to know to reply to you previous tweet one at a time to build a tweetstorm, not just tweet separately or reply the first tweet. A lot of people make these mistakes, causing their storms to get broken up in the timeline. \nWhether making tweetstorms easier is good for the information density and consumption trends of Twitter is up for debate. \nSome think you should either condense your thoughts into a tweet or two, or right a separate blog post and link to it. Others think the serialized format can offer a special reading experience and reach a wider audience than an offsite blog. Either way, the Twitter sorting algorithm deemphasizes content with weak feedback, so if tweetstormers are boring their audience, they’ll pay the price in visibility. \nBut one of Twitter’s core problems is that it doesn’t feel approachable for the average joes and janes, leading to its weak user growth the last few years. Seeing tweetstorms and not understanding how they work, or messing up when you try yourself can discourage people from sticking with the app. \nTwitter’s already made a wise push to simplify itself in other ways, like dropping media embeds or usernames in replies from the character count. Launching a tweetstorm button could remove one more confusing block from the wall dividing Twitter from the mainstream. 0 ",

      "text": "540 shares \nIn my 25 years in creative industries, the way we have worked has never felt right. Like some kind of industrial revolution hangover — a time when work was boring, uncomfortable and dangerous — it appears people still need to be coerced with carrots and sticks into being productive. \nEven in 2017 the starting point for employers still sounds most often like: “you don’t enjoy working, so I’m going to make you. And to make sure I can make you, I’m going to make you come to this same place at this same time every day”. \nBut having an aversion to work has never been my impression of working with creative people. Like myself, they all seem to enjoy the challenges thrown at them, enjoy solving problems, enjoy crafting a design or piece of copy. They enjoy their work and resent being made to feel like they don’t. \nSo I’ve often wondered how much more productive we might be if we were managed by people who enabled, rather than coerced us; who trusted our innate ambition to succeed, and gave us the freedom to work in ways that individually suited us. \nWell things definitely seem to be changing, and some companies in certain industries (LEGO, Netflix, Zappos) have tried mixing things up with greater or lesser success. But not in our industry — and for an industry that sells itself as innovative, creative and progressive — this simply won’t do. \nWhich is why I was so excited when ten months ago I decided to start my own branding agency with my business partners. I had certainly read ample theory on the subject of creating progressive cultures over the years, and even dabbled in building them within my own teams while working for the big boys (well, as much as they would allow) but now I could finally put everything into practice for myself — proper and good. \nStarting our business with the single question: “How do we succeed in an industry that is failing?”, we spent our first three months speaking with agency owners, clients, agency employees and freelancers, trying to see if there were better ways of doing things, and so solve the problems of our own industry. \nThis culminated in launching an outsource-model virtual collaborative of brand thinkers and creative problem-solvers, fundamentally based on the principle that if people can operate in ways individually tailored to them, if they are encouraged to achieve balance in their lives around their job, family, health and play, if they are able to work without distraction at home (while seamlessly joined up online) then they will ultimately be more productive and so do better work, more efficiently. \nTo further fly in the face of industry convention, we chose also to only measure collaborators on output, rather than hours, and our clients would pay for the same (shock and horror, I know). \nOne thing our clients certainly wouldn’t have to pay for would be all the major overheads of a traditional agency, with their swanky offices and unutilised human resources in times of quiet. Having only a few full-time staff, our agency model would mean that clients would only pay for the resources they needed, when they needed them. And these resources, in turn, would be selected on a job-by-job or client-by-client basis from a global talent pool of specialists, rather than simply from the generalists available in our studio. \nAgain, all of this contradicts traditional agency thinking, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and don’t be fooled — things in our industry are pretty desperate right now. After decades of discontent, clients are still complaining about decreases in value and quality, agencies bemoaning shrinking pots of revenue, and employees working themselves into the ground without so much as overtime pay or even a Christmas bonus. \nAnyway, it’s been six months since we opened our doors (of which we have none, to be fair) and with large projects under our belt now on two major international brands, I am here to report on how this great experiment is working out. \nPersonally, I am certainly highly productive at the minute (‘productivity’ I define simply as ‘inspiration with discipline’). I find myself working more often in places and ways that fuel me, while not being subject to a ‘distraction factory’ (as the founders of Basecamp like to call the modern office environment). This means I am doing some of the best work of my life, while I feel happier, healthier and freer than I have in years (maybe all 45 of them). \nAnd what of our collaborators — are they experiencing a difference? \nBelieving that the people who work for us should be able to do so from anywhere in the world means that one of our collaborators can fulfil her dreams of travelling while earning. For us, we’re excited that she will connect with different cultures — broadening her experiences, deepening her empathy, and potentially encouraging her to think more openly about brand challenges and solutions. \nWe also have a plan to embed other willing collaborators like her in project hot-spots, giving them the opportunity to live in a given market whilst carrying out certain assignments at the coal face with our clients. This idea helps us explore new ways of offering better thinking and service, while collaborators that are interested get to explore the planet. \nOf course, travel is only one ambition collaborators may have outside of work, and we are attempting to work with each individual collaborator in individual ways that are mutually beneficial. Each relationship will be its own unique experiment, but why not — we’re designers, aren’t we? \nThe common idea is that the more balanced and rounded and inspired and experienced we all are, the better we’ll be at our work. Also that our method allows each of us the prospect of working alongside the best design practitioners in the world, not just the best in our office. \nAll in, this leaves collaborators feeling more balanced, more in touch and more productive — but has it translated into better work? Surely our clients — of everyone — should prosper from our new openness. \nWell a fit-for-purpose, built-on-demand team of specialists allows for maximum output with agility and flexibility, so we can all work more easily toward extremely challenging deadlines — better — and at a lower price point. We’ve proven it. \nAlthough we can’t blow our own trumpet in this public forum, we’ve already been told on more than one occasion by different multinational clients that ours is ‘some of the best work we’ve ever seen’, and in ‘miraculous timeframes’. \nIt seems the work we are producing is living up to its promise, and that can only really be as the result of working differently and attracting better people by working differently — in ways that people work best, and in ways they enjoy. Of course, this challenges the old school thinkers (if they’re thinking at all) who say if you leave people to their own devices nothing ever gets done, and that you can’t do good creative work unless you’re all sitting physically together in the same room. \nIt’s early days and we don’t claim to have all the answers, but at least we are willing to explore a few new ones and appear to be heading in the right direction. At least we are proving you can build your work around your life, rather than your life around your work. And at least we have our lives back.",

      "text": "Spotify no longer streams music in Apple's Safari web browser You'll have to fire up an alternative or the app to keep listening. Save AOL \nIf you use Safari to stream Spotify tunes, you're going to need a plan B. Listeners have discovered that Spotify's web player no longer works with Safari. Visit and you'll be asked to either use an alternative browser or fire up the native Mac app. When asked about the abrupt change, the company's customer support could only say that \"recent updates\" made Safari incompatible. It can't say if or when the feature will come back. We've asked Spotify if it can elaborate, but there's already some speculation as to the possible cause. \nMac Generation suspects that the decision might have something to do with the Widevine copy protection plugin. Spotify wants to use that for web-based music streaming, but macOS may flag it over concerns that its security isn't sufficiently airtight. And without reliable access to Widevine, Spotify can't guarantee that Safari will play properly even if it's technically possible. \nThis isn't likely to be a huge issue on the Mac, since it doesn't take much to fire up another app. However, this could be a headache if you use a Mac at work and aren't allowed to install your own software. Also, it illustrates one of the perils of copy protection on the web : it turns an ostensibly universal platform into a proprietary one where you have to support a given company's add-ons to get the full experience.",

      "text": "Binge-Watch Every Apple iPhone Announcement Right Here Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Apple is set to announce its next iPhone on Tuesday, and it's going to be an important milestone. This year marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple's smartphone, and rumors all point to a radical new model that packs an edge-to-edge screen, an all new design, and some nifty AR features. Those are all rumors, though. You can count on Tim Cook calling this the Best iPhone Ever Made, but don't take his word for it. Go back and watch all of the past iPhone events to see what's changed since 2007. The Original, From 2007 Watch Jony Ive and Phil Schiller fight over whose flip phone Steve Jobs should call from Apple's first smartphone. The iPhone 3G, From 2008 Alongside the launch of the iPhone 3G came the App Store, which brought you all your favorite apps like I Am T-Pain , Crazy Mouth , and I Am Rich . The iPhone 3GS, From 2009 Here, you can see the beginning of what would ultimately become Siri , your lovable pal who probably still Can't Answer That. The iPhone 4, From 2010 It would have been the most shocking iPhone release up to that point, had it not been for a young Apple software engineer getting too lit and leaving his iPhone 4 on a barstool. That iPhone 4 made its way to Gizmodo, who leaked the company's upcoming device ahead of the announcement, shattering the buzz of the first glass-backed iPhone. The iPhone 4S, From 2011 In Tim Cook's first iPhone announcement, Siri stole the show. Unfortunately, we still have a hard time getting Siri to do anything past set an alarm. Here's to a better Siri this year. The iPhone 5, From 2012 After years of sticking to a 3.5-inch screen, Apple changed it up by giving the iPhone 5 a 4-inch screen, plus snappy LTE speeds to download that new Angry Birds update. The iPhone 5s, From 2013 Passcodes took a backseat in 2013 to make way for Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint-sensing technology that made it harder for prying eyes to see who's been sliding into your DMs. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, From 2014 They were bigger and faster than any other iPhone, and a little more bendy just for yuks. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, From 2015 This was mostly just a spec bump, but the cameras got better and 3D Touch turned anything on the screen into a new type of button that added extra depth to iOS's interface. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, From 2016 By now you probably know that all the buzz around the iPhone 7 focused on the loss of the beloved headphone jack. But there were some other notable changes in last year's iPhone, like a water-resistant design, a capacitive home button, stereo speakers, and a makeover that hid those antenna lines. The iPhone's Whole History in One Video Get excited for Tuesday! ",

      "text": "EU countries aim to raise tech firms' taxes by targeting revenue Amazon, Google and others could pay a lot more in the EU. Save Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images \nIt's no secret that European countries want major tech firms to pay more taxes , but how will they go about that beyond collecting back taxes ? By taxing the companies where they'll feel it the most, that's how. The finance ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Spain have written a joint letter to the European Union's presidency and Commission calling for taxes on tech giants' revenues, not just their profits. The four nations want the Commission to produce an \"equalization tax\" that would make companies pay the equivalent of the corporate tax in the countries where they earn revenue. \nThe ministers want to put the issue on the table for an EU meeting in Estonia (where the current presidency is located) on September 15th. It's not certain how other EU members will react, but the presidency has already scheduled a talk about making it possible to tax companies wherever they produce value. Google recently dodged a tax bullet in France because its operations are based in Ireland, and it's clear that the countries want to eliminate that technicality going forward. \nIt's safe to say that Google, Amazon, Apple and other similarly large companies will fight tooth and nail if the letter turns into definitive action. These frequently base their operations in countries with strong tax incentives, like Ireland, to dramatically reduce the taxes they pay in Europe and beyond. If they had to pay more typical taxes in all EU member states, they might pay billions more every year.",

      "text": "10:00 am Security News This Week: Germany's Election Software Is Dangerously Hackable German flags fly over the Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag, on September 4, 2017 in Berlin. Germany is scheduled to hold federal elections on September 24. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Another week, another revelation of a massive breach with potentially far-reaching consequences. Well, two of those this week, actually. First, Symantec revealed that hackers—probably based in Russia, although the security firm didn't go so far as to name names—had hacked more than 20 power companies in North America and Europe , and in a handful of cases, had direct access to their control systems. And then Equifax confessed it had been the target of a breach that stole 143 million Americans' data, one of the worst data spills ever, and one that raises questions about data centralization, particularly for Social Security Numbers . Megabreaches aside, Facebook admitted that a Russian troll farm had spent $100,000 on influence ads during last year's election. Google patched a flaw in Android that would allow a nasty \"toast overlay\" attack to take control of devices. WIRED dug into the long-running series of scams and theft plaguing new currencies in the cryptocoin economy . And we spoke to the Democratic National Committee's chief technology officer about how he hopes to prevent the next attack aimed at disemboweling the party. And there’s more. As always, we’ve rounded up all the news we didn’t break or cover in depth this week. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. Researchers Uncover Serious Holes in Germany's Voting Software After hackers believed to be Russian meddled in both the US and French elections, Germany is likely next on the target list. And this week the Chaos Computer Club, a German collective of hackers and security researchers, exposed the results of their unsolicited audit of the country's voting infrastructure. They found that a program called PC-Wahl, used for recording, counting, displaying, and analyzing votes in German elections from the local level to the national government. The hackers found they could corrupt the updates from the server controlling that software to re-tabulate votes at will, with potentially disastrous consequences for the country's October parliamentary election. The CCC says that VOTE-IT, the company behind the software, privately fixed the security flaws the group exposed while publicly refusing to acknowledge the vulnerabilities. Ultrasonic Voice Commands Can Hijack Siri and Amazon Echos These days, it's not just politicians who can use \"dog-whistles\" to send messages intended only for a very particular audience. So can hackers. Researchers at the University of Zhejiang have shown that they can send ultrasonic signals to voice assistants like your iPhone's Siri, Amazon's Echo, Google Now, and even the voice command systems of an Audi car that are inaudible to humans, but nonetheless picked up and obeyed by those systems. Their technique, which they call DolphinAttack, can be achieved with just a few dollars of equipment like an ultrasonic transducer and a battery, as well as a smartphone, and could allow hackers to silently \"speak\" to nearby devices and cause them to visit malware-infected websites, make calls that stream audio for surveillance purposes, or other mischief. And since the attack takes advantage of physical properties of the microphone that cause it to pick up commands from ultrasonic waves, there's no easy fix for the problem. Critical Bug in Open-Source Framework Could Endanger Corporate Data A bug announced this week in the Apache Struts web application software could allow attackers to take over servers running applications built with the framework, enabling the intruders to steal or manipulate sensitive data. The bug is now patched, but is significant because many organizations and Fortune 100 companies run and rely on affected applications. The vulnerability specifically impacts an Apache Struts plugin called REST that has been around since 2008. Vulnerable systems are everywhere, from public-facing platforms for banking and reservations to back-end software within a company, and researchers say exploiting the bug is simple using a web browser. They hadn't seen evidence that the bug was exploited before their announcement, but stressed how important it is for organizations to patch and monitor their systems. Resumes of Military and Intelligence Personnel Discovered in Unsecured S3 Bucket Roughly 9,400 sensitive resumes, many from US veterans, were found accessible and exposed in a recruiting firm's Amazon Web Services server, according to Chris Vickery and other researchers at the UpGuard security firm. The resumes date back to 2008 and were from applicants applying to work for the private security group TigerSwan, which contracted with the third party TalentPen until February. Some of the applicants claimed in their resumes to have US government top secret clearance, and many detailed sensitive military and intelligence work. The documents also naturally included personal information like email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and even passport numbers and partial social security numbers. Some of the submissions were from Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with US organizations. \"While criminals could use the deep knowledge of work experience and personal details ... the value of this database to foreign intelligence agencies if they were to access it is not insignificant,\" UpGuard noted. Widespread Protests Criticizing Togolese Government Prompt Telecommunications Blackouts Beginning on Tuesday, internet users in Togo began reporting slow or inaccessible internet and wireless connections, and lost access to communication platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and even SMS text messaging over cell networks. The country was experiencing widespread blackouts by Thursday, and some residents traveled to Togo's borders looking for connectivity leaking in from neighboring countries. The West African NGO Internet Without Borders and the internet infrastructure company Dyn both confirmed local reports. The blackouts are in response to extensive protests demanding Togolese President Faure Gnassingbé's resignation. Governments in countries like Gabon and Cameroon have used similar repression tactics to attempt to quiet dissent. Related Video Security Worried About Your Weak Passwords?

      "text": "Don’t count on any Apple fireworks on Wall Street next week Posted Why LA 2028 will be the first truly digital Olympic Games Barring Apple coming out with a delayed launch date for the next-generation iPhone, the guts of which are basically laid out on the Internet already , Apple’s shares are probably not going to see the kinds of explosive activity you might expect around something as hyped as a massive iPhone revision. \nInstead, Wall Street — which has spent months and months modeling Apple’s future, reading the tea leaves, and trying to chase down as many leads as it can — is walking into the event on Tuesday with as much of a good idea as the average consumer that reads, say, TechCrunch . Since these expectations are set, there typically aren’t any real surprises Apple could come out with that would force Wall Street to reassess the future of the company, and thus send the stock swinging upward or downward. \nThis is actually one of Apple’s biggest challenges and, in recent quarters, is often cited on conference calls for the companies’ quarterly earnings reports. Leaks for the next-generation iPhone are more prolific than ever. Given that the upcoming iPhone may end up having significant updates and changes, it would make sense that it would generate enough of a hype aura to get people to hold off on purchasing phones in the near term. \nStill, just by reviewing what’s happened in recent years, you don’t see any significant stock swings following each event. Let’s go back through some of the previous years, starting with the 2013 iPhone 5S announcement: \nThe iPhone 5S was an incremental update to the iPhone 5 and, as we’ve come to expect, we knew a lot about the phone before Tim Cook actually went on stage and kicked off the event to unveil the phone. Now, let’s take a look at 2014, the last massive revision to the iPhone: \nAnd then 2015, the incremental update to the iPhone 6 with the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus: \nAnd, finally, here’s last year’s launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: \nThe trend is normally pretty similar: there might be a small shift on the actual day of the event of a few percentage points, which is maybe followed by an extended euphoria period as Wall Street starts to come in with estimates of iPhone sales and their projections for the third quarter. Then, there’s a bit of a hangover period as the company starts to march toward its earnings report, which is typically where the real fireworks happen. \nThis is more or less a similar sentiment to what Wall Street has, which is tracking the same reports and is looking at the same tea leaves the average consumer is in order to divine where to value Apple as it heads into the fourth quarter. But in this case, the surprise last quarter was that Apple forecast a quarter that was a bit above what everyone expected — and, hence, would theoretically deliver the new iPhone on time. \nThat’s why the release date is going to be critical for the iPhone. Apple came out with some numbers that made Wall Street rethink what the company is going to do in the third quarter and the kind of results they expect to see. If that ends up not fitting the model, then they have to change the model, and then we’ll see a shift. \nThat’s now baked into the anticipation around the Apple event. New cameras are great, faster processors are also nice, but at this moment it seems there are few surprises that might come out about the actual guts of the device. Instead, most eyes will be on that date that Apple puts on screen for when consumers can finally begin ordering the new iPhone, and when it will begin shipping. \nApple had to constantly grapple with intense consumer demand for Plus models of the iPhone as consumer demand for larger phones seemed to far outstrip what everyone thought. Every week the shipments get pushed back is another week that consumers are going to have to wait, and it’s another week that the price tag will seem even more ominous if it ends up higher than what they are typically paying when they purchase a new iPhone. \nSo, don’t hold your breath for anything other than the final launch date (and maybe the price) of the iPhone X if you’re looking for something insane to happen on Wall Street. See y’all on Tuesday! Featured Image: BERND THISSEN/AFP/Getty Images 0",

      "text": "With new Managing Director, Ghana’s MEST scales as Pan-African incubator Posted New Uber CEO departs New York Times board Jake Bright Contributor Jake Bright is a writer and author in New York City. He is co-author of The Next Africa . More posts by this contributor: eBay opens U.S. platform to Africa with MallforAfrica.com partnership The MEST incubator has appointed Aaron Fu as its new Managing Director. This comes as the Accra based innovation hub scales up its presence across Africa. \nFounded in 2008, MEST operates as a training program and seed fund for African innovators to build successful commercial tech companies. \nFu takes the helm after two years as Managing Partner at early stage VC firm Nest. He also co-founded Metta Kenya , a Nest backed space in Nairobi for tech entrepreneurs and investors. Interim MEST MD Katie Sarro will shift to Head of Partnerships and Fundraising. \nFu plans to focus on the incubator’s continued expansion. “A very big part of that is figuring out what elements we’ve rolled out in Accra that will scale to the rest of the market,” he told TechCrunch. “As the organization transitions to becoming a multi-country entity, there’s going to be some organizational changes…to make sure MEST’s impact also scales.” \nThe incubator currently has offices or on ground presence in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. It actively recruits in those countries and Cote d’Ivoire. MEST is in the process of opening physical incubator spaces in multiple countries. \n“We want to connect our…startups to markets, resources customers, and teams from all across Africa to make their dream of building truly pan African companies a reality,” said Fu. \nMEST’s expansion comes as Africa has seen its innovation spaces grow from a handful, less than a decade ago, to over 300, by a recent GSMA tally . Many of those hubs have been shifting away from singular market focus and an over reliance on grant funding toward broader reach and more revenue from investment related activities. This year Kenya’s iHub launched its own startup fund. Nigeria’s CCHub recently launched its Diaspora Challenge to tap talent and investment outside the country. \nFunded primarily by Jorn Lyseggen’s Meltwater Foundation, MEST is also transitioning toward more investment activities. Its seed fund has supported several companies that went on to raise outside capital and two― Claimsync and messaging app Saya ―have been acquired. MEST’s new MD confirmed the incubator plans to launch a VC firm in the near future, though could not provide an exact timeline. \nFu sees a broader benefit to Africa’s tech sector from MEST’s expansion. “We’d like to connect all these smaller, vibrant ecosystems across the continent to present one unified ecosystem,” he said. \nAnd on MEST’s commitment to commercial startups. “We definitely believe in building businesses not apps,” Fu said. “By doing that you create the hero figures to inspire the next generation. That inspires capital to be unlocked across the world to invest in African tech.” 0",

      "text": "430 shares \nI know the next iPhone is coming tomorrow , but I think it’s worth a minute of your time to stop and feast your eyes on the incredible looking Mi Mix 2 from Chinese gadget giant Xiaomi. \nDesigned by Philippe Starck, the successor to last year’s bezel-less wunderphone once again features a gorgeous front fascia that’s practically all display – a 17:9 5.99-inch display, to be precise. It has rounded corners on all sides and is encased in an aluminum alloy frame. \n\nThe slim panel at the bottom is 12 percent slimmer than the one on the Mi Mix and houses the front camera, while a speaker hides at the top in the space between the device’s edge and its display. \nThe Mix 2 is powered by flagship-level components, including: Snapdragon 835 processor 6GB RAM with 64GB / 128GB / 256GB storage options 12-megapixel rear camera with 4-axis optical image stabilization \nThere’s also a Special Edition with a ceramic unibody that Xiaomi says takes seven days to manufacture. It comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage, and costs a bit more than the standard model. \nWith these configurations and that bezel-less build, Xiaomi could stand to take on rival flagships like Samsung’s Galaxy and Note 8, LG’s V30, and dare I say, the next iPhone . The company is also touting global band support, so it’s possible that the Mix 2 will arrive in numerous Asian and European markets. \nWe haven’t yet been able to test the Mix 2, but it looks like the one drawback with this device is the single rear camera. Xiaomi says it’s as good as the primary wide-angle snapper on the Mi 6 flagship – which means it’s great at capturing accurate colors and details – but it won’t be able to pull off Portrait Mode-style shots with plenty of blur to separate your subject in the foreground from the background. \nThe Mi Mix 2 will go on sale in China on September 15 with a starting price of RMB 3,299 ($506); the top-end model with 256GB of space will cost RMB 3,999 ($614). The Special Edition will set you back by RMB 4,699 ($721). It’ll also come to India – a first for this series. \nThat’s pretty competitive pricing for a device with hardware like this. It’ll be interesting to see if it finally gives Xiaomi a chance to go up against premium brands in Europe for the first time.",

      "text": "PewDiePie, the world’s most popular YouTuber, is back making more racist comments Posted The downside of writing up demo days PewDiePie, the world’s most popular YouTube broadcaster with over 57 million subscribers, is back once again making racist comments. \nThe broadcaster, real name Felix Kjellberg, lost a lucrative contract with Disney earlier this year after posting anti-Semitic content and making repeated references to Nazis in videos. \nThis time around Kjellberg, who is known for being the best-paid YouTube star, used the word n*gger during a live-stream video playing of Player Unknown Battlegrounds. The clip below — warning: contains many expletives — captures the moment. PewDiePie, the biggest YouTuber, on his livestream: 'What a fucking n-word'. pic.twitter.com/mISevBEn4T \n— THE POP HUB 👄 (@ThePopHub) September 10, 2017 \nKjellberg later remembered he was live-streaming. His co-broadcaster played down his “weird filter” as a result of him being foreign — in other words a person who doesn’t speak English as a first language. \nThere’s no excuse for racism. \nThere’s also no language barrier here, as anyone who has listened to previous PewDiePie broadcasts will know. In fact, Sweden — where Kjellberg is from — is famous for the highest level of fluency for English as a second language worldwide. \nKjellberg has a history of making racial statements, which is massively concerning given his audience includes viewers who are young and impressionable. \nBack in February, Disney withdrew its contract for the star while YouTube dropped him from its subscription-base Red service in response to nine videos containing anti-Semitic clips or Nazi-related images. \nThey included one skit in which Kjellberg paid a Sri Lanka-based group of men to hold up a sign that read “Death to All Jews,” while another featured a clip of a man dressed as Jesus saying that “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong.” Kjellberg used freelance job finding site Fiverr for both clips. He argued that he wasn’t serious with either and instead wanted to show the things people will do for money. \nAs I wrote earlier in the year, this all may be a joke to Kjellberg but responsibility comes with his influence. \nWhile Kjellberg argues that his content is apolitical, his huge audience, the largest of any channel of YouTube, brings with it a certain level of responsibility on content and messages. That’s particularly true given the large number of children and young people who watch YouTube, and in particular his channel, and may lack the kind of historical context and understanding that Kjellberg assumes them to have. \nIf there were excuses for the Nazi clips, there really are none for using the word n*gger. And already the internet community is fighting back. \nSean Vanaman, whose Campo Santo studio develops popular game Firewatch, said he intends to file DMCA reports to remove all videos and streams of Kjellberg playing his company’s title. I am sick of this child getting more and more chances to make money off of what we make. \n— Sean Vanaman (@vanaman) September 10, 2017 \nVanaman, who said PewDiePie streams of Firewatch gaming had generated 5.7 million views, urged others in the industry to take similar action. \n“He’s worse than a closeted racist: he’s a propagator of despicable garbage that does real damage to the culture around this industry,” he wrote in a series of tweets. 0 ",

      "text": "In the aftermath of the Note 7 debacle, many wondered whether the Note line was done for good. It seems that the latest iteration — despite carrying a high starting price of $930 — has delivered a win for the folks at Samsung. Today, they announced that its pace for U.S. pre-orders of the Note8 have eclipsed those of every other Note release to date.\nNow, generally that’s the case with every follow-up to flagship phones from Apple, Samsung and a select few others, but the fact that Samsung was able to put Explodegate behind it in such quick order, largely — I would imagine — thanks to the device’s huge new 6.3″ infinity display, is pretty impressive.\nOnce recalls were put in place for the Note 7 about a month after it first went on sale in 2016, there were 1 million devices that had to be returned, so that gives us some rough idea to the phone’s early sales.\n“We’re thrilled to see the strong consumer response to the next level Note,” Samsung exec Tim Baxter said in a statement.\nIn my colleague Brian Heater’s review of the device , he declared, “The Note is back, and that’s good news for those who had to give up their beloved device, kicking and screaming. Samsung’s a bit wiser for its sins of the past, and the product is now subject to some of the industry’s most rigorous testing.”\nThe Note8 will be available in retail stores starting September 15, which is incidentally the same day that the official U.S. recall of the Note 7 was put in place.\n ",

      "text": "Sci-fi author and tech advocate Jerry Pournelle dies He was the first big novelist to write solely on computers. Roland Dobbins, Flickr \nThe science fiction and technology worlds are poorer off this weekend, as author Jerry Pournelle has died at 84 after a sudden illness. He was best-known for collaborating with Larry Niven on classic novels like The Mote in God's Eye , but he's equally known as a strong advocate for technology and spaceflight. Significantly, he's widely credited as the first major author to write a published novel entirely on a computer. He bought an extremely expensive ($12,000 in 1977 dollars) machine anticipating that it would let him edit and correct mistakes far more quickly than with a typewriter. While it's virtually a given that authors will write with computers these days, Pournelle spurred many of his peers to buy PCs and ultimately usher in an era of digital writing. \nHis involvement wasn't confined to the literary space, either. He was in charge of the Reagan administration's Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy, and momentarily worked with Senator Newt Gingrich. In the last years of his life, he was also a frequent commentator on technology issues. He was a frequent guest on the TWiT network's technology podcasts, for example. \nPournelle wasn't without controversy. He was both praised and criticized for helping to spark the military sci-fi genre, rather than embracing a more hopeful view of the future. However, there's little doubt that he played important roles in not only popularizing sci-fi, but linking that passion to real-world advocacy.",

      "text": "Linxo raises $24 million for its app that brings bank accounts together Posted PSA: no matter what, Equifax may tell you you’ve been impacted by the hack French startup Linxo just raised $24 million (€20 million) from three financial institutions — Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa and MAIF. The company is building a sort of Mint for the French market. \nBanking apps suck in France. Most of them are just a wrapper around a mobile website. It takes them years to adopt new features, such as fingerprint readers, widgets and more. \nAnd many people have more than one bank account. It becomes quite tedious to check your balance and transactions on all your accounts as you have to deal with multiple shitty apps. \nLinxo is trying to solve that by building an above average app and service that connects to all your bank accounts. The startup supports dozens of French banks. At first, you need to give Linxo your bank account login information. The company’s servers will then periodically sync past transactions. \nThis way, you get a good overview of all your bank accounts in one app. You can see past transactions and charts about money you’re spending. It’s a good way to get insights about your financial situation. \nBut the company plans to go one step further and build a full-fledged financial hub. Its competitor Bankin has already introduced a way to transfer money between accounts in different banks. This feature is currently limited to a handful of banks. \nI’m sure Linxo has something similar in mind, as well as ways to save money, get a credit line and buy insurance products. The company has been working on Linxo Connect, a way to sign up to new financial services without leaving the app, using APIs. \nWith today’s funding round, the startup plans to expand to other European countries. Linxo is also working with French banks to help them with their apps and websites. This could be a lucrative market as well. Featured Image: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images 0 ",

That’s because, as the Associated Press reports , the credit monitoring firm Equifax has suffered a huge data breach that saw names, social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses of 143 million Americans stolen by hackers. \nIt’s a huge amount of user data to be compromised, and will massively damage the reputation of the company. Even more frustrating for most people is the fact that Equifax identified the attack on July 29, but only published details of it on Thursday. \nSo far, the company has yet to explain the delay, though it's come to light that some of its execs sold their shares in the firm during the intervening period . Nevertheless, consumers will be concerned about what may have been done with their data in the meantime. (If you’re worried, Wired has a good explanation of what you should do to cover your back .) \nSomewhat ironically, as the Financial Times points out (paywall) , facing competition in the credit monitoring market, Equifax recently pivoted to specializing in ... fraud prevention and identity management, and selling advice on how to manage data breaches. Clearly, that pivot hadn’t yet resulted in beefing up its own security. \nThe news serves as a reminder that, as we've explained before, new ways must be found to make companies up their security games. Currently, the cyber defenses of many organizations are lacking and they’re slow to respond to known vulnerabilities, but new kinds of incentives could make corporations work harder to keep our data safe . \nSwipe Up To Dismiss Facial Recognition Is Getting Incredibly Powerful—and Ever More Controversial \nA camera trained at your face can reveal an awful lot about you. We’ve written a lot recently about how facial recognition software has reached an incredibly high standard in the last couple of years. So high, in fact, that the technology is robust enough… Read more \nA camera trained at your face can reveal an awful lot about you. We’ve written a lot recently about how facial recognition software has reached an incredibly high standard in the last couple of years. So high, in fact, that the technology is robust enough to be used across China to authorize payments and catch trains . \nBut some recent technologically impressive advances are causing more of a stir. Earlier this week, Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang from Stanford University posted a paper on the PsyArxiv preprint servers , soon to be published by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , which shows that facial recognition AI is more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from pictures of people. \nTrained on 130,741 images taken from dating sites where people explain their sexual orientation, the pair’s neural networks can distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81 percent of cases from just a single photo. That compares to an accuracy of 61 percent for a human. Given five images, the AI’s figures rises to 91 percent. (The same numbers for women are 71, 54, and 83, respectively.) \nThe approach is reminiscent of work described last year by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, who trained neural networks using photographs of known criminals and non-criminals. They were then able to correctly identify criminals from new images with an accuracy of 89.5 percent. \nThe Economist suggests that the same approach could be used to try to identify other qualities, such as IQ or political leaning. The phenomenon is, clearly, troubling to those who hold privacy dear—especially if the technology is used by authoritarian regimes where even a suggestion of homosexuality or criminal intent may be viewed harshly. \nA natural conclusion: maybe we should obscure our faces while out on the streets? \nSadly, another new study may render that idea rather pointless. Late last week, Amarjot Singh from Cambridge University and his colleagues in India published a study on the arXiv showing that in many cases it is possible to identify a person using facial recognition even when their face is obscured. When people are wearing a hat, scarf, and glasses to cover their faces, their algorithms were able to identify people with around 55 percent accuracy. The figure rose to 69 percent when just glasses were removed. \nZeynep Tufekci from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University commented on this final finding on Twitter , described the research as part of an “ever-increasing new capability that will serve authoritarians well.” She likely has a point. \n",

      "text": "23andMe’s second act sits squarely in drug research and development Posted Advertisement 23andMe is best known for its $199 at-home spit-tube DNA test, but the consumer genetics company has been making strides in the last few years to get into drug development and research. The company first began making moves early in 2015, forging a partnership with Pfizer to conduct a bit of drug research using 23andMe’s genetic data. The pact was formed in the midst of orders from the Food and Drug Administration that 23andMe cease sales of its consumer health report product, which drove a major portion of both 23andMe’s revenue and brand awareness at the time. \n23andMe appeared to double down on that effort soon after, announcing a new therapeutics division , recruiting Genentech’s Richard Scheller to lead the program, and bringing on veteran scientists from the pharmaceuticals industry. \nThe FDA has slowly approved genetic health risk tests for certain diseases since. For example, soon after Scheller joined, the agency allowed 23andMe to conduct a test for the rare genetic disease Bloom Syndrome. Earlier this year, it green-lit 10 different genetic risk tests made by 23andMe, including for Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. \nMeanwhile, 23andMe has continued hiring talent with deep roots in pharmaceuticals, including bringing aboard even more scientists from Genentech, which is also an early investor in 23andMe. \nNo wonder. The company now has more than 2 million consumers contributing DNA samples — 80 percent of whom have consented to the use of their information for research; that’s a pretty sizable database to mine for potential new drug targets. Latest Crunch Report Watch More Episodes \n23andMe further conducts online surveys based on genetic information with the millions of customers in its database willing to participate. It has also started a Parkinson’s research study , offered to those eligible and with certain genetic markers for the disease. Last year, 23andMe also started to partner with companies like Celmatix to conduct studies on fertility and genetics . \n23andMe now has more financial muscle to put behind these efforts, too. TechCrunch broke the news this week that 23andMe is currently raising in the neighborhood of $200 million from Sequoia Capital and other investors at a $1.5 billion pre-money valuation . The round still hasn’t closed and things could change, but a big capital infusion should give the company the leverage needed to make further in-roads before it subjects itself to the public scrutiny of an IPO. (Asked for more information, 23andMe declined to comment for this story.) \nEven if a healthy portion of its new funding is used to beef up 23andMe’s therapeutics division, that doesn’t mean the company doesn’t have challenges. In fact, it will instead face a new set of them, including trying to create space for itself despite a very crowded landscape. \n“I don’t see anything that’s going to create differentiation for them over the long run,” says Paul DeSantis, a genomics and immuno-oncology analyst who has looked at 23andMe as a potential investment for his employer, The Gerson Lehrman Group \n“Everyone is so much further ahead of them,” he adds. \nTo DeSantis’s point, there’s plenty of activity right now in pharmacogenomics, or the study of how our genes react to certain drugs. Juno Therapeutics is just one publicly traded company with a focus on cancer drugs targeted to unique DNA markers. Drug maker Novartis also recently announced the development of the first FDA-approved CAR-T cancer immunotherapy drug. \nIn addition, succeeding on any drug breakthrough could well take at least a decade, meaning that a push into drug research could take a while to bear fruit for 23andMe. That could further push out an IPO. \n“When you intend to go public you need to have a lead indication,” says DeSantis. “You need some clinical trial data and you need to have a platform. To me, 23andMe doesn’t have that.” \nMaybe it will, sooner than DeSantis predicts. Maybe it won’t. In the meantime, the company is forging ahead with its original plan to democratize genetic health. Part of that entails working with the FDA to gain approval for more genetic risks tests, including for breast cancer markers BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. If approved, that would give 23andMe a leg-up on competitors like genetics testing upstart Color Genomics by eliminating the need for third-party approval from a physician. \nStill, knowing one may have a genetic marker for a certain disease will only take 23andMe’s customers so far. It would be far more powerful were the company capable of delivering a potential cure. \n23andMe seems to be betting its large trove of data will carry it into a future where it can do both.

      "title": "How This Man Brought the 1967 Gyro-X Self-Balancing Two-Wheeler Back to Life | WIRED",
      "text": "The Quest to Put a 1967 Self-Balancing 'Car' Back on Its Feet Wes Duenkel At the far end of the field, hundreds of yards past the 1930s Duesenbergs, the prewar Rolls-Royces, and the grand touring Ferraris, curious showgoers at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance gather around a particularly unusual kind of car. They listen to the quiet hum and puzzle over the thing, bright red, about 15 feet long, and hardly wider than a motorcycle. The Gyro-X stands out even in this field of one-of-a-kind cars, not for its beauty or elegance but because it stands on two wheels, balanced by the whirling, beachball-sized gyroscope tucked under its hood. It's not the first time it has managed the feat, but it's been awhile. After 50 years of neglect and abuse, the Gyro-X has been reborn, thanks to years of hard work, a small fortune, and some tech borrowed from the luxury yacht industry. Car/Life Balance The Gyro-X was born in 1967, the product of famed car designer Alex Tremulis and gyroscope specialist Tom Summers. Tremulis was the creative force behind the ill-fated Tucker 48 , the funky Subaru Brat , and a series of Ford concept cars that encapsulate what Americans in the 1950s expected of the future. Among them was the Gyronaut X-1, a gyro-balanced motorcycle that set a land speed record of 245.667 mph in 1966 (and is undergoing its own nostalgia-fueled renovation ). Summers had developed gyroscopic tech for missile navigation during World War II and aircraft instruments in the postwar years. In 1966 he brought Tremulis into his Gyrocar Company and raised $750,000 (about $6 million today). Their pitch to investors went something like this: Use a gyroscope, inside of which a wheel spins on an axle, shifting weight to keep the car upright. The Gyro-X could be lighter and narrower than a car on four wheels, and thus more efficient. With a relatively puny 80-horsepower engine, it would hit 125 mph and swoop through 40-degree turns without tipping, no motorcycle skills required of the driver. By simply making all cars so skinny, Tremulis and Summers figured, you could double road capacity. (The car had two seats, one behind the other.) But if you’ve been outside at any time in the past half century, you know the gyro gang didn’t quite deliver. Tremulis and Summers built a prototype of the car, but their effort went bankrupt in 1970, before they could master the tricky engineering and prove their claims. “You can say that’s why it didn’t work back then. It doesn’t work great now.” That sole Gyro-X spent the next few decades bouncing from one owner to the next, at some point losing its gyroscope. In 2009, a collector named Mark Brinker bought the car in the hope of fixing it up, but decided the project was too much work. In 2011, he sold it to the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville, which houses and restores an array of automotive oddities, like the Citroën 2CV Bicephale, a 1950s fire and rescue vehicle than can be driven from either end. Jeff Lane, director of the museum, picked up where Brinker’s research left off, digging up old documents and connecting with Steve Tremulis, Alex’s nephew. He found the original patents and some photos, but nothing detailing how to actually make the replacement gyro. “We didn’t know how to build it, the weight of flywheel, the diameter, the spin rate,” Lane says. So Lane consulted a gyroscope tech company. Nothing came of it. He reached out to General Motors and even one of his old college professors to see if they had any tips. But the solution, it would turn out, wasn't on land at all. Anchors Away Lane didn’t get anywhere until a visitor to the museum’s restoration shop suggested he think about ... yachts, which use stabilizers to keep steady on the high seas so that wealthy water lovers don't get seasick. That led him to Agency Impianti, an Italian firm that sent a representative to Nashville to create a digital version of the car, calculate how big the gyro would have to be, and where it should sit. A year and a half later, Lane cracked open a big wooden crate and spent a month fitting the Gyro-X with its new gyro. The 230-pound gyro, 17 inches in diameter, took up much of the space under the hood, and so they had to fit everything else—hydraulic pumps, the fuel tank, batteries, the engine pulled from a Mini Cooper—around it. Then they took on the rest of the car, fabricating new door panels and a dashboard based on photos of the prototype in its original state. They dumped the fiberglass seat for an aluminum one, as it was in the days of Tremulis and Summers. “It was a lot of work, and it was expensive,” Lane says. He spent about $500,000 in total, more than half of it on the gyroscope. And finally, in May, the team powered up the car, raised the training wheels that keep it from tipping when the gyro’s not running, and started cruising around the parking lot on two wheels. “It felt funny to me,” Lane says. \"The gyro rocks a bit, like you're sitting in a boat.” And then, in its grand debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance last month, the car wowed the judges as well as the crowds, winning its class: American Dream Cars of the 1960s. Now Lane’s team is back to tinkering with the controller software, and an Agency Impianti rep has scheduled an October visit to help out. “You can say that’s why it didn’t work back then—they didn’t have software or the sensors we’ve got,” Lane says. “It doesn’t work great now.” At least, not above 25 mph—the controls aren't precise enough right now to keep the Gyro-X stable at higher speeds. But it's not like Lane is expecting to realize Tremulis and Summers’ dream of putting everyone into two-wheelers. He’s happy with reviving an engaging, original idea. “It’s a beautiful car, an engineering masterpiece, done by two really bright, famous people,” he says. “To bring it back to life is great.” Related Video Auto First Drive Review of Nissan's New Leaf Electric Car Nissan’s new Leaf is an OK electric car—and that’s a great thing.

Social security numbers and other personally identifying information were accessed.\nAnd guess what, the stock market didn’t like it! The company lost about $2 billion in market cap Friday after tumbling nearly 14%.\nApparently, the company has known about the hack since July 29, yet the public was just notified yesterday. I’m sure its stock investors will have plenty of questions about the lack of disclosure.\nWe talked about all this and more on TechCrunch’s latest “Equity” podcast, joined by Ilya Fushman, general partner at Index Ventures.\nClick the player above or check us out on iTunes.\nFeatured Image: Adam Gault/Getty Images 0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "07:00 am Space Photos of the Week: Spiral Galaxy Swaddles Baby Stars in Its Big Dusty Arms It's easy to feel like you never have enough time to accomplish the things you need to do, but that's especially true for the Cassini spacecraft. After nearly 138 days circling between Saturn and its glittering rings, Cassini will end its dance by plunging headlong into Saturn next week. But it still has a few more days to beam back fantastic photos before its very dramatic death. This week during its second-to-last orbit, Cassini sent home a false color image of Saturn's B-rings at the highest resolution ever taken. It also snapped photos of Enceladus, Saturn's icy moon which astronomers crafted into a movie (seen in the gallery as a gif) from six images. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was also hard at work, capturing a photo of the different layers of sulfates in Melas Chasma, a region once thought to be covered in water. A bit closer to Earth, the sun released the largest solar flare observed since the beginning of its solar cycle in 2008. And finally, Hubble spied the sparkling spiral galaxy NGC 5559, its dusty arms cradling a bunch of newborn stars, seen above in bright blue.

      "text": "481 shares \nApple’s next iPhone event doesn’t start until Tuesday, but the internet has been set ablaze with new rumblings after a newly leaked final build of iOS 11 hit the web this weekend. The leak confirmed a lot of what we already knew, but there are a couple of new revelations worth talking about. Face ID \nApple’s firmware leak references Face ID, which appears to be the official name for the advanced facial detection feature we talked about here . The leaked setup animation walks users through the process of setting their phone up to use the feature. Much like Apple’s existing fingerprint sensor, prompts guide you through moving the device to capture your face at multiple angles. \nIf rumors are to be believed, Face ID could be among the most advanced facial recognition technologies to ever grace a mobile device. Status Bar \nWe know the new iPhone will have a near bezel-less display. What we don’t know is how Apple, or developers for that matter, will handle the area around “the notch.” The space to the left and right of the camera notch has been the subject of much debate, and Saturday iOS developer Guilherme Rambo gave us our first glimpse of what that could look like — only on a current generation phone. There's a nice little animation when you connect it to power pic.twitter.com/GFimRxbCAm \n— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) September 9, 2017 AirPod updates \nAccording to 9to5Mac , the AirPods are getting an upgrade as well. It’s nothing major, but a minor tweak sometimes makes all the difference. And for AirPod users, this one should be a welcome addition. \nThe existing charging indicator, for some reason, is located inside the AirPods case. For users, this is a real pain in the ass, as you have to open the case each time you want to check the battery status. Newer AirPods make a design decision Apple should have made with the first generation: moving the battery indicator to the outside of the case. Animated poop emoji? \nApple is also introducing a fairly substantial emoji upgrade. Dubbed ‘Animoji,’ Apple’s new feature reportedly taps the front-facing camera to create cute little animated emoji based on your own facial expressions. Apple described Animoji to The Verge as: “custom animated messages that use your voice and reflect your facial expressions.” \nApple’s still working on including more 3D emoji models, and according to the firmware we should soon see monkeys, dogs, cats, and even the ever-so-popular poop emoji.

      "text": "MIT is crowdsourcing hurricane flood maps in Florida People can submit reports through Twitter DM, Telegram or Facebook Messenger. Save RiskMap \nPeople in Broward County, Florida have one more map to rely on this weekend as Hurricane Irma passes through the state. MIT has launched RiskMap , a crowdsourced platform meant to track and map flooding by relying on people's social media reports, as a pilot project. The county's residents can update the map by contacting its Twitter DM, Telegram and Facebook Messenger chatbots. They'll then have to submit their location, a description of its conditions and a photo showing its current flood level. Other residents and officials planning evacuations or sending help can then see those updates on the map as they go live. \nTomas Holderness, the MIT research scientist who led the project, says RiskMap \"shows the importance that citizen data has to play in emergencies.\" He added that \"[b]y connecting residents and emergency managers via social messaging, [their] map helps keep people informed and improve response times.\" While it's unfortunate that the tool is only useful to residents of one county for now, the team aims to make it available to other locations and to add more social media platforms in the future. \nMIT first tested the map in Indonesia earlier this year when widespread flooding hit the country. A total of 300,000 users visited the website within 24 hours during the event. To make the map even more helpful, it was also integrated into the Uber app, so drivers could quickly see which roads to avoid.",

He produces Futurecast, and is the host of Keen On.\nMore posts by this contributor: The Trump tech bubble Why AI is now at the heart of our innovation economy Casey Wasserman , the founder and chief executive of the Los Angeles based talent agency Wasserman Media Group was tasked by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti to lead the successful bid for the 2028 Olympics.\nIn a recent interview at the Futurecast event at Warner Bros Studios in Hollywood Wasserman elaborated on how technology is changing the Olympics and the benchmark that the 2028 games will set for future generations.\nIn 2028 Wasserman predicts many of today’s nascent digital technologies — from augmented reality to artificial intelligence to self-driving cars to fully functioning smart cities — might already have become realities. Wasserman – a significant angel investor in tech and entertainment startups – predicts that digital technology will be central to the LA 2028 games.\nAugmented reality, he tells me, with its ability to replicate the physical experience of the Olympics to billions of people around the world, offers “a meaningfully significant opportunity”. This revolutionary technology, he believes, will make the experience “so much better” – both for those inside and outside the stadiums. It will empower what Hollywood has always been best at: “the telling of stories”.\nSilicon Valley can help in the preparation for the Games, Wasserman said. Sidestepping the standard Northern versus Southern Californian cliches, Wasserman presents the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics as a united Californian story – of both cutting edge Silicon Valley technology and Hollywood entertainment. “That’s what California is all about,” he says of this marriage. LA 2028 promises to be quite a wedding.\nMany thanks to the folks at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce for their help in the production of this interview.\n ",

Uber has announced that by the end of 2019 all of its drivers in London working on its regular low-cost UberX service will use hybrid or fully electric vehicles, and no diesel cars will be allowed on its network. It plans to extend the policy across the U.K. by 2022, and hopes its London fleet will be all-electric by 2025. As part of the move, it will start a new Clean Air Fund, which will help its drivers upgrade to cleaner vehicles, offering them as much as $6,500 to help swap existing fossil fuel cars for electric or hybrid models. \nWhile diesel cars aren’t prevalent in the U.S., they’re prized for their fuel efficiency in Europe, where pump prices are far higher. But there’s an increasing push on the continent to move away from the fuel , because it also produces far larger quantities of soot and nitrogen oxides than gasoline motors. Many cities are banning diesel cars from their roads , and the U.K. has even announced that it will ban the sale of all new combustion engine cars starting in 2040 . Clearly, Uber is trying to preempt that—and notch up some rare positive PR points, too.

That’s because, as the Associated Press reports , the credit monitoring firm Equifax has suffered a huge data breach that saw names, social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses of 143 million Americans stolen by hackers. \nIt’s a huge amount of user data to be compromised, and will massively damage the reputation of the company. Even more frustrating for most people is the fact that Equifax identified the attack on July 29, but only published details of it on Thursday. \nSo far, the company has yet to explain the delay, though it's come to light that some of its execs sold their shares in the firm during the intervening period . Nevertheless, consumers will be concerned about what may have been done with their data in the meantime. (If you’re worried, Wired has a good explanation of what you should do to cover your back .) \nSomewhat ironically, as the Financial Times points out (paywall) , facing competition in the credit monitoring market, Equifax recently pivoted to specializing in ... fraud prevention and identity management, and selling advice on how to manage data breaches. Clearly, that pivot hadn’t yet resulted in beefing up its own security. \nThe news serves as a reminder that, as we've explained before, new ways must be found to make companies up their security games. Currently, the cyber defenses of many organizations are lacking and they’re slow to respond to known vulnerabilities, but new kinds of incentives could make corporations work harder to keep our data safe . \nSwipe Up To Dismiss Facial Recognition Is Getting Incredibly Powerful—and Ever More Controversial \nA camera trained at your face can reveal an awful lot about you. We’ve written a lot recently about how facial recognition software has reached an incredibly high standard in the last couple of years. So high, in fact, that the technology is robust enough… Read more \nA camera trained at your face can reveal an awful lot about you. We’ve written a lot recently about how facial recognition software has reached an incredibly high standard in the last couple of years. So high, in fact, that the technology is robust enough to be used across China to authorize payments and catch trains . \nBut some recent technologically impressive advances are causing more of a stir. Earlier this week, Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang from Stanford University posted a paper on the PsyArxiv preprint servers , soon to be published by the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , which shows that facial recognition AI is more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from pictures of people. \nTrained on 130,741 images taken from dating sites where people explain their sexual orientation, the pair’s neural networks can distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81 percent of cases from just a single photo. That compares to an accuracy of 61 percent for a human. Given five images, the AI’s figures rises to 91 percent. (The same numbers for women are 71, 54, and 83, respectively.) \nThe approach is reminiscent of work described last year by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, who trained neural networks using photographs of known criminals and non-criminals. They were then able to correctly identify criminals from new images with an accuracy of 89.5 percent. \nThe Economist suggests that the same approach could be used to try to identify other qualities, such as IQ or political leaning. The phenomenon is, clearly, troubling to those who hold privacy dear—especially if the technology is used by authoritarian regimes where even a suggestion of homosexuality or criminal intent may be viewed harshly. \nA natural conclusion: maybe we should obscure our faces while out on the streets? \nSadly, another new study may render that idea rather pointless. Late last week, Amarjot Singh from Cambridge University and his colleagues in India published a study on the arXiv showing that in many cases it is possible to identify a person using facial recognition even when their face is obscured. When people are wearing a hat, scarf, and glasses to cover their faces, their algorithms were able to identify people with around 55 percent accuracy. The figure rose to 69 percent when just glasses were removed. \nZeynep Tufekci from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University commented on this final finding on Twitter , described the research as part of an “ever-increasing new capability that will serve authoritarians well.” She likely has a point. \n",

      "text": "New Uber CEO departs New York Times board Posted PewDiePie, the world’s most popular YouTuber, is back making more racist comments Dara Khosrowshahi, the recently named CEO of Uber, is leaving the New York Times Company’s board of directors. \nAccording to a government filing, Khosrowshahi notified the NYT board on Thursday that he would be resigning from the role because of his new responsibilities at Uber. The former Expedia CEO had been on the board since 2015. \n“Mr. Khosrowshahi’s decision to resign as a director was not due to any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices,” said the filing. Khosrowshahi had served on the audit committee as well as the technology and innovation committee. \nHe wasn’t the only tech vet on the board. Brian McAndrews, former CEO of Pandora, and Rebecca Van Dyck, CMO of Facebook’s Oculus, both have seats. \nThe New York Times was recently criticized for not initially disclosing that Khosrowshahi was on its board when it wrote about him becoming the new Uber CEO. The media publication said it regretted the error, but that Khosrowshahi’s board seat had no impact on its Uber coverage. \nThe company’s stock is up 53% in the past year. \n",

      "text": "Matthew Hussey Contributor Matthew Hussey is a freelance journalist and photographer who consulted on the development of Wikitribune .\n“The business models for journalism are a real challenge,” Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia told me.\n“In particular, the advertising-only business model has been devastating for journalism, as it pushes in the direction of a race to the bottom for clicks with tempting headlines and vapid content.”\nAs it becomes easier to disseminate information, so the pressure to generate more of it at a faster rate grows. One result of that conundrum has been the rise of ‘fake news’.\nEven though the idea of deliberately disseminating information that is known to be false has existed for hundreds, if not thousands of years , it broke through into public consciousness last year.\nImage courtesy of Intellectual Take Out .\nAn analysis by Buzzfeed found that the top 20 fake news stories about the 2016 U.S. presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than the top 20 news stories on the election from 19 major media outlets.\nWhen bored Macedonian teens deliberately create fake news to make some extra cash, and foreign governments use it to change voters’ minds in the French , British and American elections, something needs to change.\nEarlier this year, Impossible Labs was commissioned by Jimmy Wales, to try to come up with a platform that could help combat that problem. In 72 hours .\n“I could have raised money from Silicon Valley and then engage in a year long massive investment in a priori thinking about a model that might not even be of interest to the public,” explains Wales.\nAs a result, we approached the challenge like a traditional hackathon: limit yourself on time, scope and scale, focusing more on building something that could be validated by the public rather than a board of directors, or even a bunch of designers like us.\nWe effectively had three days to create the nucleus for an online newspaper that could represent an alternative to the ad-driven business models that have contributed to the rise in fake news. This is how we went about it – and what we learned along the way.\nProblems We already knew there was a dynamic at Wikipedia that has proven to be quite powerful between Wikipedians and the community at large.\nIn fact, when we started looking more closely at the Wikipedia platform, we found there were some 70,000 active contributors who monitor, write and edit the site every day. The system has lead to a resource that the journal Nature puts on a par with the Encyclopaedia Britannica for scientific accuracy .\nThere is no top-down approach to what stories were written. The community seemed to naturally gravitate towards topical issues on their own, to self-edit, and even improve their own work naturally over time.\nWikipedia is built on a bespoke platform, which we didn’t have the time to build ourselves. So we went with WordPress. This allowed us some flexibility to reconfigure the platform to how journalists and the community would engage with it. It also aligned with Jimmy’s own views on using open-source software .\nOrganisationally, we resisted the temptation to create an editor role, to see if the same self-organisation would naturally occur – Wikitribune now has a full-time editor. The above is how the hierarchy of Wikipedia has formed over time. That took years of refinement, which we didn’t have the time to do.\nThe journalists had their own specialisms, and our brief to them was to generate as much content in as many different mediums as possible. Anything from text, imagery, audio or video. Our thinking was to see if there was a natural way of displaying these formats together. More on that later.\nIn essence, our planning was brutally simple: bring in journalists, seasoned members of the Wikipedia community, give them access to WordPress and then watch what happens.\nWe must admit, as a design agency we would have liked to have planned more or took a more strategic approach. But as soon as we started looking at the challenge, we realised it was more of a human problem, not a technical one, and required us to reassess our approach.\nAs such, we opted to be as lean as possible, and not to top load the process with restrictive wireframes or feature sets that we hadn’t proven were useful to the community.\nA lean approach As the journalists started to create content, we looked at how we could build features or fields in the backend of WordPress to help Wikipedians and journalists work closer together.\nOne particular field was ‘ask for help’. A journalist could write an article and at a certain point ask for help on a certain subject, to see if any members of the community had the information to hand.\nBut early on, we noticed that when journalists began creating their stories, they weren’t relying or even asking the community for help. One journalist even went so far to say they were horrified at the idea of handing over control to people they didn’t know or trust, and it was something they thought would never work. So we had to rethink how we’d change behaviours.\nOne of the features we love about Medium is the comments feature that runs down the right-hand-side.\nIt changes the nature of comments and we hoped, makes them play a bigger role in how we perceive an article than just sticking them at the end like an afterthought. \\\nGenius has a very clever app that lets you comment on any website in a similar way. So we spliced them together to see if this approach might help nudge that relationship between journalists and commenters in a more collaborative direction..\nAs a side note, there’s also a cool little Sidecomment.js plugin on github that could’ve done the job too.\nAs journalists published stories, if someone made a comment, they would be pinged via email that someone had added something to their article. With more time we would have liked to have created multiple different types of comments.\nFor example, if someone thinks a part of an article is biased or needs attribution, it would send different notifications to the journalists. Despite the crude approach, we found this mechanism did start to generate more of a dialogue between both parties.\nBeing a design agency, we wanted this newspaper to look and feel beautiful. But what we learned the more we looked at news, news sites, and even Wikipedia itself, is that design takes a backseat when it comes to the content and the collaboration that came with it.\nOur egos had to be sidelined. The quality of the news was more important than parallax scrolling or creating a design language .\nImage courtesy of Bob Borries\nRe-assessing our own assumptions In those 72 hours, we probably had more discussions about the philosophy of what news was, can we ever be free from bias or subjectivity and how disparate groups work together than we did building bespoke applications.\nWhat emerged at the end of the 72 hours was a rudimentary platform that did one thing very simply: allowed disparate groups of people – journalists, commentators and readers – to have a dialogue with each other that ultimately lead to increased understanding of not only the world around them, but of each other.\nJournalism historically has been referred to as the ‘fourth estate’ . It’s job was to hold governments, corporations and individuals to account and was controlled and operated by powerful and wealthy individuals.\nToday, that power and influence no longer resides in the hands of the wealthy, journalists or even the communities that support them. It lies in the gaps in between all of those people.\nOur approach to Wikitribune was all about making those links more seamless. How to make humans do more together. That may not sound much like what a newspaper looks like today. But we think it’s a glimpse of what they may look like in future.\n0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "Bradley Tusk Contributor Bradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures .\nMore posts by this contributor: When don’t f*** with people’s cars became don’t f*** with people’s phones Why Reed Hastings is the nation’s best chance for curbing the influence of money in politics On Wednesday, the unthinkable happened. Congress managed to act in a sensible, bipartisan way that put the future of consumers, business, and government ahead of the special interest politics and considerations that normally dictate their every move.\nIt didn’t get a lot of attention – it’s hard to compete these days with Harvey, Irma, Donald and Kim Jong Un — but the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously passed the SELF Drive Act.\nThe bill makes it easier for NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the federal Department of Transportation) both to regulate what a self-driving car will look like (rather than each manufacturer and technology developer trying to meet the rules of fifty different states, hundreds of cities and thousands of counties) and to grant permits for hundreds of thousands of self driving cars to hit the road for testing (it will take millions of collective miles of testing before autonomous cars can fully operate anywhere). It now goes to the Senate, but with broad-based, bipartisan support, its chances look good.\nThe SELF Drive Act is a great start and the 54 members of the committee deserve credit for acting in a sensible, thoughtful way (we never hesitate to criticize them when they behave like politicians), but it’s still only a start.\nA lot more work remains on the regulatory front before any real world version of fully autonomous vehicles are available to consumers.\nThere’s the rules of the vehicle and the rules of the road : Autonomous is particularly complicated because the federal government dictates how a car should function but local government dictates how the car then operates (speed limits, licenses, registration, etc…). Trying to pass rules for the operation of autonomous vehicles that are consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction is going to be very difficult.While each major player in the field is doing their own lobbying and politics to influence the direction of local regulation, we need states to come together, decide jointly on rules that make sense, and enact them, pre-empting local jurisdictions. There are just too many towns, cities and counties to work through all of them individually (it’s the same reason why recreational drone startups or ed tech startups have so much trouble: there are far too many jurisdictions, politicians and bureaucrats to intelligently navigate). It’s important that legislators and transportation regulators from different states and staffers from a variety of Governors offices start working together on a common set of rules that can be enacted in multiple states whenever the technology is far along enough to take the next step.\nWhat about trucking? Autonomous cars offer myriad benefits to society: far fewer accidents and injuries, far less traffic, far more productivity, and far more efficient use of vehicles. But so does autonomous trucking.The politics are more complicated because there’s at least a perception that autonomous trucking would replace human truck drivers (between the need for humans in the truck somewhere and the shortage of truck drivers anyway, if done right over time, there doesn’t have to be a lot of displacement) and there’s a central entity – the Teamsters – to weigh in politically and oppose any progress. But ultimately, Congress needs to act just as professionally and impartially on trucking as the House committee just did on cars, even if it makes Jimmy Hoffa and his members unhappy (that’s the price of progress). While adding trucking to the Senate version of the SELF Drive Act is probably a bad idea (not worth risking the whole bill over), the final legislation could give NHTSA authority to make rules around autonomous trucking.\nEthics and Insurance: Beyond ensuring that autonomous vehicles are properly designed and that the rules of the road are logical and uniform, moving into a world of fully autonomous driving means resolving a number of high level policy issues.For example, accidents will still occur sometimes and autonomous cars and trucks will have to react to them. That forces choices for artificial intelligence just like it does for real people. You either swerve left to avoid smashing into the tractor trailer in front of you that just stopped short or you swerve right. On the left are two elderly people. On the right is a teenage girl. Your choice will hurt someone no matter what. The software dictating your autonomous vehicle’s actions has to be programmed to do something. The right answer isn’t easy or obvious. What happens when two autonomous vehicles collide? Who’s liable? And in a world where the number of accidents plummet, should we still require everyone to have auto insurance? Is that fair to consumers? Good for the economy? There’s a lot to work through.\nPrivacy and Hacking: Congress took some steps to address privacy issues around the data produced in testing autonomous vehicles, but ultimately, everywhere you go is far easier to track when the car itself is setting the course and doing the driving.That information could then be shared with anyone: companies who want to sell you stuff, government agencies, your boss. Is that a problem? What limits should be imposed on data sharing? And what about hackers turning autonomous vehicles into weapons? The threat of hacking can be used to justify not moving forward on anything, but it’s still a real world concern that has to be addressed. The House bill does marginally address cyber security (creates an advisory council on it) but more will be needed. Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch\nThese are just a handful of the issues that will need to be adjudicated and resolved before we ever live in a true world of fully functioning autonomous cars and trucks. The benefits of autonomous are so clear and so obvious that even Congress was able to recognize it. But one move in the right direction doesn’t solve the problem or settle the issue. The momentum that got us to this point has to continue and for regulatory change to keep pace with technological change, it probably even has to accelerate. In other words, let’s keep our foot on the gas, so that one day, we won’t have to.\n ",

      "text": "Get ready for a new, much more powerful Apple TV Posted France, Germany, Spain, Italy call for turnover tax for tech giants The current Apple TV is nearly two years old. That’s why it’s not surprising to learn that Apple has been working on a new device for a while. This weekend, an upcoming build of iOS 11 for the next iPhone was leaked and contains a ton of information about unreleased products, including the next Apple TV. \nA previous leak of the HomePod firmware already indicated that Apple was working on an Apple TV with 4K video support. The new device could also support various high-dynamic range standards, such as Dolby Vision, HDR10 and Hybrid Log-Gamma. The company could announce 4K videos on the iTunes Store as well as in the Netflix app. \nAnd now, Steve Troughton-Smith discovered some of the technical specs of the next Apple TV. According to him, the media player is going to receive a major performance gain with a lot more computing power and RAM: …I guess three cores would make it the A10X Fusion. Correction! \n— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 11, 2017 \nApple first shipped the A10 with the iPhone 7 last year. The A10X is an updated version of this chip optimized for the most recent iPad Pro. It’s a surprisingly fast system-on-a-chip. It’s sometimes even faster than a MacBook . \nThe current Apple TV sports an A8 system-on-a-chip, the one that was developed for the iPhone 6. It’s a bit hard to grasp Apple’s progress when it comes to silicon. According to Geekbench , when you compare the A10X with the A8, the A10X is 1.7 times faster for single-core tasks, 2.8 times faster for multi-core tasks and 5.7 times faster for Metal-focused, GPU-intensive tasks. It’s a huge improvement overall. \nThis upgrade in particular is going to feel great when you’re trying to stream 4K videos. Skipping forward and backward should feel snappy. And your videos will never buffer, even if you’re trying to play 4K videos with 60 frames per second (the new iPhones should let you shoot 4K videos with 60 FPS). \nIn addition to a faster system-on-a-chip, Apple could also include 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB. This way, you’ll be able to cache a good chunk of the movie or TV show you’re currently streaming. \nApple could announce the new Apple TV as early as tomorrow during its annual September press conference . The company could also use this opportunity to showcase some new video games running on the Apple TV as it’s quite a capable device now.

      "text": "Roland reissues classic D-50 synth for its 'Boutique' line The new D-05 module has all the sounds of the original plus a few modern extras. Save Roland \nRoland has been reissuing classic synths for a while now with its \"Boutique\" line based on earlier Roland keyboards like the Jupiter 8, Juno 106 and JX-3P. The company has also re-imagined the retro-tastic TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines for classic beats on the go. Now, Roland wants to commemorate the 30th anniversary of another classic, the D-50 Linear Synthesizer. Named the D-05, this compact synth will run you $350 and is available now. \nThe original D-50 was a popular 61-key synthesizer that came out in 1987. It's set of sounds contributed to the sound of a diverse group of artists like Prince, Sting, Michael Jackson and Enya. The D-05 recreates the same sounds and presets of the original, and includes many of the same hardware layouts, including the D-50's innovative joystick that made it easy to morph between different onboard tones in real time. There are a few modern touches as well, including a 64-step polyphonic sequencer and a built-in arpeggiator that can be used on its own or as a way to edit original presets. \nThe D-05 runs on USB power or batteries, has a built-in speaker and can be used as an audio/MIDI interface so that you can just plug it into your Mac or PC without extra hardware. It docks in the same velocity-sensitive K-25m keyboard unit that the other Boutique modules use, as well.",

      "text": "Amazon's new video strategy: make the next 'Game of Thrones' It wants blockbuster dramas that capture worldwide buzz. Save VCG via Getty Images \nAmazon's original shows aren't exactly small indie productions these days, but the internet giant is aiming for bigger. In an interview with Variety , Amazon Studios chief Roy Price says the company is shifting its strategy to focus on huge dramas with worldwide appeal, on the level of Game of Thrones -- basically, the sort of show that prompts online buzz and day-after watercooler talk. To that end, Amazon has ordered shows you might not expect, including a Wong Kar-wai directed show about immigrants in 19th-century San Francisco ( Tong Wars ), a comedy starring Fred Armisen and Maya Rudolph and a comic book adaptation produced by Seth Rogen ( The Boys ). \nThe orders also include pilots for comedies from the creators of How I Met Your Mother ( Making Friends ) and The Office 's Greg Daniels ( Upload ). At the same time, the change-up is cutting shows short: Amazon is cancelling the second season of Z: The Beginning of Everything citing \"priorities\" and hinting that the audience was a \"bubble.\" Other shows are likely to get the cut as well, although there's no shortage of star-studded shows likely to line up with the strategy (such as a crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore). \nPrice is quick to note that Amazon already has shows it believes are buzz-worthy, including The Grand Tour , Man in the High Castle and The Tick . However, he's not shy about wanting more. If your service has leading shows, it \"drives conversations\" and thus the subscriptions Amazon craves as a global video provider. As unfortunate as it may be, the company might have a hard time justifying shows that appeal only to niche audiences, no matter how critically acclaimed they may be. \nThere's certainly pressure for Amazon to step its game. Netflix clearly has a grip on the public consciousness with shows like Stranger Things , and even a relative newcomer like Hulu is punching above its weight with popular programming like The Handmaid's Tale . If Amazon doesn't capture similar attention at least some of the time, it risks being overlooked by people who might not even realize that Amazon is an option.",

      "text": "514 shares \nSpain’s data protection watchdog has fined Facebook €1.2 million euros (roughly $1.44 million), after it found three instances when it collected personal data on its Spanish users without informing them of how it was to be used. \nThe judgement is the latest in a series of legal issues that have befallen the social media giant. According to Mark Scott, Politico’s Chief Politics correspondent, the French, German, and Dutch governments are also looking into how Facebook holds and uses data pertaining to their citizens. \nThe Spanish data protection authority said that Facebook’s privacy policy contains “generic and unclear terms,” and doesn’t go far enough to collect the consent of its users. \nFacebook will likely appeal this ruling. It previously overturned a similar judgement in Belgium , having successfully argued that its base in Ireland means that it’s only subject to Irish law. \n€1.2 million euros barely constitutes a slap on the wrist for a company that has Q2 revenues of $9.32 billion . That said, it’s probably relieved the ruling came before the introduction of the tough new GDPR rules, which could have seen the company fined a percentage of its global annual turnover. \nWe’ve reached out to Facebook, and will update this post if we hear back from it. \nUPDATE : A Facebook spokesperson got in touch. \n“We take note of the DPA’s decision with which we respectfully disagree. Whilst we value the opportunities we’ve had to engage with the DPA to reinforce how seriously we take the privacy of people who use Facebook, we intend to appeal this decision. \n“As we made clear to the DPA, users choose which information they want to add to their profile and share with others, such as their religion. However, we do not use this information to target adverts to people.” \n“Facebook has long complied with EU data protection law through our establishment in Ireland. We remain open to continuing to discuss these issues with the DPA, whilst we work with our lead regulator the Irish Data Protection Commissioner as we prepare for the EU’s new data protection regulation in 2018.”",

      "text": "Typeform, a platform for ‘conversational’ data collection, raises $35M Posted Bankin lets you save money on Yomoni Filling out forms online and on mobile can be a tedious and bug-ridden — yet annoyingly necessary — experience. Today, a startup called Typeform has raised a significant round of capital to help fund its mission to change all that, with a platform that the startup claims gets its customers much better results because the interactive experiences created on it are more intuitive and thus easier to engage with. \nThe startup, based out of Barcelona, today announced a Series B of $35 million led by General Atlantic as it drives deeper into international markets, specifically the US; and expands its tools for developers with more analytics and artificial intelligence features to personalise the experience more. Along with the funding and in keeping with this platform focus, the company today is also announcing a new portal for developers . \n“We are proud to be the first company to transform the online data collection space by creating conversational forms. But now we’d like to take things further,” said Robert Muñoz, co-CEO and cofounder of Typeform, in a statement. He believes that Typeform is playing a role in “bridging the gap between data collection and customer interaction.” \nThis round also included participation from Index Ventures, Point Nine, and Connect Ventures, all previous backers. \nIn total, Typeform has now raised just over $52 million . The valuation with this round is not being disclosed but in its last funding of around $15 million two years ago, Typeform was worth $70 million post-money, David Okuniev, Typeform’s other cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. He added that this latest funding was an “up-round” and its valuation has grown. (I’m asking around to see if I can get a more current number and will update when and if I learn more.) \nHe said the company is ‘almost’ profitable. \nOther notable investors in Typeform include Anthony Casalena, CEO of Squarespace; Javier Olivan, VP of growth at Facebook; and Jay Parikh, Facebook’s VP of engineering. \nIt sometimes happens that the most successful startups are founded in response to an enterpreneur’s frustration with an existing product or service. And so it was the case with Typeform. Co-founders Muñoz and David Okuniev are both designers — specifically with focuses on interaction, UX, and UI — and were running their own agencies back in 2011, when they found themselves working jointly on a single brief (for a toilet company of all things). \nWhen the client asked for a new form to help pick up new business leads and more customer data, the pair were unable to find any suitable online templates or platforms that would not only get users to fill out their information with reliable regularity (no pun intended to the toilet company) but provide details that could be used for sales in the future. \n“We felt there was a lack of attention given to engaging users in the first place,” Okuniev said, who added that the interaction that had been invented for forms hadn’t changed since the 1990s. \nThe two set out to build something themselves, and then used that as the basis of what became Typeform, first launched in 2012, a more dynamic form-creating interface that presented questions one at a time. “We wanted to address that in a serious way, but you could also say it was accidental,” Okuniev said. “We had no intention of building a startup out of this.” \nToday, creating basic online forms is nearly a commoditised business, with companies like Google offering products like Forms free of charge, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter letting people create free polls and other services, and so on. \nUnsurprisingly, Typeform has been iterating on its original product over the years, and today concentrates more on APIs and other developer tools, which are offered in a freemium model based on usage and additional features . \nAt the same time, the startup has very much pushed into making its service something that one can use in any scenario where a user might need to enter data: from basic information entry like job application and contact forms; through to surveys; registration forms; shopping and order forms; online learning and tests; and invitations. \nThe flexibility of the platform, and the focus on making more dynamic interactive experiences, translates into results. Okuniev said that the average conversion rate on one of Typeform’s forms — whether it’s a questionnaire, customer service request, quiz, poll, order form, or something else — is 57 percent, compared to a conversion rate of between 10 percent and 15 percent for more conventional forms. \nIts success is also playing out in user numbers. Today, Okuniev said that the company has 30,000 paying customers, and “a lot more” than this using its free tier. C ustomers include both small and medium sized businesses as well as Fortune 500 companies in the tech, retail, and hospitality industries. \nTypeform’s today describes its form-filling platform as “conversational”, but its original concept behind that pre-dates a lot of the talk we hear today about conversational AI, and bots. \nOn the other hand, Typeform’s ethos is also very contemporary: it focuses on presenting and asking for information using conversational language, and works on the basis of feeding questions one at a time and getting answers in return and tailoring subsequent questions based on those responses. \nThat being said, today, the startup does not use any AI in its platform, although it’s being considered, either by growing it in-house (today the company has around 170 employees, including engineers), or by partnering with an existing firm, or potentially through an acquisition. “AI is definitely on our minds,” Okuniev said. “We are doing some projects internally around user behaviour around form entry and we will be integrating that into the product soon. W e want to help our customers generate more conversations, and we think our products could help with that.” \nThe focus on creating an interactive platform based around natural language is one reason why investors were interested in helping fund the startup to grow. \n“Digital forms are transitioning from a simple data-collection tool into an integral part of the customer engagement journey,” said Chris Caulkin of General Atlantic, in a statement. \nSo, too, is the platform flexibility. “If you think about the proliferation of device types and browsers, including forms and data collection can be a real pain point,” Caulkin said in an interview. “And the solution that Typeform has developed can be easily integrated and managed by the product, not the tech, team.” \nCaulkin is joining Typeform’s board with this round. \nThe interactivity and square focus on sales and customer relationships also makes the company a prime target for acquisition, in my opinion, with companies such as Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Microsoft/LinkedIn and many others all looking at better ways to help businesses interface with users, particularly across platforms with more tricky interfaces, like mobile. In the meantime, Typeform is also working on integrating more with other, existing platforms, such as Mail Chimp. 0",

      "title": "What you missed at the GrubHub trial about 1099 independent contractors | TechCrunch",
      "text": "What you missed at the GrubHub trial about 1099 independent contractors Posted Advertisement In a windowless, 15th-floor courtroom in downtown San Francisco last week, GrubHub was defending its 1099 independent contractor employment model for its delivery drivers. There’s no verdict yet, and there probably won’t be for at least another week. This trial, Lawson vs. GrubHub, is looking to determine whether or not plaintiff Raef Lawson, an ex-GrubHub driver, was misclassified as an independent contractor while delivering food for GrubHub. \nThose who work as 1099 contractors can be their own bosses, meaning they can set their own schedules, and decide when, where and how much they want to work. Being a 1099 contractor can also be a solid, lucrative side-hustle because you could theoretically work for several companies at once. As noted in this trial, Lawson also delivered food for other gig economy startups, including Postmates. For employers, bringing on 1099 contractors means they can avoid paying taxes, overtime pay, benefits and workers’ compensation. \nAlthough Lawson only seeks a small, estimated sum of $586.56, the result of the trial could potentially affect the employment models of companies like Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Caviar, DoorDash and many others. On day one, I noticed a member of Uber’s employment counsel team watching closely, taking notes about the trial. That makes sense, given Uber has found itself as the defendant in similar lawsuits that have ultimately been settled before needing to go to trial . \nLawson’s lawyer, Shannon Liss-Riordan (pictured below), has spent a good chunk of time in this trial focusing on the amount of control she perceived GrubHub to have over Lawson during the time he delivered food for them. She’s trying to prove that Lawson’s employment met the conditions of the Borello test, which looks at circumstances like whether the work performed is part of the company’s regular business, the skill required, payment method and whether the work is done under supervision of a manager. The purpose of the test is to determine whether a worker is a 1099 contractor or a W-2 employee. \n(Photo by Bill Greene/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) \nLiss-Riordan has pointed to incentives to keep acceptance rates high, a system where GrubHub employees can track drivers, supposed “ghost orders,” a scheduling system that makes it difficult to get desired shifts and priority scheduling — something GrubHub COO Stan Chia testified he’s not familiar with, but something former GrubHub driver care specialist Tj O’Shae and Lawson described in their testimonies. \nIn his testimony, Lawson spoke about the acceptance rate hustle and the effect of ghost orders. \n“I wanted to keep my acceptance rate high and get the hourly rate,” Lawson said. “I also wanted to qualify for the weekly bonus and not get deactivated.” \nHe further explained that maintaining a high acceptance rate would make him eligible for the hourly rate, which he said at one point was $15 but later went down to $11. A perfect acceptance rate, according to Lawson, meant he and other drivers would be eligible for priority scheduling and qualify for a weekly bonus, which was an extra $2/hour up to 40 hours, he said. \nPriority scheduling, if it exists, matters because Los Angeles, where Lawson drove for GrubHub, “was one of the most competitive markets for shifts that we had,” O’Shae said in her testimony. Drivers would describe the process to get shifts as a “mad scramble,” she added. \nWith these alleged ghost orders affecting the acceptance rate of drivers, Liss-Riordan believes GrubHub used “ghost orders” to keep drivers “on their toes,” she said. By allegedly keeping drivers on their toes, the drivers would in theory be more inclined to accept every order they received. \nGrubHub’s core business \nOne of GrubHub’s mission’s in this trial is to prove delivery is not part of its core business and that its drivers were free to essentially do whatever they wanted — meaning they didn’t have to report to anyone. Both of those elements are factors in the Borello test. According to Chia, delivery is not part of GrubHub’s core business and it never has been. \n(Photo by Karen Ducey/Getty Images) \nWhen GrubHub lawyer Theodore Boutrous, Jr. (pictured above) asked if GrubHub considers itself to be a “food delivery company,” Chia responded, “No, we do not.” \n“It is still to be the premiere marketplace connecting diners with restaurants,” Chia said. \nChia spoke about the value of GrubHub as a marketing and discovery tool for restaurants, noting how GrubHub enables diners to discover restaurants they wouldn’t otherwise know about. \nGrubHub began testing food delivery in 2014, ten years after it launched. In 2015, GrubHub officially started offering delivery as a service to restaurants that don’t have their own delivery services. \n“It’s a service we built out at the request of restaurants,” Chia said. \nGrubHub merged with Seamless in 2013 and last month announced its intent to buy Eat24. Both of those companies also offer on-demand delivery. Still, Chia said the company is focused on the marketplace aspect of the business and is “not proactively trying to grow” the delivery portion of the business. \nChia later spoke about GrubHub’s business in California, and how GrubHub only facilitates delivery in five of the 200+ markets in which it’s active. He said the delivery portion makes up a minority of GrubHub’s overall business. \nIn fact, he said “we lose money and we cannibalize our profits on the delivery portion of the business.” \nIn cross-examination, Liss-Riordan asked why GrubHub’s acquisition strategy seems to suggest it highly values on-demand delivery companies. Chia noted that Eat24 doesn’t facilitate deliveries, but rather relies on the restaurant to supply their own delivery people. \n“I don’t know that I would say we’re doing any of this to grow a delivery business,” Chia said. \nAnd while the majority of customers who order food through GrubHub have it delivered, Chia said, the majority of those delivery orders are handled by restaurants and their own staff. This is all to say that GrubHub itself does not handle much of the delivery process itself, but rather the facilitating of it. \nIn his testimony, Chia also spoke about how drivers like being independent contractors. In cross-examination, Liss-Riordan brought up a lawsuit in which more than 7,000 GrubHub drivers are saying they were improperly classified as 1099 contractors. She asked if Chia was aware of that, to which he said he was not personally aware of the number of claims. \n“I’m aware broadly of lawsuits against us,” he said. Looking ahead \nThis week, GrubHub will be back in court. Throughout the rest of the trial, we’ll hear from Rudy Mendoza, who worked as a general manager in Los Angeles during the time Lawson drove for GrubHub, GrubHub Director of Driver Network Operations Bill Francione, a custodian of records for Postmates and others. If you’re wondering why Postmates would get dragged into this, it’s because GrubHub’s lawyers believe Lawson “figured out how to game the system with Postmates just how [he] figured out how to game the system with GrubHub,” Michele Maryott, another lawyer for GrubHub, said. \nIt’s not clear what yet is happening with that little mini-trial around Lawson’s work ethics at Postmates and how they relate to his work ethics at GrubHub, but I’m sure that will come up again this week. \nIn the grand scheme of things, what happens in this trial could potentially affect other gig economy companies and the types of employment models they choose to use with their delivery workforce. Some companies, recognizing that some people don’t want to be independent contractors, have already made the switch from 1099 to W-2. Those who work for Munchery and Instacart, for example, are classified as W-2 workers. \nIn 2015, a Recode analysis estimated it would cost Uber $209 million to reclassify 45,000 drivers in California. As companies like Uber, Lyft and Postmates are still trying to reach profitability, the costs of reclassifying their workers could have a negative impact on their respective bottom lines. \nStay tuned, but in the meantime, here’s a look at the employment models some gig economy companies use.

      "text": "Virginia to replace voting machines over hacking concerns It's worried they'll be prime targets for interference. Save Reuters/Jonathan Ernst \nStates are understandably nervous about the security of voting machines given both the possibility of Russian interference in the 2016 election and machine makers' own shortfalls . And in Virginia's case, officials aren't taking any chances. The state's election board has approved a Department of Elections recommendation to make counties to replace direct-recording electronic voting machines with devices that produce a clear paper trail. Virginia had already instituted a law phasing out touchscreen voting hardware by 2020, but the new move effectively bumps up that end date to November 7th, when the state holds elections for the governorship and other key positions. \nThe move is effectively forcing the Virginia government's hand. As Politico points out , Governor McAuliffe had asked the legislature for money to buy more secure voting machines two years ago, but was shot down. Now, there's not much choice -- the direct-recording machines are no longer certified, so something has to take their place. \nThere's no guarantee that other states will follow Virginia's lead, provided the decision holds up. The Elections Department has notified other states of its recommendations, however, and it won't be surprising if other states follow suit given how anxious they are about hacking attempts. Paper records are the only relatively surefire way to verify the accuracy of election results, and the steep cost of replacing them (McAuliffe wanted $28 million) may be worth it for the peace of mind when a vote comes into question.",

      "text": "The next iPhone creates animated emoji from your facial expressions And another leak hints that it will be called iPhone X. Save 9to5Mac/Apple \nYou may already know that the next iPhone will use face detection for all kinds of clever tricks, but here's one you probably weren't expecting: customized emoji. The 9to5Mac crew has discovered that leaked \"gold master\" iOS 11 firmware includes references to 'Animoji,' or 3D emoji that you create using your facial expressions and voice. Pick one of the familiar non-human faces in the emoji library and it'll map your eye, mouth and cheek expressions to that character -- you can make a robot smile or have a dog raise its eyebrows. Even the poo emoji can be animated. This comes across as a gimmick (we can see many people dropping this once the novelty wears off), but it shows what's possible now that Apple has face tracking at its disposal. And there's more to the leak than just emoji. \nThe scoop also offers more clues as to what the next iPhone can do. The camera will be more powerful, for one thing: in a confirmation of previous leaks, you can shoot 4K video at 60 frames per second, and slow-motion 240FPS video at 1080p. It'll also have an adaptive True Tone display like on the iPad Pro . The face-based authentication system appears to be relatively advanced, as you have to pivot your head in a circle to make sure it can recognize you from a wide range of angles. And if there was any doubt that the home button is going away , Apple just removed it: apps on the next iPhone have a line at the bottom indicating that gestures are available. \nA separate code search by Steve Troughton-Smith may have also revealed the finished name. The brand new, all-screen iPhone appears to be called iPhone X. The revamped versions of the classic design, in turn, would be called the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. Yes, Apple may be skipping the \"S\" naming scheme for the first time since it was instituted back in 2009 with the iPhone 3GS . \nThere are also mentions of dual-camera iPhone owners getting a Portrait Lighting mode that could alter the perceived lighting of a shot. You could add a stage lighting effect, or add the soft tones of natural lighting to a harshly-lit picture. \nOther hints? We've already seen references to the LTE Apple Watch , but there's also evidence of updated AirPods . The only conspicuous change entails moving the charging light to the outside of the case (no more flipping the lid), but we wouldn't rule out under-the-hood revisions. The one sure thing is that Apple will have a lot to talk about during its September 12th event.",

      "text": "Author: Brendan Nystedt. Brendan Nystedt Gear Date of Publication: 09.09.17. Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am 5 Must-Have Nintendo Switch Accessories, From Better Controllers to Backup Power \nWhether you use it for portable gaming or keep it docked and connected to your TV for console-style shootouts, Nintendo’s Switch is a truly unique video game console. In either mode, you’ll want the best accessories available to get the most from your Switch. These picks will let you play longer, download more games, and dare your friends to just try to beat you at Mario Kart 8 . Nintendo Switch Pro Controller \nIf you’re planning on kicking back and fully immersing yourself in Zelda: Breath of the Wild , Nintendo’s first-party option best wireless controller you can buy. The Pro Controller was comfortable to hold for extended periods, and it reliably registered every tap. Pronounced face buttons and satisfyingly contoured grips make it luxurious upgrade. $80 Credit: Nintendo \nIf you’re planning on kicking back and fully immersing yourself in Zelda: Breath of the Wild , Nintendo’s first-party option best wireless controller you can buy. The Pro Controller was comfortable to hold for extended periods, and it reliably registered every tap. Pronounced face buttons and satisfyingly contoured grips make it luxurious upgrade. $80 Nintendo Joy-Con \nExtra Joy-Con can bring you extra joy! Nintendo’s known for its killer couch co-op, and spare Joy-Con will let you play four-player Mario Kart or ARMS at a moment’s notice. When it’s time to get off the sofa, these tiny, detachable controllers are small enough to tote with you. Included with each Joy-Con is a wrist strap so you can flail away without worrying about your controller turning into a TV-shattering projectile. Buy them in red, blue, or yellow to bring a splash of color to your Switch. | $80 Credit: Nintendo \nExtra Joy-Con can bring you extra joy!

When looking for a battery that’ll work best with Switch, make sure to choose a model that can pump out enough power to let you charge the battery while you continue to play. This RAVPower USB-C power bank puts out 30W, so it meets that requirement. Of course, the other USB ports on the RAVPower battery let you top-off phones, tablets, and your other tech essentials. | $80 Credit: Ravpower \nSince the Switch has a USB-C port, an external battery can earn you extra hours of play.

For under $50, you can pick up one of its retro-styled Bluetooth controllers. No matter if you grew up with the NES, SNES, or even if you prefer the OG Japanese Famicom, 8bitdo has a controller that’ll suit your aesthetic tastes. Even though the NES30 Pro controller I tried was lightweight, its buttons and analog sticks feel precise. The only snag is that this controller doesn’t have NFC or any sensors inside, so it won’t work with tilt controls or Amiibo in supported games. | $50 Credit: 8bitdo \nIf the thought of using a Joy-Con on its side makes your hands cramp up, then 8bitdo has an affordable alternative.

So, why not invest in a humongous SD card? Grab a 128 GB microSD from SanDisk, and you’ll have enough space to last you years. Pop it in, forget about it, and download tons of games. Easy peasy. | $44 Credit: Sandisk \nWhile you can still buy games on cartridges for the Switch, some titles need extra storage. So, why not invest in a humongous SD card?

      "text": "Kodi fights trademark trolls trying to charge for its media app It doesn't like that others are trying to profit from free software. Save AOL \nKodi doesn't just have to worry about add-ons and devices that give it a reputation as a piracy haven. The media center app developer has revealed that it's battling \"trademark trolls\" who've registered the Kodi name as their own and are using that mark to profit from software that's supposed to be free to distribute. The culprits may charge you to host Kodi on a website, for example, or make you buy their Kodi boxes instead of others. And this isn't a theoretical worry, either. \nThe team points to the example of Geoff Gavora, who registered the Kodi trademark in Canada and promptly used that to boot devices off of the country's local Amazon store. Now, anyone who wants to buy a Kodi box from Amazon in Canada has to either spring for Gavora's hardware or hope that someone is willing to pay him a fee to make their own. You don't have to turn to Amazon if you want to buy or build a Kodi box, but this still limits your choices. \nThe Kodi developers aren't embroiled in any lawsuits \"so far,\" and they note that a few trademark holders gave up their claims under the pressure of existing piracy lawsuits. However, the Kodi crew is starting to fight back. While it's not actively planning lawsuits, it's trying to both raise awareness of trolling and threatening to take \"legal action\" if it has no choice but to assert the free nature of its software. Will trademark hogs take the threat seriously? Not necessarily, but they can't say they weren't warned. And if nothing else, this is a reminder that open source idealism only matters so long as everyone respects the concept -- and that may mean dragging people into court. ",

      "text": "The 340 million users of Sina Weibo, China’s popular microblogging service, have been given one week to link their accounts to a real name. The crackdown is being conducted in order to comply with new government rules restricting anonymous online conversation.\nThere have actually been similar rules since 2011, but the company never really enforced them, since, as has been demonstrated over and over, enforcing a real-name requirement is easier said than done. Many users would rather quit than submit to having their online communications, previously anonymous or pseudonymous, attached to their real identity.\nIt’s all part of a redoubled effort toward censorship on the part of the Chinese government, which in addition to instituting the real-name rule last month has been combating VPN use, further pruning online discussion and limiting foreign content. No dissent, please! It’s unpatriotic.\nThis real-name rule may prove to be the downfall of Weibo, which has a Twitter-like role in China despite being submitted to constant and increasing censorship. If it really has to kick off anyone who doesn’t provide adequate documentation of their identity, it may lose millions and millions of users.\nFeatured Image: Jon Russell / Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN MODIFIED) 0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "Announcing the complete agenda for Disrupt SF, plus five reasons why you need to be there Posted Shockingly, Congress acted responsibly in regulating autonomous cars… So what’s next? Our Disrupt SF (September 18-20) is just a week away, and we’ve made Disrupt SF more engaging and useful than ever for founders and investors alike, in addition to providing a pretty mind-blowing speaker line-up for the main stage. The latest agenda is below. But first, here are five reasons why you don’t want to miss the best Disrupt SF yet. (And here’s where you can grab a ticket ). CrunchMatch is how we connect founders with the right investors (and vice versa). Our partner Brella to makes the matches based on profiles that take no time to fill out, and once approved by both sides, sets meetings times at assigns meeting tables in a reserved area at Disrupt. Couldn’t be easier, which is why a week before the show there are already 1000 appointments in the works! Off-The-Record sessions are a new addition to Disrupt and a response to feedback that attendees want more opportunities to engage with our speakers on the big topics: AI, Crypto, China Cross Border, Biotech, AR/VR, robotics and security. We’ve persuaded speakers like Sebastian Thrun and Vitalik Buterin among many others to go into a second session, after their interviews on stage, where they can extend the conversation in a roundtable format with fellow experts and Disrupt attendees. Startup Alley will feature more than 500 startups and we’ve organized the alley based on important categories, including AI, Crypto/blockchain, Security/Privacy, health/Biotech, Robotics/Drones, enterprise and more. To ensure we got the best early stage startups, we staged a competition that gave exhibit spots free of charge to the top three top applicants in each category. See the full startup list here . Because, Include. The TechCrunch team works very hard provide a programming and judging slate that is diverse. We even publish a yearly account of how we’re doing . At Disrupt SF, for example, 35% of our speakers and 58% of our Battlefield judges will be women. That’s just one of the many reasons why Disrupt is so interesting and rewarding. Startup Battlefield speaks for itself, considering that its 648 participants to date have raised $6.9 billion and produced 95 exits. Our newest crop of 20 contestants will be unveiled Monday Sept. 18 and take the stage over three days to see who holds aloft the Disrupt Cup and collects a $50,000 check. \nAnd now for the updated Disrupt Agenda…. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18 \nOpening Remarks: Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch Editor-in-Chief \n9:05 AM – 9:25 AM Fireside Chat with Heather Adkins (Google) How a founding member of Google’s security team sees today’s security landscape after having kept the company’s data out of the hands of hackers for 15 years. \n9:25 AM – 9:45 AM ",

      "text": "Xiaomi unveils second bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone and new Mi Note phablet Posted Apply to exhibit — for free — in Startup Alley at Disrupt Berlin It’s the day before iPhone launch and Xiaomi is back at it again with the unveiling of the follow-up to last year’s highly-acclaimed and near-bezel-less Mi Mix smartphone . \nThe Mi Mix 2 keeps the previous design aesthetic — developed by a team led by designer Philippe Starck — but with a slightly smaller six-inch display and improved 18:9 screen resolution. The bezel is minimal once again, and the Chinese phone maker claims to have trimmed the lower border down by a significant 12 percent. \nIt’s a pretty striking look — once again — and it fits with the biggest trend in devices this year, minimizing the bezel in exchange for maximum front screen size. It’s a train that Samsung, LG and (reportedly) Apple have all bordered to help stand out from the rest. Xiaomi went a little further last year when it removed the front speaker to optimize the screen, and it’s the same story this year. Again, it has opted for a piezoelectric ceramic acoustic technology setup to minimize the speaker, but this time it actually occupies some space on the device rather than being buried last year, which had caused some audio issues. \nThere are some notable internal upgrades, including a higher quality camera that uses a Sony IMX386 sensor — bringing it up to par with the Mi 6 — and Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB RAM powering the phone. \nThe options start at 3299 RMB ($506) for 64 GB of storage, with 3599 RMB ($550) for 128 GB and 3999 RMB ($613) for 256 GB. A special edition model that includes an impressive ceramic unibody and pairs 8GB RAM with 128 GB of storage is on offer for a more pricey 4699 RMB, or around $720. mi mix 2",

      "text": "Many of you have strong personal and political beliefs (or so I hope) — but aside from tweeting angrily, what’s the most effective way to put those beliefs into action?\nTech:NYC , a nonprofit group advocating for the New York tech industry in state and city politics , is addressing that problem with a new website called Tech Takes Action .\nYou may remember that Tech:NYC was launched onstage at our Disrupt NY conference by Oath CEO Tim Armstrong and Union Square Ventures co-founder Fred Wilson (Oath owns TechCrunch). It’s already been vocal on some issues, particularly by bringing together tech CEOs to speak out against President Trump’s immigration ban .\nWhile the organization is focused on bigger policy questions, Tech Takes Action can help you get involved individually. Over time, the site will highlight various issues, pointing to different actions that people can take and different organizations they can support.\nImmigration is in the news again thanks to Trump’s decision to repeal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , so that’s the first issue Tech Takes Action is focusing on. The website currently directs visitors to call Congress , support the NYC/CUNY Citizenship Now! Volunteer Corps and donate to the Brooklyn Community Foundation Immigrant Rights Fund .\nTech:NYC Executive Director Julie Samuels writes :\nOur ecosystem and our economy are strongest when we embrace diversity and inclusivity, which is why we need to act …\nAnd so today we are launching Tech Takes Action , a site we built with support from our friends from Warby Parker. Tech Takes Action will provide curated opportunities to speak up, give back, and chip in, and we’re kicking it off with a focus on immigration. We’ll update the site regularly, giving the teams at our member companies the opportunity to pool resources across the community and stand up for the values that we all believe in.\nFeatured Image: ChrisHepburn/Getty Images ",

      "text": "The oversight court for the UK’s intelligence agencies has said Europe’s top court should rule on the legality of powers that give the country’s spies the ability to collect and interrogate various forms of data in bulk (aka mass surveillance).\nState agencies’ current use of bulk collection has been challenged by privacy rights group, Privacy International, which asked the tribunal to consider the lawfulness of the use of so-called “Bulk Communications Data” (BCD), and “Bulk Personal Data (BPD) under European human rights law.\nBCD refers to communications metadata — so the what, where, who and why of digital communications (excluding the content of messages, but with all the granular digital data points needed to triangulate and infer massive amounts of context).\nWhile BPD refers to large databases of maintained and utilized by intelligence agencies, plugged into their analytics systems (so fully searchable via their ‘selectors’), with data, scraped from various public and private/commercial sources, which can include highly sensitive information such as political affiliation, sexual orientation, religion, racial and ethnic origin.\nLast year the tribunal ruled that UK agencies’ use of bulk powers had been illegal for a period of around a decade, prior to 2015 — because they had not been avowed in parliament. The difference now is the government has written bulk collection into law. But the question is whether in doing so it has breached EU human rights law.\nIn a judgement handed down yesterday the Investigatory Powers tribunal said both sides saw the necessity for a reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ)’s grand chamber.\nDuring the course of this case, the ECJ has ruled on another challenge — brought against emergency surveillance legislation rushed through the UK parliament in 2014 (called DRIPA ) — stating in December that “general and indiscriminate” state data retention regimes contravene EU law.\nBut while DRIPA was overturned by the ruling, it was temporary legislation and had already been sunsetted in the UK — replaced by a new surveillance regime: the Investigatory Powers Act. So it’s a legal challenge to the bulk powers contained within that current regime that’s ongoing here.\nAnd even though EU judges have already made it clear EU Member States cannot establish “general and indiscriminate” data retention regimes, the government is trying to drive a wedge between that finding and matters of national security, arguing that the use of bulk data capabilities is “critical” to national security.\nIntelligence agencies also told the court that if December’s ECJ Watson judgement — named for the Labour politician, Tom Watson, who brought the challenge — were applied in the field of national security it “would effectively cripple the SIAs’ [security and intelligence agencies’] Bulk Data capabilities”.\nThe tribunal, which was established in 2000 and prior to the fallout from the 2013 Snowden disclosures about government’s mass surveillance programs had never upheld a complaint against the agencies whose work it is tasked with overseeing, said in its judgement: “We have carefully considered the evidence before us, both from the Claimant and the Respondents, and we are persuaded that if the Watson Requirements do apply to measures taken to safeguard national security, in particular the BCD regime, they would frustrate them and put the national security of the United Kingdom, and, it may be, other Member States, at risk.”\n“By the end of the hearing it was clear that both parties either agreed to or saw the necessity for a reference to the Grand Chamber, and the need for it is, we suggest, obvious from this Judgment,” it added. “Neither party in the event contended that the questions we have considered are either acte clair, or acte éclairé as a result of the Watson judgment.”\nThe Guardian reports that part of the state evidence given to judges included a statement from MI5’s deputy director in which he claimed that without BCD it would be necessary for the intelligence agencies to carry out “other and more intrusive inquiries” — such as making “many more individual requests for CD [communications data] or use other more intrusive powers in order to narrow the scope of a search”.\n“The inability to use BCD would therefore involve greater intrusion into the privacy of individuals,” the MI5 deputy director also claimed.\nThe tribunal also heard evidence from agencies that in 2005, and on the basis of what they couched as “sensitive but fragmentary intelligence”, agencies had been able to apply filters to a BPD to reduce “pool of 27,000 candidates” down to one person who they claim was identified as a “suspected potential al-Qaida suicide bomber”.\nOn the other side of the argument, Privacy International’s lawyers pointed out that metadata in the modern Internet age is massively revealing about individuals — therefore necessitating “strict safeguards against the state accessing highly sensitive information about us”.\nThe group said it fundamentally disagrees with the government’s position that data access safeguards set out the Watson judgement — such as requiring a judge to approve access to highly sensitive information — should not apply to national security.\nThe UK’s now defunct DRIPA regime was rushed through parliament in 2014, and subsequently ruled unlawful under European Human Rights law by a UK high court in 2015 — after a civil rights group challenged it for targeting an overly broad range of data and having an extremely lax access regime.\nYet the government persisted in pushing to legislate for a permanent state surveillance regime that cements bulk collection as its foundational core, claiming such powers are necessary for counterterrorism efforts.\nAt the end of 2016 parliament passed the current legislative framework for investigatory powers, cementing the intelligence agencies’ old bulk processes into dedicated legislation. Previously agencies had relied on vague clauses in obscure and outdated laws to authorize their use of the powers (illegally, as it turned out).\nThe new IP Act has also expanded the UK state’s bulk collection via a new requirement for ISPs to retain browsing data on all their users for 12 months. Though, on the flip side, it also brings in a new oversight regime for use of the most intrusive powers based on warrants being authorized by ministers and judges. This does not apply to accessing the ISP browsing data, however.\nIn yesterday’s judgement the intelligence agencies’ oversight court refused Privacy International’s request to expedite the matter to the ECJ — which means it will likely take years more before the court makes a judgement.\nAt which point the UK will be further down the road of the brexit process of leaving the Union — and the government has said it wishes to remove the country from the jurisdiction of the ECJ.\nSo years more uncertainty are a given here. And, yes, that is the sound of a can being kicked very far down the road. Let’s all go and look at some cats.\nSometimes you just need a cat break. https://t.co/WkHS86YwQO\n— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 7, 2017\nFeatured Image: Harshil Shah / Flickr UNDER A CC BY-ND 2.0 LICENSE ",

      "text": "Facebook fined €1.2M for privacy violations in Spain Posted Typeform, a platform for ‘conversational’ data collection, raises $35M Another privacy-related fine for Facebook in Europe: The Spanish data protection regulator has issued a €1.2M (~$1.4M) fine against the social media behemoth for a series of violations regarding its data-harvesting activities. \nSpain’s AEPD said an investigation into how Facebook collects, stores and uses data for advertising purposes found it is doing so without obtaining adequate user consent. \nIt says it identified two serious infringements and one very serious infringement of data protection law — with the total sanction breaking down to €300,000 for each of the first breaches and €600,000 for the second. \nThe regulator found Facebook collects data on ideology, sex, religious beliefs, personal tastes and navigation — either directly, through users’ use of its services or from third party pages — without, in its judgement, “clearly informing the user about the use and purpose”. \nNot obtaining express consent of users to process sensitive personal data is classified as a very serious offense under local DP law. \nFacebook’s use of web browsing cookies was also found in violation of privacy laws, with the regulator saying it confirmed users are not informed that their information will be processed through the use of cookies when they are browsing non-Facebook pages that contain Facebook’s ‘Like’ button social plug in — noting that while some of the use of this data is declared as being for advertising, other use is “secret”, i.e. not disclosed by the company. \n“This situation also occurs when users are not members of the social network but have ever visited one of its pages, as well as when users who are registered on Facebook browse through third party pages, even without logging on to Facebook. In these cases, the platform adds the information collected in said pages to the one associated with your account in the social network. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the information provided by Facebook to users does not comply with data protection regulations,” it noted. \nThe regulator is also unhappy that Facebook does not delete harvested data once it has finished using it — saying it had been able to verify Facebook does not delete web browsing habits data, but in fact “retains and reuses it later associated with the same user”. \nIt also found this to be true even when the company had been explicitly requested to delete data by a user. \n“Regarding data retention, when a social network user has deleted his account and requests the deletion of the information, Facebook captures and treats information for more than 17 months through a deleted account cookie. Therefore, the AEPD considers that the personal data of the users are not canceled in full or when they are no longer useful for the purpose for which they were collected or when the user explicitly requests their removal, according to the requirements of the LOPD [local data protection law], which represents a serious infringement,” it said. \nThe AEPR, which noted it liaised with other DPAs — in Belgium, France, Germany (Hamburg) and the Netherlands, which also have their own separate investigations into these issues, initiated following Facebook’s 2015 T&Cs change — said Facebook’s existing privacy policy was judged to contain “generic and unclear terms”, and to “inaccurately” refer to the use it will make of the data it collects. \nThe regulator asserted that a Facebook user “with an average knowledge of the new technologies does not become aware of the collection of data, nor of their storage and subsequent treatment, nor of what they will be used”. \nIt also points out that unregistered Internet users would not be unaware that the social network collects their browsing data — something that has already got Facebook into trouble with other European DPAs . \nCommenting on the regulator’s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us the company intends to appeal the decision, while also noting that its European business is (currently) regulated under Irish data protection rules, where its EU HQ is sited. \nIt provided the following statement: \nWe take note of the DPA’s decision with which we respectfully disagree. Whilst we value the opportunities we’ve had to engage with the DPA to reinforce how seriously we take the privacy of people who use Facebook, we intend to appeal this decision. As we made clear to the DPA, users choose which information they want to add to their profile and share with others, such as their religion. However, we do not use this information to target adverts to people. \nFacebook has long complied with EU data protection law through our establishment in Ireland. We remain open to continuing to discuss these issues with the DPA, whilst we work with our lead regulator the Irish Data Protection Commissioner as we prepare for the EU’s new data protection regulation in 2018. \nThe size of the AEPR fine is of course a mere pinprick for Facebook whose 2016 revenue was $27.64BN. So really its appeal against the fine is about the company trying to bat away any perception that it violates privacy by refuting the substance of the violations being asserted here. \nBut seen through the prism of stricter incoming EU data protection rules, under the new GDPR regime which comes into force next May, there are certainly serious financial considerations for Facebook’s business pertaining to privacy — as the new EU regime includes a far larger stick to beat companies that are judged to have violated data protection rules while also tightening up privacy rules by, for example, expanding the definition of personal data and giving EU citizens the right to ask for their data to be deleted. \nCompanies will be facing fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for privacy violations under GDPR. So, in Facebook’s case, privacy-related fines could start to scale to over a billion dollars. And penalties of that size aren’t something the tech giant can too often and too easily sweep under its revenue carpet. \nEven as GDPR strengthens the consent requirements for processing personal data, and expands the risk of holding and processing lots of personal data. \nIn addition, a company like Facebook, which processes data across multiple EU Member States’ territories, may find the new regulation creates a situation where it faces more concerted action from other DPAs, i.e. beyond their local data authority where they’ve established a European base. So, in Facebook’s case, it may not so easily be able to claim to be only under the jurisdiction of the Irish DPA. And in Europe, it’s fair to say that some DPAs are decided more pro-privacy than others. \nAsked about its GDPR preparations, Facebook previously told us it has designated a cross-functional team to “fully analyze the legislation and help us understand what this would mean from a legal, policy and product perspective” — saying this is “the largest cross functional team in the history of the Facebook family”. \nIt is also now looking to recruit a data protection officer — a position mandated under GDPR. \n“Ahead of next May we are working with our product, design and engineering teams to enhance existing products and build new products in a way that simultaneously provides an intuitive, user-centric experience and permits us to meet our obligations under the GDPR,” added Stephen Deadman, Facebook’s deputy chief global privacy officer, in a statement.",

      "text": "Volvo buys premium app-based valet service Luxe To acquire its tech and its team of engineers. Save Luxe \nVolvo has just acquired the app-based valet service Luxe, which let users coordinate a driver to park, wash and refuel their car. But the Swedish automaker didn't pick it up just to convenience its customers -- it wants Luxe's technology and engineers, too. \nThe valet-tech company was almost bought by Uber back in June; The ridesharing titan was similarly looking to acqui-hire Luxe's assets and staff, though CEO and cofounder Curtis Lee reportedly wouldn't be making the jump to Uber. But today's deal will see Lee accompany his team to Volvo, according to Luxe's blog post on the matter. Volvo will integrate the valet tech into its own systems in its pursuit of ultimate driver service: \n\"Our vision is a future in which technology simplifies life so you never have to stop at a petrol station, go to a car wash or even take your car in for service ever again. The acquisition of Luxe is a step towards realising that ambition. I look forward to working closely with the highly talented team at Luxe who created its advanced technology from the ground up,\" said Atif Rafiq, Chief Digital Officer at Volvo Cars, in a press release . \nLuxe's tech includes algorithms for routing, logistics planning and arrival time prediction, which will help with unspecified digital services in future Volvo connected cars. Even though most automakers are fixated on developing autonomous systems, some are likewise interested in valet convenience. Daimler recently outfitted its Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, Germany with a self-parking service as a proof-of-concept. ",
