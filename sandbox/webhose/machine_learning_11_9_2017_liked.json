      "text": "Machine learning tackles quantum error correction August 15, 2017 by Lisa Zyga feature The neural decoder architecture. Credit: Torlai et al. ©2017 American Physical Society \n(Phys.org)—Physicists have applied the ability of machine learning algorithms to learn from experience to one of the biggest challenges currently facing quantum computing: quantum error correction, which is used to design noise-tolerant quantum computing protocols. In a new study, they have demonstrated that a type of neural network called a Boltzmann machine can be trained to model the errors in a quantum computing protocol and then devise and implement the best method for correcting the errors. \nThe physicists, Giacomo Torlai and Roger G. Melko at the University of Waterloo and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, have published a paper on the new machine learning algorithm in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters . \n\"The idea behind neural decoding is to circumvent the process of constructing a decoding algorithm for a specific code realization (given some approximations on the noise), and let a neural network learn how to perform the recovery directly from raw data , obtained by simple measurements on the code,\" Torlai told Phys.org . \"With the recent advances in quantum technologies and a wave of quantum devices becoming available in the near term, neural decoders will be able to accommodate the different architectures, as well as different noise sources.\" \nAs the researchers explain, a Boltzmann machine is one of the simplest kinds of stochastic artificial neural networks , and it can be used to analyze a wide variety of data. Neural networks typically extract features and patterns from raw data, which in this case is a data set containing the possible errors that can afflict quantum states. \nOnce the new algorithm, which the physicists call a neural decoder, is trained on this data, it is able to construct an accurate model of the probability distribution of the errors. With this information, the neural decoder can generate the appropriate error chains that can then be used to recover the correct quantum states. \nThe researchers tested the neural decoder on quantum topological codes that are commonly used in quantum computing , and demonstrated that the algorithm is relatively simple to implement. Another advantage of the new algorithm is that it does not depend on the specific geometry, structure, or dimension of the data, which allows it to be generalized to a wide variety of problems. \nIn the future, the physicists plan to explore different ways to improve the algorithm's performance, such as by stacking multiple Boltzmann machines on top of one another to build a network with a deeper structure. The researchers also plan to apply the neural decoder to more complex, realistic codes. \n\"So far, neural decoders have been tested on simple codes typically used for benchmarks,\" Torlai said. \"A first direction would be to perform error correction on codes for which an efficient decoder is yet to be found, for instance Low Density Parity Check codes. On the long term I believe neural decoding will play an important role when dealing with larger quantum systems (hundreds of qubits). The ability to compress high-dimensional objects into low-dimensional representations, from which stems the success of machine learning, will allow to faithfully capture the complex distribution relating the errors arising in the system with the measurements outcomes.\"",

Why machine learning matters Artificial intelligence will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic. The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years. In 2015, Google trained a conversational agent (AI) that could not only convincingly interact with humans as a tech support helpdesk, but also discuss morality, express opinions, and answer general facts-based questions. ( Vinyals & Le, 2017 ) The same year, DeepMind developed an agent that surpassed human-level performance at 49 Atari games, receiving only the pixels and game score as inputs. Soon after, in 2016, DeepMind obsoleted their own achievement by releasing a new state-of-the-art gameplay method called A3C. Meanwhile, AlphaGo defeated one of the best human players at Go — an extraordinary achievement in a game dominated by humans for two decades after machines first conquered chess. Many masters could not fathom how it would be possible for a machine to grasp the full nuance and complexity of this ancient Chinese war strategy game, with its 10¹⁷⁰ possible board positions (there are only 10⁸⁰atoms in the universe ). Professional Go player Lee Sedol reviewing his match with AlphaGo after defeat. Photo via The Atlantic . In March 2017, OpenAI created agents that invented their own language to cooperate and more effectively achieve their goal. Soon after, Facebook reportedly successfully training agents to negotiate and even lie . Just a few days ago (as of this writing), on August 11, 2017, OpenAI reached yet another incredible milestone by defeating the world’s top professionals in 1v1 matches of the online multiplayer game Dota 2. See the full match at The International 2017, with Dendi (human) vs. OpenAI (bot), on YouTube . Much of our day-to-day technology is powered by artificial intelligence. Point your camera at the menu during your next trip to Taiwan and the restaurant’s selections will magically appear in English via the Google Translate app. Google Translate overlaying English translations on a drink menu in real time using convolutional neural networks. Today AI is used to design evidence-based treatment plans for cancer patients, instantly analyze results from medical tests to escalate to the appropriate specialist immediately, and conduct scientific research for drug discovery. A bold proclamation by London-based BenevolentAI (screenshot from About Us page, August 2017). In everyday life, it’s increasingly commonplace to discover machines in roles traditionally occupied by humans. Really, don’t be surprised if a little housekeeping delivery bot shows up instead of a human next time you call the hotel desk to send up some toothpaste. In this series, we’ll explore the core machine learning concepts behind these technologies. By the end, you should be able to describe how they work at a conceptual level and be equipped with the tools to start building similar applications yourself. The semantic tree: artificial intelligence and machine learning One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree  — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to. — Elon Musk, Reddit AMA Machine learning is one of many subfields of artificial intelligence, concerning the ways that computers learn from experience to improve their ability to think, plan, decide, and act. Artificial intelligence is the study of agents that perceive the world around them, form plans, and make decisions to achieve their goals. Its foundations include mathematics, logic, philosophy, probability, linguistics, neuroscience, and decision theory. Many fields fall under the umbrella of AI, such as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence . Its goal is to enable computers to learn on their own. A machine’s learning algorithm enables it to identify patterns in observed data, build models that explain the world, and predict things without having explicit pre-programmed rules and models. The AI effect: what actually qualifies as “artificial intelligence”? The exact standard for technology that qualifies as “AI” is a bit fuzzy, and interpretations change over time. The AI label tends to describe machines doing tasks traditionally in the domain of humans. Interestingly, once computers figure out how to do one of these tasks, humans have a tendency to say it wasn’t really intelligence. This is known as the AI effect . For example, when IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, people complained that it was using \"brute force\" methods and it wasn’t “real” intelligence at all. As Pamela McCorduck wrote, “It’s part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something — play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems — there was chorus of critics to say, ‘that’s not thinking’” ( McCorduck, 2004 ). Perhaps there is a certain je ne sais quoi inherent to what people will reliably accept as “artificial intelligence”: \"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.\" - Douglas Hofstadter So does a calculator count as AI? Maybe by some interpretation. What about a self-driving car? Today, yes. In the future, perhaps not. Your cool new chatbot startup that automates a flow chart? Sure… why not. Strong AI will change our world forever; to understand how, studying machine learning is a good place to start The technologies discussed above are examples of artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) , which can effectively perform a narrowly defined task. Meanwhile, we’re continuing to make foundational advances towards human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI), also known as strong AI . The definition of an AGI is an artificial intelligence that can successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can , including learning, planning and decision-making under uncertainty, communicating in natural language, making jokes, manipulating people, trading stocks, or… reprogramming itself. And this last one is a big deal. Once we create an AI that can improve itself, it will unlock a cycle of recursive self-improvement that could lead to an intelligence explosion over some unknown time period, ranging from many decades to a single day. Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. — I.J. Good, 1965 You may have heard this point referred to as the singularity . The term is borrowed from the gravitational singularity that occurs at the center of a black hole, an infinitely dense one-dimensional point where the laws of physics as we understand them start to break down. We have zero visibility into what happens beyond the event horizon of a black hole because no light can escape. Similarly, after we unlock AI’s ability to recursively improve itself, it’s impossible to predict what will happen, just as mice who intentionally designed a human might have trouble predicting what the human would do to their world. Would it keep helping them get more cheese, as they originally intended? (Image via WIRED ) A recent report by the Future of Humanity Institute surveyed a panel of AI researchers on timelines forAGI, and found that “researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years” ( Grace et al, 2017 ) . We’ve personally spoken with a number of sane and reasonable AI practitioners who predict much longer timelines (the upper limit being “never”), and others whose timelines are alarmingly short — as little as a few years. Image from Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near, published in 2005. Now, in 2017, only a couple of these posters could justifiably remain on the wall. The advent of greater-than-human-level artificial superintelligence (ASI) could be one of the best or worst things to happen to our species.It carries with it the immense challenge of specifying what AIs will want in a way that is friendly to humans. While it’s impossible to say what the future holds, one thing is certain: 2017 is a good time to start understanding how machines think. To go beyond the abstractions of a philosopher in an armchair and intelligently shape our roadmaps and policies with respect to AI, we must engage with the details of how machines see the world — what they “want”, their potential biases and failure modes, their temperamental quirks — just as we study psychology and neuroscience to understand how humans learn, decide, act, and feel. There are complex, high-stakes questions about AI that will require our careful attention in the coming years. How can we combat AI’s propensity to further entrench systemic biases evident in existing data sets? What should we make of fundamental disagreements among the world’s most powerful technologists about the potential risks and benefits of artificial intelligence? What will happen to humans' sense of purpose in a world without work? Machine learning is at the core of our journey towards artificial general intelligence, and in the meantime, it will change every industry and have a massive impact on our day-to-day lives. That’s why we believe it’s worth understanding machine learning, at least at a conceptual level — and we designed this series to be the best place to start. How to read this series You don’t necessarily need to read the series cover-to-cover to get value out of it. Here are three suggestions on how to approach it, depending on your interests and how much time you have: T-shaped approach. Read from beginning to end. Summarize each section in your own words as you go (see: Feynman technique ); this encourages active reading & stronger retention. Go deeper into areas that are most relevant to your interests or work. We’ll include resources for further exploration at the end of each section. Focused approach. Jump straight to the sections you’re most curious about and focus your mental energy there. 80/20 approach . Skim everything in one go, make a few notes on interesting high-level concepts, and call it a night. 😉 About the authors “Ok, we have to be done with gradient descent by the time we finish this ale.” @ The Boozy Cow in Edinburgh Vishal most recently led growth at Upstart , a lending platform that utilizes machine learning to price credit, automate the borrowing process, and acquire users. He spends his time thinking about startups, applied cognitive science, moral philosophy, and the ethics of artificial intelligence. Samer is a Master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at UCSD and co-founder of Conigo Labs . Prior to grad school, he founded TableScribe, a business intelligence tool for SMBs, and spent two years advising Fortune 100 companies at McKinsey. Samer previously studied Computer Science and Ethics, Politics, and Economics at Yale. Most of this series was written during a 10-day trip to the United Kingdom in a frantic blur of trains, planes, cafes, pubs and wherever else we could find a dry place to sit. Our aim was to solidify our own understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and how the methods therein fit together — and hopefully create something worth sharing in the process.

      "text": "Tech giants Google, Microsoft and Facebook are all applying the lessons of machine learning to translation, but a small company called DeepL has outdone them all and raised the bar for the field. Its translation tool is just as quick as the outsized competition, but more accurate and nuanced than any we’ve tried.\nI only speak a smattering of French in addition to my passable English, but luckily my colleague Frederic is a man of many tongues. We both agreed that DeepL’s translations were generally superior to those from Google Translate and Bing.\nTake, for example, the following passage from a German news article, as rendered by DeepL (top) and Google:\nAs Frederic puts it: “Whereas Google Translate often goes for a very literal translation that misses some nuances and idioms (or gets the translation of these idioms dead wrong), DeepL often provides a more natural translation that comes closer to that of a trained translator.”\nThe second sentence is parsed more naturally; the measure is “designed to” accomplish something rather than just doing that thing; the police are “on the road in armoured vehicles” as opposed to merely on them; “martial appearance” may be imperfect (though inspired) but it’s far better than the nonsensical “fighters’ turmoil…had come to the fore.”\nA few tests of my own on some French literature I know well enough to judge had DeepL coming out on top regularly, as well. Fewer errors of tense, intent and agreement, plus a better understanding and deployment of idiom make for a much more readable translation. We thought so, and so did translators in DeepL’s own blind testing. But don’t take anyone else’s word for it — test it out yourself.\nWhile it’s true that meaning can be conveyed successfully despite errors of that class, as evidenced by the utility we’ve all found in even the poorest machine translations, it’s far from guaranteed that anything but the barest facts of will make it through.\nLinguee evolved DeepL was born from the similarly excellent Linguee, a translation tool that has existed for years and, while popular, never quite reached the level of Google Translate — the latter has a huge advantage in brand and position, after all. Linguee’s co-founder, Gereon Frahling, used to work for Google Research but left in 2007 to pursue this new venture.\nThe team has been working with machine learning for years, for tasks adjacent to the core translation, but it was only last year that they began working in earnest on a whole new system and company, both of which would bear the name DeepL.\nIn an email, Frahling told me that the time was ripe: “We have built a neural translation network that incorporates most of the latest developments, to which we added our own ideas.”\nAn enormous database of over a billion translations and queries, plus a method of ground-truthing translations by searching for similar snippets on the web, made for a strong base in the training of the new model. They also put together what they claim is the 23rd most powerful supercomputer in the world, conveniently located in Iceland.\nDevelopments published by universities, research agencies and indeed Linguee’s competitors showed that convolutional neural networks were the way to go, rather than the recurrent neural networks the company had been using previously. Now isn’t really the place to go into the differences between CNNs and RNNs, so it must suffice to say that for accurate translation of long, complex strings of related words, the former is a better bet as long as you can control for its weaknesses.\nFor example, a CNN could roughly be able to be said to tackle one word of the sentence at a time. This becomes a problem when, for instance, as commonly happens, a word at the end of the sentence determines how a word at the beginning of the sentence should be formed. It’s wasteful to go through the whole sentence only to find that the first word the network picked is wrong, and then start over with that knowledge, so DeepL and others in the machine learning field apply “attention mechanisms” that monitor for such potential trip-ups and resolve them before the CNN moves on to the next word or phrase.\nThere are other secret techniques in play, of course, and their result is a translation tool that I personally plan to make my new default. I look forward to seeing the others step up their game.\nFeatured Image: H. Armstrong Roberts/Getty Images/Getty Images 0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "The Mathematics of Machine Learning 21 July 2016 on Machine Learning \nIn the last few months, I have had several people contact me about their enthusiasm for venturing into the world of data science and using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to probe statistical regularities and build impeccable data-driven products. However, I have observed that some actually lack the necessary mathematical intuition and framework to get useful results. This is the main reason I decided to write this blog post. Recently, there has been an upsurge in the availability of many easy-to-use machine and deep learning packages such as scikit-learn , Weka , Tensorflow , R-caret etc. Machine Learning theory is a field that intersects statistical, probabilistic, computer science and algorithmic aspects arising from learning iteratively from data and finding hidden insights which can be used to build intelligent applications. Despite the immense possibilities of Machine and Deep Learning, a thorough mathematical understanding of many of these techniques is necessary for a good grasp of the inner workings of the algorithms and getting good results. \nWhy Worry About The Maths? \nThere are many reasons why the mathematics of Machine Learning is important and I will highlight some of them below: \nSelecting the right algorithm which includes giving considerations to accuracy, training time, model complexity, number of parameters and number of features. \nChoosing parameter settings and validation strategies. \nIdentifying underfitting and overfitting by understanding the Bias-Variance tradeoff. \nEstimating the right confidence interval and uncertainty. \nWhat Level of Maths Do You Need? \nThe main question when trying to understand an interdisciplinary field such as Machine Learning is the amount of maths necessary and the level of maths needed to understand these techniques. The answer to this question is multidimensional and depends on the level and interest of the individual. Research in mathematical formulations and theoretical advancement of Machine Learning is ongoing and some researchers are working on more advance techniques. I will state what I believe to be the minimum level of mathematics needed to be a Machine Learning Scientist/Engineer and the importance of each mathematical concept. \nLinear Algebra : A colleague, Skyler Speakman , recently said that \"Linear Algebra is the mathematics of the 21st century\" and I totally agree with the statement. In ML, Linear Algebra comes up everywhere. Topics such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Eigendecomposition of a matrix, LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition/Factorization, Symmetric Matrices, Orthogonalization & Orthonormalization, Matrix Operations, Projections, Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors, Vector Spaces and Norms are needed for understanding the optimization methods used for machine learning. The amazing thing about Linear Algebra is that there are so many online resources. I have always said that the traditional classroom is dying because of the vast amount of resources available on the internet. My favorite Linear Algebra course is the one offered by MIT Courseware (Prof. Gilbert Strang). \nProbability Theory and Statistics : Machine Learning and Statistics aren't very different fields. Actually, someone recently defined Machine Learning as 'doing statistics on a Mac'. Some of the fundamental Statistical and Probability Theory needed for ML are Combinatorics, Probability Rules & Axioms, Bayes' Theorem, Random Variables, Variance and Expectation, Conditional and Joint Distributions, Standard Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial, Uniform and Gaussian), Moment Generating Functions, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Prior and Posterior, Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP) and Sampling Methods. \nMultivariate Calculus : Some of the necessary topics include Differential and Integral Calculus, Partial Derivatives, Vector-Values Functions, Directional Gradient, Hessian, Jacobian, Laplacian and Lagragian Distribution. \nAlgorithms and Complex Optimizations : This is important for understanding the computational efficiency and scalability of our Machine Learning Algorithm and for exploiting sparsity in our datasets. Knowledge of data structures (Binary Trees, Hashing, Heap, Stack etc), Dynamic Programming, Randomized & Sublinear Algorithm, Graphs, Gradient/Stochastic Descents and Primal-Dual methods are needed. \nOthers : This comprises of other Math topics not covered in the four major areas described above. They include Real and Complex Analysis (Sets and Sequences, Topology, Metric Spaces, Single-Valued and Continuous Functions, Limits, Cauchy Kernel, Fourier Transforms), Information Theory (Entropy, Information Gain), Function Spaces and Manifolds. \nSome online MOOCs and materials for studying some of the Mathematics topics needed for Machine Learning are:",

      "text": "2,414 shares \nDon’t you just hate it when the YouTube clip you’re trying to watch pauses midway to buffer, or drastically lowers the resolution to a pixelated mess? A group of MIT researchers believe they’ve figured out a solution to those annoyances plaguing millions of people a day. \nUsing machine learning, the Pensieve system figures out the optimal algorithm to use for delivering video at the best possible resolution while avoiding buffering breaks, no matter what connection you’re on. \nThat’s kind of what YouTube and Netflix already strive to do, but the researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) say that the systems currently have to make a trade-off between the quality of the video versus how often it has to rebuffer in order to prepare the next segment of the clip for viewing. \nBy using an AI to learn what algorithm works best in various conditions – including, for example, instances when you’re heading into a tunnel where connectivity is sketchy, and when you’re in a crowded area with thousands of other network users – Pensieve is said to cut rebuffering by up to 30 percent. \nThe team says it’s tested its system with just a month’s worth of video content; exposing it to more data, like Netflix’s entire catalog, could help boost its performance even further. The technology could also prove useful in applications like streaming high-resolution VR content. \nThe researchers will present their paper at the upcoming SIGCOMM Conference in Los Angeles, and also plan to open-source the project subsequently.

      "text": "Microsoft built a hardware platform for real-time AI Project Brainwave promises speedy machine learning in the cloud. Save Intel \nIn many cases, you want AI to work with info as it happens. That virtual assistant needs to respond within a few seconds at most, and a smart security camera needs to send an alert while intruders are still within sight. Microsoft knows this very well. It just unveiled its own hardware acceleration platform, Project Brainwave, that promises speedy, real-time AI in the cloud. Thanks to Intel's new Stratix 10 field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip, it can crunch a hefty 39.5 teraflops in machine learning tasks with less than 1 millisecond of latency, and without having to batch tasks together. It can handle complex AI tasks as they're received, in other words. \nIt's considerably more flexible than many of its hard-coded rivals, too. It relies on a 'soft' dynamic neural network processing engine dropped into off-the-shelf FPGA chips where competitors often need their approach locked in from the outset. It can handle Microsoft's own AI framework (Cognitive Toolkit), but it can also work with Google's TensorFlow and other systems. You can build a machine learning system the way you like and expect it to run in real-time, instead of letting the hardware dictate your methods. \nTo no one's surprise, Microsoft plans to make Project Brainwave available through its own Azure cloud services (it's been big on advanced tech in Azure as of late) so that companies can make use of live AI. There's no guarantee it will receive wide adoption, but it's evident that Microsoft doesn't want to cede any ground to Google, Facebook and others that are making a big deal of internet-delivered AI. It's betting that companies will gladly flock to Azure if they know they have more control over how their AI runs. ",

      "text": "John Deere has long been known for its iconic green tractors, combines, balers, and other farming equipment. But in recent years, the Illinois-based agriculture giant has pushed into new, more high-tech and software-based businesses. Late Wednesday, the company announced a bold step in that direction: It is shelling out $305 million for Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Blue River Technology, a developer of crop-spraying equipment that relies on machine learning. “We’ve been working together for about a year and a half, just to make sure that our strategies aligned,” John May, president of agricultural solutions and CIO at Deere, told Fortune. In addition to new technologies, the acquisition gives Deere a 60-person team in the heart of Silicon Valley. (The company also recently opened a small office in San Francisco.) According to May, Deere will build upon the technology and intellectual property developed by Blue River—and, of course, eventually commercialize it and sell it to customers through its global dealer channels. So what exactly is crop-spraying equipment that’s powered by machine learning? Blue River Technology says its products have integrated computer vision (and software smarts) that enables farmers to spray herbicides only where weeds are present. “These [sprayers] are better equipped for individual [weed] variants that we see on farms every single day,” says Lee Redden, co-founder and chief technology officer of Blue River. “It allows you to decrease the amount of herbicide you’re applying.” According to Blue River’s website, the company is also developing a “LettuceBot” for “precision lettuce thinning” and a drone imaging system that collects data from fields. From now on, you can count on those and all other future Blue River products being one color: green. The transaction is expected to close in September.",

      "text": "A new $240 million center at MIT may help advance the field of artificial intelligence by developing novel devices and materials to power the latest machine-learning algorithms. It could, perhaps, also help IBM reclaim its reputation for doing cutting-edge AI.\nThe project, announced by IBM and MIT today, will research new approaches in deep learning, a technique in AI that has led to big advances in areas such as machine vision and voice recognition. But it will also explore completely new computing devices, materials, and physical phenomena, including efforts to harness quantum computers—exotic but potentially very powerful new machines—to make AI even more capable.\n“A lot of innovation is happening using standard silicon and architectures, but what about the devices and the material science?” says Dario Gil , vice president of AI at IBM Research. “It’s an area no one is touching, and it has the potential for orders-of-magnitude improvements.”\nThe center will also look at ways that AI can be more effectively deployed in industries like health care and security. And it will study the economic impact of artificial intelligence and automation, a hugely significant issue for society.\nThe move is significant for MIT. The university was at the forefront of AI research during the 1950s, but the field’s center of gravity has moved westward more recently, with big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge.\nSubscribe to Weekend Reads Our guide to stories in the archives that put technology in perspective.

The company pushed AI forward by developing Deep Blue, a machine that beat the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, in 1997 (see “ How the Chess Was Won ”). The Watson supercomputer that won the game show Jeopardy! in 2010 used cutting-edge machine-learning and natural-language processing techniques. In recent years, however, other companies have stolen the limelight in AI research, and the company has sometimes been accused of overhyping the AI services available under the Watson brand.\nFocusing on hardware, in particular, may be a good way to reboot. Though there has been dramatic progress in AI in recent years, most of it has come thanks to a handful of algorithms, as well as the growing availability of powerful supercomputers and large quantities of training data. Even as new approaches emerge, novel materials and computing architectures offer huge potential to enhance these AI algorithms.\nMost cutting-edge machine learning is done today on conventional computer chips, whether originally designed for graphics processing or custom-made to handle the necessary computations as efficiently as possible. Rethinking chip architectures and the kinds of components used could boost performance significantly. IBM already has a strong research focus on materials science and novel computing devices. “As excited as we all are about AI, the field has multiple decades ahead of it,” Gil says.\n\nRafael Reif, president of MIT (left), and John Kelly, senior vice president of cognitive solutions and research at IBM. One of those opportunities could come from quantum computing. A research curiosity for decades, it is now progressing toward practical machines capable of tackling real problems, particularly in areas like chemical research. Its possible effects on machine learning and AI make for fascinating questions.\nGil says it’s too early to predict how things will pan out, but he believes experimentation could provide some surprises. “That will only occur if you have a darn quantum computer, and that’s what we have,” he say.\nRecommended for You Giving the Dry-Erase Whiteboard a High-Tech Makeover Thermal   Besides hardware advances, the new MIT center will research new kinds of machine-learning algorithms. In particular, it will investigate algorithms that let computers learn from raw, or unlabeled, data and ones that could make it possible to transfer learning from one domain to another.\nAnantha Chandrakasan , dean of MIT’s school of engineering, says research efforts in hardware and software should ideally feed into one another. “We’re not going to be designing algorithms that are completely independent of the architectures we’re going to be using,” he says. “We’ll see system-level thinking.”\nThe lab will also examine how AI can be applied in specific domains, such as health care and computer security. Chandrakasan says he is particularly excited to explore the practical applications of AI, and he hopes the endeavor will spawn new spinout companies in coming years.\nThis area of interest could prove especially important to IBM’s current business. The company has found it more difficult than anticipated to deploy Watson in areas such as health care (see “ A Reality Check for IBM’s AI Ambitions ”).\nFrancesca Rossi of IBM Research on ethics and AI. The collaboration will also pursue research on the implications of AI for global prosperity. Francesca Rossi, a distinguished research scientist at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, says that project will dovetail with the work on AI algorithms. “To advance shared prosperity through AI, you also need to advance the AI algorithms you would use,” she says. \nIn its focus on using AI to deliver economic and societal benefits, the effort overlaps in some ways with the Partnership on AI , a consortium that IBM helped found in September 2016 to study how AI is influencing society. But Rossi says the MIT-IBM collaboration will produce research, while the Partnership provides an open platform for discussing these issues. For example, the Partnership on AI might recommend that every AI system be able to explain itself, as a general guideline. But AI experts still don’t understand how algorithms make decisions (see “ The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI ”). MIT and IBM could devise ways to address this conundrum by working together, says Rossi.\nHear more about artificial intelligence at EmTech MIT 2017.\nRegister now \n\n\nRafael Reif, president of MIT (left), and John Kelly, senior vice president of cognitive solutions and research at IBM.",

      "text": "Machines Taught by Photos Learn a Sexist View of Women HOTLITTLEPOTATO \nLast fall, University of Virginia computer science professor Vicente Ordóñez noticed a pattern in some of the guesses made by image-recognition software he was building. “It would see a picture of a kitchen and more often than not associate it with women, not men,” he says. \nThat got Ordóñez wondering whether he and other researchers were unconsciously injecting biases into their software. So he teamed up with colleagues to test two large collections of labeled photos used to “train” image-recognition software. \nTheir results are illuminating. Two prominent research-image collections—including one supported by Microsoft and Facebook—display a predictable gender bias in their depiction of activities such as cooking and sports. Images of shopping and washing are linked to women, for example, while coaching and shooting are tied to men. \nMachine-learning software trained on the datasets didn’t just mirror those biases, it amplified them. If a photo set generally associated women with cooking, software trained by studying those photos and their labels created an even stronger association. \nMark Yatskar, a researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, says that this phenomenon could also amplify other biases in data, for example related to race. “This could work to not only reinforce existing social biases but actually make them worse,” says Yatskar, who worked with Ordóñez and others on the project while at the University of Washington. \nAs sophisticated machine-learning programs proliferate, such distortions matter. In the researchers' tests, people pictured in kitchens, for example, became even more likely to be labeled “woman” than reflected the training data. The researchers’ paper includes a photo of a man at a stove labeled “woman.” \nIf replicated in tech companies, these problems could affect photo-storage services, in-home assistants with cameras like the Amazon Look, or tools that use social media photos to discern consumer preferences. Google accidentally demonstrated the dangers of inappropriate image software in 2015, when its photo service tagged black people as gorillas . Business Agencies decline to release information about algorithms used for criminal justice, social welfare, and education. the web A slur recently showed up on Google Maps, and it was the work of trolls. It was the work of algorithms. WIRED Opinion \nHow to Keep Your AI From Turning Into a Racist Monster Opinion: Algorithmic bias can turn bots into beasts. Tech can help. \nAs AI-based systems take on more complex tasks, the stakes will become higher. Yatskar describes a future robot that when unsure of what someone is doing in the kitchen offers a man a beer and a woman help washing dishes. \"A system that takes action that can be clearly attributed to gender bias cannot effectively function with people,\" he says. \nTech companies have come to lean heavily on software that learns from piles of data, after breakthroughs in machine learning roughly five years ago. More recently, researchers have begun to show how techniques considered cold and clinical can pick up unsavory biases . \nLast summer, researchers from Boston University and Microsoft showed that software trained on text collected from Google News reproduced gender biases well documented in humans. When they asked software to complete the statement “Man is to computer programmer as woman is to X ,” it replied, “homemaker.” \nThe new study shows that gender bias is built into two big sets of photos, released to help software better understand the content of images. The researchers looked at ImSitu , created by the University of Washington, and COCO , initially coordinated by Microsoft, and now also cosponsored by Facebook and startup MightyAI. Each collection contains more than 100,000 images of complex scenes drawn from the web, labeled with descriptions. \nBoth datasets contain many more images of men than women, and the objects and activities depicted with different genders show what the researchers call “significant” gender bias. In the COCO dataset, kitchen objects such as spoons and forks are strongly associated with women, while outdoor sporting equipment such as snowboards and tennis rackets are strongly associated with men. \nWhen image-recognition software is “trained” by examining these datasets, the bias is amplified. A system trained on the COCO dataset associated men with keyboards and computer mice even more strongly than the dataset itself. \nThe researchers devised a way to neutralize this amplification phenomenon—effectively forcing learning software to reflect its training data. But it requires a researcher to be looking for bias in the first place, and to specify what he or she wants to correct. And the corrected software still reflects the gender biases baked into the original data. \nEric Horvitz, director of Microsoft Research, says he hopes others adopt such tools as they build software powered by machine learning. The company has an internal ethics committee dedicated to keeping AI in the company's products in line. “I and Microsoft as a whole celebrate efforts identifying and addressing bias and gaps in datasets and systems created out of them,” Horvitz says. Researchers and engineers working with COCO and other datasets should be looking for signs of bias in their own work and others’ he says. \nAway from computers, books and other educational materials for children often are tweaked to show an idealized world, with equal numbers of men and women construction workers, for example. Horvitz says it may be worth considering a similar approach in some cases for material used to teach software about the world. “It’s a really important question--when should we change reality to make our systems perform in an aspirational way?” he says. \nOthers studying bias in machine learning aren't so sure. If there really are more male construction workers, image-recognition programs should be allowed to see that, says Aylin Caliskan, a researcher at Princeton. Steps can be taken afterwards to measure and adjust any bias if needed. “We risk losing essential information,” she says. “The datasets need to reflect the real statistics in the world.” \nOne point of agreement in the field is that using machine learning to solve problems is more complicated than many people previously thought. “Work like this is correcting the illusion that algorithms can be blindly applied to solve problems,” says Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor at the University of Utah.

      "text": "Google releases millions of bad drawings for you (and your AI) to paw through Posted Facebook hires former NYT public editor Liz Spayd to consult on transparency Back in November, Google showcased a few of its funky machine learning experiments , and among them was Quick, Draw! (their bang, not mine) — a game where you sketch something and an image recognition system guesses what it is. Now the company is releasing the millions upon millions of sketches players submitted as an open data set for AI developers to play with. \nNow, if the prospect of browsing through a bunch (I’m talking 50 million here) of terrible drawings of hats, shoes, and cats doesn’t sound like fun to you, don’t worry. That’s not really the point. \nReally it’s about the metadata. Those drawings came from lots of different countries, and it’s fun to check out how differently, say, Germany and Korea think of cats. Or chairs! \nOh. \nWell look, there are patterns in there worth sussing out. Clearly Korean and Russian sketchers were more likely to draw the chair at an angle or sideways. Why? That’s what you’re supposed to find out with your machine learning system! \nThere are actually lots of interesting differences. As Google’s post points out, a bias appeared toward the sneaker-type shoe, so much so that the system would have trouble recognizing a high heel or sandal. And what about cats? Surely there are sub-cat-egories of how people chose to draw them. I think I did one, actually, and I drew the whole cat. Am I some strange, handsome exception? If only I knew how to create a machine learning system to find out (hint). \nGoogle suggests you use their new Facets tool to visualize the enormous amount of data in the set. And that’s really the interesting part of this whole thing. When you have data sets this big — in the hundreds of millions of examples — how can you sort it and observe it even at a gross level so that people can find coarse patterns and ideas worth pursuing? And how can you spot things like systematic biases or opportunities for improvement? \nThe 50 million drawings are just a start — the other 750 million or so will be released over time, and presumably interesting data from other projects as well. Keep an eye on the Google Research blog (or TechCrunch, obviously) for the latest. Featured Image: Google Research ",

      "text": "How Machine Learning Advances Will Improve the Fairness of Algorithms 08/23/2017 10:36 am ET 640 \nBy Jennifer T. Chayes, Distinguished Scientist and Managing Director, Microsoft Research, and ACM Fellow \nMachine learning (ML) is a subfield of computer science in which algorithms learn by recognizing patterns in data. For example, our personal assistants, like Cortana, Siri, and Alexa, learn how to recognize what we are saying and how best to respond to our questions by using lots of data from interactions with many millions of people. \nAs computers become more “intelligent,” some data scientists have been puzzled as they’ve observed their algorithms being sexist or racist. This shouldn’t be surprising, these algorithms were trained with social data that reflect society’s biases, and algorithms amplify these biases to improve their performance metrics. \nFor example, if one naively trains an ML algorithm to filter resumes and find the most qualified candidates for certain jobs based on data on prior hires, even if the algorithm is explicitly instructed to ignore “protected attributes” like race or gender, the results can turn out to be race- or gender-biased. It turns out that race and gender are correlated with other “unprotected” information like names, which the naive algorithm can use. In hiring, people are known to do the same—they are not told the gender of the applicant, but they recognize a female name and don’t interview her since most of their previous hires are male. \nIn general, with careful algorithm design, computers can be fairer than typical human decision-makers, despite the biased training data. Just as we teach our children that anyone has the potential to have any job despite whom they see working in those jobs, we can teach intelligent algorithms how to disregard these discriminatory biases in their training data. Fortunately, as computers become smarter it is also easier to teach them. They understand what race and gender are, and the social data can also be used to automatically uncover and remove biases. \nCurrent systems sometimes have significant biases. When Harvard Professor Latanya Sweeney put her name into a search engine, she was delivered an ad saying “Latanya Sweeney, Arrested?” and offered a background check for a fee. The result of that background check was that Dr. Sweeney had no arrest record, as is the case for most distinguished scientists. This ad is obviously deeply unfair and discriminatory to Dr. Sweeney. If potential employers put Dr. Sweeney’s name into a search engine, they might write her off immediately upon seeing the ad. Moreover, Dr. Sweeney showed that searching on people whose first names indicated they were more likely to be black, like Latanya, was much more likely to produce this “Arrested? ad” than searching on racially neutral names. \nThe good news is that we have many computer scientists who care deeply about the fairness of ML algorithms, and have developed methods to make them less biased than humans. A few years ago, a group of researchers at Microsoft Research and Boston University uncovered gender discrimination inherent in certain linguistic tools used in many search engines. When used to complete the analogy “man is to computer programmer as woman is to ___,” this tool produced the answer “homemaker.” Our team debiased this tool so that it delivered gender neutral results, making it less biased than humans. \nA group of researchers at Microsoft Research and Harvard recently designed an intelligent algorithm which looks directly at “protected attributes” like race or gender at an intermediate stage, and produces decisions that are sometimes less biased than human judgements. Consider a hypothetical hiring decision for a new management position in my organization. Our naive hiring algorithm learns characteristics associated with our good past managers, and recommends applicants with those characteristics. Let’s say it finds that having a break in employment history before we hire someone is negatively correlated with being a good manager. Since most of the managers in my data are male, what this probably means is that men with breaks in employment history turned out to be worse in our management jobs. \nNow let’s think about women. It could be that most women who take a few years off are raising children and, in the process, learning how to juggle a lot of competing priorities—something which makes them better managers when they return to the workforce. But the naive algorithm doesn’t see that in the data since it’s overwhelmed by the preponderance of data on men. Our researchers showed that if they apply the naive algorithm separately for different protected groups, it is often less biased in its decision-making. In this case, it would result in not penalizing women who had a break in employment history and were seeking management jobs. Using gender in hiring decisions is not allowed by current law, but this result could inform future regulation. \nSome people think debiasing algorithms is inherently impossible, but like self-driving cars which will inevitably get in accidents, the first step is to design systems that are safer or less biased than their human counterparts. The process of mathematically defining “fair” decision-making metrics also forces us to pin down tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy that must be faced and have sometimes been swept under the carpet by policy-makers. It makes us rethink what it really means to treat all groups equally—in some cases equal treatment may only be possible by learning different group-specific criteria. \nThere is an entirely new field emerging at the intersection of computer science, law, and ethics. It will not only lead to fairer algorithms, but also to algorithms which track accountability, and make clear which factors contributed to a decision. There’s much reason to be hopeful!

      "text": "How to Keep Your AI From Turning Into a Racist Monster As AI-based systems take on more complex tasks, the stakes will become higher. Yatskar describes a future robot that when unsure of what someone is doing in the kitchen offers a man a beer and a woman help washing dishes. \"A system that takes action that can be clearly attributed to gender bias cannot effectively function with people,\" he says. Tech companies have come to lean heavily on software that learns from piles of data, after breakthroughs in machine learning roughly five years ago. More recently, researchers have begun to show how techniques considered cold and clinical can pick up unsavory biases . Last summer, researchers from Boston University and Microsoft showed that software trained on text collected from Google News reproduced gender biases well documented in humans. When they asked software to complete the statement “Man is to computer programmer as woman is to X ,” it replied, “homemaker.” The new study shows that gender bias is built into two big sets of photos, released to help software better understand the content of images. The researchers looked at ImSitu , created by the University of Washington, and COCO , initially coordinated by Microsoft, and now also cosponsored by Facebook and startup MightyAI. Each collection contains more than 100,000 images of complex scenes drawn from the web, labeled with descriptions. Both datasets contain many more images of men than women, and the objects and activities depicted with different genders show what the researchers call “significant” gender bias. In the COCO dataset, kitchen objects such as spoons and forks are strongly associated with women, while outdoor sporting equipment such as snowboards and tennis rackets are strongly associated with men. When image-recognition software is “trained” by examining these datasets, the bias is amplified. A system trained on the COCO dataset associated men with keyboards and computer mice even more strongly than the dataset itself. The researchers devised a way to neutralize this amplification phenomenon—effectively forcing learning software to reflect its training data. But it requires a researcher to be looking for bias in the first place, and to specify what he or she wants to correct. And the corrected software still reflects the gender biases baked into the original data. Eric Horvitz, director of Microsoft Research, says he hopes others adopt such tools as they build software powered by machine learning. The company has an internal ethics committee dedicated to keeping AI in the company's products in line. “I and Microsoft as a whole celebrate efforts identifying and addressing bias and gaps in datasets and systems created out of them,” Horvitz says. Researchers and engineers working with COCO and other datasets should be looking for signs of bias in their own work and others’ he says. Away from computers, books and other educational materials for children often are tweaked to show an idealized world, with equal numbers of men and women construction workers, for example. Horvitz says it may be worth considering a similar approach in some cases for material used to teach software about the world. “It’s a really important question–when should we change reality to make our systems perform in an aspirational way?” he says. Others studying bias in machine learning aren't so sure. If there really are more male construction workers, image-recognition programs should be allowed to see that, says Aylin Caliskan, a researcher at Princeton. Steps can be taken afterwards to measure and adjust any bias if needed. “We risk losing essential information,” she says. “The datasets need to reflect the real statistics in the world.” One point of agreement in the field is that using machine learning to solve problems is more complicated than many people previously thought. “Work like this is correcting the illusion that algorithms can be blindly applied to solve problems,” says Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor at the University of Utah.

      "text": "Amazon isn’t synonymous with high fashion yet, but the company may be poised to lead the way when it comes to replacing stylists and designers with ever-so-chic AI algorithms.\nResearchers at the e-commerce juggernaut are currently working on several machine-learning systems that could help provide an edge when it comes to spotting, reacting to, and perhaps even shaping the latest fashion trends. The effort points to ways in which Amazon and other companies could try to improve the tracking of trends in other areas of retail—making recommendations based on products popping up in social-media posts, for instance. And it could help the company expand its clothing business or even dominate the area.\n“There’s been a whole move from companies like Amazon trying to understand how fashion develops in the world,” says Kavita Bala , a professor at Cornell University who took part in a workshop on machine learning and fashion organized by Amazon last week. “This is completely changing the industry.”\nA number of forward-thinking retailers are already using social networks like Instagram and Pinterest to track the latest fashion trends and react quickly. And startups like the subscription service Stitch Fix already make personalized recommendations based on user preferences and social-media activity.\nRelated Story\n50 Smartest Companies 2017 Our editors pick the 50 companies that best combine innovative technology with an effective business model. Amazon, meanwhile, is making moves to bolster its apparel business, developing its own clothing brands, investing in high-quality photography for products, and launching Prime Wardrobe, which lets customers try on clothes before buying them. Its Echo Look app will even give you feedback on your outfits.\nBut Amazon appears to be pushing that algorithmic approach even further. For instance, one group of Amazon researchers based in Israel developed machine learning that, by analyzing just a few labels attached to images, can deduce whether a particular look can be considered stylish. The software could conceivably provide fashion feedback or recommendations for adjustments. The work is innovative because computers usually require extensive labeling in order to learn from visual information. But in many real-world situations, such as an image posted to Instagram, there might be just one label.\nAn Amazon team at Lab126, a research center based in San Francisco, has developed an algorithm that learns about a particular style of fashion from images, and can then generate new items in similar styles from scratch—essentially, a simple AI fashion designer. The approach is crude and hardly ready for Project Runway , but it hints at the possibilities.\nSubscribe to Weekend Reads Our guide to stories in the archives that put technology in perspective.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences This work uses a cutting-edge tool called a generative adversarial network, or GAN. It consists of two deep neural networks operating in tandem to learn efficiently from raw data. The GAN internalizes the properties of a particular style simply by looking at lots of examples, and it can then apply that style to an existing item of clothing. GANs, which were developed by a researcher on the Google Brain team, are a hot topic in machine learning today (see “ Innovators Under 35: Ian Goodfellow ”).\nBoth these projects were revealed at the workshop organized by Amazon. The event included mostly academic researchers who are exploring ways for machines to understand fashion trends. The company declined to comment on the projects.\nRecommended for You Giving the Dry-Erase Whiteboard a High-Tech Makeover Thermal Imaging Aims to Give Autonomous Cars Better Night Vision Uber Is Ditching Diesel in London I Tried Shoplifting in a Store without Cashiers and Here’s What Happened Amazon Is Investing $5 Billion to Build a Second American HQ Some at the workshop showed how the techniques being developed to track fashion trends could provide broader insights into human behavior. Bala and her colleagues are using information gleaned from Instagram as a form of anthropological research. “We’re trying to understand how people live their daily lives,” she says. “It really is unprecedented in human history that we have this extent of visual records.”\nOthers are exploring ideas that could feed directly into people’s closets. A group from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign demonstrated an algorithm for identifying fashion-focused social-network accounts. A team from the Indian clothing site Myntra showed a program that guesses a person’s correct size for a particular garment from his or her past purchases.\nTim Oates , a professor at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, presented details of a system for transferring a particular style from one garment to another. He suggests that this approach might be used to conjure up new items of clothing from scratch. “You could train [an algorithm] on your closet, and then you could say here’s a jacket or a pair of pants, and I’d like to adapt it to my style,” Oates says.\nFashion designers probably shouldn’t fret just yet, though. Oates and other point out that it may be a long time before a machine can invent a fashion trend. “People innovate in areas like music, fashion, and cinema,” he says. “What we haven’t seen is a genuinely new music or fashion style that was generated by a computer and really resonated with people.”\nThat may be so, but when it comes to fashion-forward algorithms, evidently Jeff Bezos likes what he sees.\nHear more about artificial intelligence at EmTech MIT 2017.\nRegister now",

      "text": "Google and ProPublica team up to build a national hate crime database Posted TechCrunch’s Original Content takes on ‘The Defenders’ Few things are certain in 2017’s fraught national climate, but hate certainly doesn’t look to be going away . In partnership with ProPublica, Google News Lab is launching a new tool to track hate crimes across America. Powered by machine learning, the Documenting Hate News Index will track reported hate crimes across all 50 states, collecting data from February 2017 onward. \nData visualization studio Pitch Interactive helped craft the index, which collects Google News results and filters them through Google’s natural language analysis to extract geographic and contextual information. Because they are not catalogued in any kind of formal national database, a fact that inspired the creation of the index to begin with, Google calls the project a “starting point” for the documentation and study of hate crimes. While the FBI is legally required to document hate crimes at the federal level, state and local authorities often fail to report their own incidents, making the data incomplete at best. \n“It is one of the first visualisations to use machine learning to generate its content using the Google Natural Language API, which analyses text and extracts information about people, places, and events,” Google News Lab Data editor Simon Rogers writes in the announcement. “In this case, it helps reporters by digging out locations, names and other useful data from the 3,000-plus news reports – the feed is updated every day, and goes back to February 2017.” \nThe initiative is a data-rich new arm of the Documenting Hate project which collects and verifies hate incidents reported by both individual contributors and by news organizations. The Hate News Index will keep an eye out for false positives (casual uses of the word “hate” for example), striking a responsible balance between machine learning and human curation on a very sensitive subject. Hate events will be mapped onto a calendar in the user interface, though users can also use a keyword search or browse through algorithmic suggestions. For anyone who’d like to take the data in a new direction, Google will open sourced its data set, making it available through GitHub . \nThe project’s hope is that journalists can harness its combination of visualized data and news indexing to report more effectively on the aggregate data and incidents that might otherwise fall through the cracks.

      "title": "Microsoft unveils Brainwave, a system for running super-fast AI",
      "text": "August 22, 2017 12:00 PM Image Credit: Intel \nMicrosoft made a splash in the world of dedicated AI hardware today when it unveiled a new system for doing high-speed, low-latency serving of machine learning models. The company showed off a new system called Brainwave that will allow developers to deploy machine learning models onto programmable silicon and achieve high performance beyond what they’d be able to get from a CPU or GPU. \nResearchers at the Hot Chips conference in Cupertino, California showed a Gated Recurrent Unit model running on Intel’s new Stratix 10 field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip at a speed of 39.5 teraflops, without batching operations at all. The lack of batching means that it’s possible for the hardware to handle requests as they come in, providing real-time insights for machine learning systems. \nThe model that Microsoft chose is several times larger than convolutional neural networks like Alexnet and Resnet-50, which other companies have used to benchmark their own hardware. \nProviding low-latency insights is important for deploying machine learning systems at scale. Users don’t want to wait long for their apps to respond. \n“We call it real-time AI because the idea here is that you send in a request, you want the answer back,” said Doug Burger, a distinguished engineer with Microsoft Research. “If it’s a video stream, if it’s a conversation, if it’s looking for intruders, anomaly detection, all the things where you care about interaction and quick results, you want those in real time,” he said. \nHowever, some previously published results on hardware-accelerated machine learning have focused on results that optimize for throughput at the cost of latency. In Burger’s view, more people should ask how a machine learning accelerator can perform without bundling requests into a batch and processing them all at once. \n“All of the numbers [other] people are throwing around are juiced,” he said. \nMicrosoft is using Brainwave across the army of FPGAs it has installed in its data centers. According to Burger, Brainwave will allow Microsoft services to more rapidly support artificial intelligence features. In addition, the company is working to make Brainwave available to third-party customers through its Azure cloud platform. \nFPGAs let programmers configure hardware optimized to execute particular functions prior to runtime, like doing the math necessary to serve insights from neural networks. Microsoft has deployed hundreds of thousands of FPGAs in its data centers on boards that are slotted into servers and connected to the network. \nBrainwave loads a trained machine learning model into FPGA hardware’s memory that stays there throughout the lifetime of a machine learning service. That hardware can then be used to compute whatever insights the model is designed to generate, such as a predicted string of text. In the event that a model is too big to run on a single FPGA, software deploys and executes it across multiple hardware boards. \nMicrosoft isn’t the only company investing in hardware that’s supposed to accelerate machine learning. Google announced the second revision of its Tensor Processing Unit — a dedicated chip for machine learning training and serving — earlier this year. There are also a slew of startups building dedicated hardware accelerators for use with machine learning. \nOne of the common criticisms of FPGAs is that they are less fast or less efficient than chips made specifically to execute machine learning operations. Burger said that this performance milestone should show that the programmable hardware can deliver high performance as well. \nIn addition, the performance displayed today is running on brand new hardware, and Burger said that there’s room for Intel and Microsoft to further optimize both the hardware’s performance and Brainwave’s use of it. With further performance improvements, it should be possible for Microsoft to hit 90 teraflops with the Intel Stratix 10. \nRight now, Brainwave supports trained models created using Microsoft’s CNTK framework and Google’s TensorFlow framework. Burger said that the team is working on making it compatible with other tools like Caffe. Microsoft hasn’t given a roadmap for when it will make Brainwave available to its customers, but is working towards a future when third parties would be able to bring any trained model and run it on Brainwave.

      "text": "\nPhoto by Aaron Burson The buzz over artificial intelligence (AI) has grown loud enough to penetrate the C-suites of organizations around the world, and for good reason. Investment in AI is growing and is increasingly coming from organizations outside the tech space. And AI success stories are becoming more numerous and diverse, from Amazon reaping operational efficiencies using its AI-powered Kiva warehouse robots, to GE keeping its industrial equipment running by leveraging AI for predictive maintenance.\nWhile it’s clear that CEOs need to consider AI’s business implications, the technology’s nascence in business settings makes it less clear how to profitably employ it. Through a study of AI that included a survey of 3,073 executives and 160 case studies across 14 sectors and 10 countries, and through a separate digital research program , we have identified 10 key insights CEOs need to know to embark on a successful AI journey.\nDon’t believe the hype: Not every business is using AI… yet.  While investment in AI is heating up, corporate adoption of AI technologies is still lagging. Total investment (internal and external) in AI reached somewhere in the range of $26 billion to $39 billion in 2016, with external investment tripling since 2013. Despite this level of investment, however, AI adoption is in its infancy, with just 20% of our survey respondents using one or more AI technologies at scale or in a core part of their business, and only half of those using three or more. (Our results are weighted to reflect the relative economic importance of firms of different sizes. We include five categories of AI technology systems: robotics and autonomous vehicles, computer vision, language, virtual agents, and machine learning.)\nFor the moment, this is good news for those companies still experimenting or piloting AI (41%). Our results suggest there’s still time to climb the learning curve and compete using AI.\nHowever, we are likely at a key inflection point of AI adoption. AI technologies like neural-based machine learning and natural language processing are beginning to mature and prove their value, quickly becoming centerpieces of AI technology suites among adopters. And we expect at least a portion of current AI piloters to fully integrate AI in the near term. Finally, adoption appears poised to spread, albeit at different rates, across sectors and domains. Telecom and financial services are poised to lead the way, with respondents in these sectors planning to increase their AI tech spend by more than 15% a year — seven percentage points higher than the cross-industry average — in the next three years.\nBelieve the hype that AI can potentially boost your top and bottom line.  Thirty percent of early AI adopters in our survey — those using AI at scale or in core processes — say they’ve achieved revenue increases, leveraging AI in efforts to gain market share or expand their products and services. Furthermore, early AI adopters are 3.5 times more likely than others to say they expect to grow their profit margin by up to five points more than industry peers. While the question of correlation versus causation can be legitimately raised, a separate analysis uncovered some evidence that AI is already directly improving profits, with ROI on AI investment in the same range as associated digital technologies such as big data and advanced analytics .\nWithout support from leadership, your AI transformation might not succeed.  Successful AI adopters have strong executive leadership support for the new technology. Survey respondents from firms that have successfully deployed an AI technology at scale tend to rate C-suite support as being nearly twice as high as those companies that have not adopted any AI technology. They add that strong support comes not only from the CEO and IT executives but also from all other C-level officers and the board of directors.\nYou don’t have to go it alone on AI — partner for capability and capacity.  With the AI field recently picking up its pace of innovation after the decades-long “AI winter,” technical expertise and capabilities are in short supply. Even large digital natives such as Amazon and Google have turned to companies and talent outside their confines to beef up their AI skills. Consider, for example, Google’s acquisition of DeepMind, which is using its machine learning chops to help the tech giant improve even core businesses like search optimization. Our survey, in fact, showed that early AI adopters have primarily bought the right fit-for-purpose technology solutions, with only a minority of respondents both developing and implementing all AI solutions in-house.\nResist the temptation to put technology teams solely in charge of AI initiatives.  Compartmentalizing accountability for AI with functional leaders in IT, digital, or innovation can result in a hammer-in-search-of-a-nail outcome: technologies being launched without compelling use cases. To ensure a focus on the most valuable use cases, AI initiatives should be assessed and co-led by both business and technical leaders, an approach that has proved successful in the adoption of other digital technologies.\nTake a portfolio approach to accelerate your AI journey.  AI tools today vary along a spectrum ranging from tools that have been proven to solve business problems (for example, pattern detection for predictive maintenance) to those with low awareness and currently-limited-but-high-potential utility (for example, application of AI to developing competitive strategy). This distribution suggests that organizations could consider a portfolio-based approach to AI adoption across three time horizons:\nShort-term: Focus on use cases where there are proven technology solutions today, and scale them across the organization to drive meaningful bottom-line value.\nMedium-term: Experiment with technology that’s emerging but still relatively immature (deep learning video recognition) to prove their value in key business use cases before scaling.\nLong-term: Work with academia or a third party to solve a high-impact use case (augmented human decision making in a key knowledge worker role, for example) with bleeding-edge AI technology to potentially capture a sizable first-mover advantage.\nMachine learning is a powerful tool, but it’s not right for everything.  Machine learning and its most prominent subfield, deep learning, have attracted a lot of media attention and received a significant share of the financing that has been pouring into the AI universe, garnering nearly 60% of all investments from outside the industry in 2016.\nBut while machine learning has many applications, it is just one of many AI-related technologies capable of solving business problems. There’s no one-size-fits-all AI solution. For example, the AI techniques implemented to improve customer call center performance could be very different from the technology used to identify credit card payments fraud . It’s critical to look for the right tool to solve each value-creating business problem at a particular stage in an organization’s digital and AI journey.\nDigital capabilities come before AI.  We found that industries leading in AI adoption — such as high-tech, telecom, and automotive  — are also the ones that are the most digitized. Likewise, within any industry the companies that are early adopters of AI have already invested in digital capabilities, including cloud infrastructure and big data. In fact, it appears that companies can’t easily leapfrog to AI without digital transformation experience . Using a battery of statistics, we found that the odds of generating profit from using AI are 50% higher for companies that have strong experience in digitization.\nBe bold.  In a separate study on digital disruption, we found that adopting an offensive digital strategy was the most important factor in enabling incumbent companies to reverse the curse of digital disruption. An organization with an offensive strategy radically adapts its portfolio of businesses, developing new business models to build a growth path that is more robust than before digitization. So far, the same seems to hold true for AI: Early AI adopters with a very proactive, strictly offensive strategy report a much better profit outlook than those without one.\nThe biggest challenges are people and processes.  In many cases, the change-management challenges of incorporating AI into employee processes and decision making far outweigh technical AI implementation challenges. As leaders determine the tasks machines should handle, versus those that humans perform, both new and traditional, it will be critical to implement programs that allow for constant reskilling of the workforce. And as AI continues to converge with advanced visualization, collaboration, and design thinking, businesses will need to shift from a primary focus on process efficiency to a focus on decision management effectiveness, which will further require leaders to create a culture of continuous improvement and learning.\nMake no mistake: The next digital frontier is here, and it’s AI. While some firms are still reeling from previous digital disruptions, a new one is taking shape. But it’s early days. There’s still time to make AI a competitive advantage.\n",

Share Leave a comment \nIBM and MIT today announced that IBM plans to make a 10-year, $240 million investment to create the MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab in partnership with MIT. The lab will carry out fundamental artificial intelligence (AI) research and seek to propel scientific breakthroughs that unlock the potential of AI. The collaboration aims to advance AI hardware, software, and algorithms related to deep learning and other areas; increase AI’s impact on industries, such as health care and cybersecurity; and explore the economic and ethical implications of AI on society. IBM’s $240 million investment in the lab will support research by IBM and MIT scientists. \nThe new lab will be one of the largest long-term university-industry AI collaborations to date, mobilizing the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors, and students to pursue joint research at IBM's Research Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts — co-located with the IBM Watson Health and IBM Security headquarters in Kendall Square — and on the neighboring MIT campus. \nThe lab will be co-chaired by Dario Gil, IBM Research VP of AI and IBM Q, and Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering. (Read a related Q&A with Chandrakasan.) IBM and MIT plan to issue a call for proposals to MIT researchers and IBM scientists to submit their ideas for joint research to push the boundaries in AI science and technology in several areas, including: AI algorithms: Developing advanced algorithms to expand capabilities in machine learning and reasoning. Researchers will create AI systems that move beyond specialized tasks to tackle more complex problems and benefit from robust, continuous learning. Researchers will invent new algorithms that can not only leverage big data when available, but also learn from limited data to augment human intelligence. Physics of AI: Investigating new AI hardware materials, devices, and architectures that will support future analog computational approaches to AI model training and deployment, as well as the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. The latter involves using AI to help characterize and improve quantum devices, and researching the use of quantum computing to optimize and speed up machine-learning algorithms and other AI applications. Application of AI to industries: Given its location in IBM Watson Health and IBM Security headquarters in Kendall Square, a global hub of biomedical innovation, the lab will develop new applications of AI for professional use, including fields such as health care and cybersecurity. The collaboration will explore the use of AI in areas such as the security and privacy of medical data, personalization of health care, image analysis, and the optimum treatment paths for specific patients. Advancing shared prosperity through AI : The MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab will explore how AI can deliver economic and societal benefits to a broader range of people, nations, and enterprises. The lab will study the economic implications of AI and investigate how AI can improve prosperity and help individuals achieve more in their lives. \nIn addition to IBM’s plan to produce innovations that advance the frontiers of AI, a distinct objective of the new lab is to encourage MIT faculty and students to launch companies that will focus on commercializing AI inventions and technologies that are developed at the lab. The lab’s scientists also will publish their work, contribute to the release of open source material, and foster an adherence to the ethical application of AI. \n“The field of artificial intelligence has experienced incredible growth and progress over the past decade. Yet today’s AI systems, as remarkable as they are, will require new innovations to tackle increasingly difficult real-world problems to improve our work and lives,” says John Kelly III, IBM senior vice president, Cognitive Solutions and Research. “The extremely broad and deep technical capabilities and talent at MIT and IBM are unmatched, and will lead the field of AI for at least the next decade.” \n“I am delighted by this new collaboration,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif says. “True breakthroughs are often the result of fresh thinking inspired by new kinds of research teams. The combined MIT and IBM talent dedicated to this new effort will bring formidable power to a field with staggering potential to advance knowledge and help solve important challenges.” \nBoth MIT and IBM have been pioneers in artificial intelligence research, and the new AI lab builds on a decades-long research relationship between the two. In 2016, IBM Research announced a multiyear collaboration with MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences to advance the scientific field of machine vision, a core aspect of artificial intelligence. The collaboration has brought together leading brain, cognitive, and computer scientists to conduct research in the field of unsupervised machine understanding of audio-visual streams of data, using insights from next-generation models of the brain to inform advances in machine vision. In addition, IBM and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have established a five-year, $50 million research collaboration on AI and genomics. \nMIT researchers were among those who helped coin and popularize the very phrase “artificial intelligence” in the 1950s. MIT pushed several major advances in the subsequent decades, from neural networks to data encryption to quantum computing to crowdsourcing. Marvin Minsky, a founder of the discipline, collaborated on building the first artificial neural network and he, along with Seymour Papert, advanced learning algorithms. Currently, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Media Lab, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society serve as connected hubs for AI and related research at MIT. \nFor more than 20 years, IBM has explored the application of AI across many areas and industries. IBM researchers invented and built Watson, which is a cloud-based AI platform being used by businesses, developers, and universities to fight cancer, improve classroom learning, minimize pollution, enhance agriculture and oil and gas exploration, better manage financial investments, and much more. Today, IBM scientists across the globe are working on fundamental advances in AI algorithms, science and technology that will pave the way for the next generation of artificially intelligent systems. \nFor information about employment opportunities with IBM at the new AI Lab, please visit MITIBMWatsonAILab.mit.edu. \nTopics: Artificial intelligence , Machine learning , Algorithms , Computer science and technology , Research , Collaboration , School of Engineering , Cambridge, Boston and region , Industry , Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) , Media Lab , IDSS , Brain and cognitive sciences , President L.

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nAmazon announced Thursday that it is hunting for a site for a new headquarters in North America, in addition to its sprawling Seattle hub. \nAmazon says that it will spend more than $5 billion US to build another headquarters in North America to house as many as 50,000 employees. The technology company plans to stay in its current Seattle headquarters and the new space will be a full equal of its current home, said Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. \nToronto Mayor John Tory has already jumped on board, leading the charge to convince Amazon that it should call the city its second home. \nCould Edmonton be next? \nREAD MORE: World-leading artificial intelligence program at University of Alberta gets major boost \nEdmonton Economic Development said it’s aware of Amazon’s request for proposals (RFP) and will take a closer look. \n“Canadian cities will certainly be scrambling, all of the big ones, to understand this opportunity,” Mayor Don Iveson said. \n“In our case, we’ll rally everyone from the airport authority to the local and regional economic development entities to the downtown business association to make a case for why Amazon should come and take one of the half empty or empty buildings in our downtown that are on sale right now, right in the heart of the innovation corridor that runs from NAIT to the U of A and has some of the brightest machine-learning people.” \nREAD MORE: Prominent artificial intelligence firm to open 1st lab outside UK in Edmonton \n“Amazon’s all about machine learning and customization and automation and anticipation. So, if they want to be close to Google DeepMind, and Machine Intelligence Institute which is one of the best in the world then maybe Edmonton would be a good place for them to choose. \n“We’re looking at it and I’ve been in touch with Edmonton Economic Development already and things are moving,” the mayor said. \nEdmonton could see some tough competition from out east. \nIn a statement, Toronto’s mayor said that city is a prime candidate for the technology giant and city staff plan to put together an attractive bid. \n“I think it would be a regional full-court press because landing an anchor tenant like that, a global technology company, for any major Canadian city would be a coup,” Iveson said. \nWATCH: Startup Edmonton assisting local entrepreneurs \n“Certainly for Edmonton, they’d be able to take advantage of competitive leasing opportunities in our downtown as well as a great quality of life in the fastest-growing, youngest city with some of the best talent in the world in these technology areas. \n“It’s a really exciting prospect. It’s going to be fiercely, fiercely, contested I’m sure, so we certainly want to explore the opportunity and put in something attractive.” \nThe company wants a city of more than a million people with an international airport, good education and mass transit. \nCities have a little more than a month to apply through a special website, and the company said it will make a final decision next year. \n— With files from The Canadian Press and Scott Johnston, 630 CHED © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

      "text": "Racist & sexist AI bots could deny you job, insurance & loans – tech experts Published time: 25 Aug, 2017 21:44 Get short URL © Fabian Bimmer / Reuters Artificial intelligence programs designed to assess candidates for university places and bank loans may be inherently racist and sexist, according to technology experts. \nResearchers believe that machine-learning algorithms, far from making the world more equitable, are now mimicking society’s inequality by discriminating against women and ethnic minorities. \n“This is beginning to come up a lot in areas like shortlisting people for jobs, insurance, loans – all those things,” Noel Sharkey, Co-Director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, told the BBC’s Today program. \nSharkey cited the example of research from Boston University in which an AI was trained to read Google News. When asked during a word association game, “man is to computer programmer what woman is to x”, the computer replied “homemaker.” \n“We have a problem,” said Sharkey. “We need more women coming into this field to solve it.” \nIn the US, 20 percent of engineering school graduates are women but make up just 11 percent of practicing engineers . In the UK, nine percent of the engineering workforce is female. 'Minority Report’ comes to reality: #China plans to use #AI to collar suspects before they do the crime https://t.co/R6cVy2oXAL pic.twitter.com/IkDEPBZhBh — RT (@RT_com) July 27, 2017 \nHealth data expert Maxine Mackintosh said “imperfect” datasets based on historical information skew AI replies. This, she said, was seen in London’s St George’s Hospital where pre-tests of medical school applications revealed that the hospital’s AI was discriminating against women as well as black and ethnic minorities despite new research showing that women are better doctors than men. \n“These big data are really a social mirror – they reflect the biases and inequalities we have in society,” she told the BBC. “If you want to take steps towards changing that you can’t just use historical information.” \nThe issue of AI’s struggles with racial diversity has been in the spotlight in recent times. \nLast year, Microsoft was forced to take its machine-learning Twitter chatbot ‘Tay’ offline after it took just 24 hours to become a Nazi sympathizer. \"Tay\" went from \"humans are super cool\" to full nazi in <24 hrs and I'm not at all concerned about the future of AI pic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A — gerry (@geraldmellor) March 24, 2016 \nEarlier this week, video surfaced online of a black man failing to get soap from an automatic dispenser in Lagos, Nigeria. If you have ever had a problem grasping the importance of diversity in tech and its impact on society, watch this video pic.twitter.com/ZJ1Je1C4NW — Chukwuemeka Afigbo (@nke_ise) August 16, 2017 \nIn the footage, Lagos resident Chukwuemeka Afigbo films a white man getting soap from the dispenser. When a dark-skinned man tries to do the same, the machine fails to respond. Eventually a white paper towel is passed under the device, immediately triggering the sanitizer. ",

      "text": "Apple Wins Top Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition Award for First AI Research Paper   6:23 PM PDT by Juli Clover Back in October, Apple published its first research paper related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The paper, titled \"Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training,\" focused on advanced image recognition techniques and the use of both simulated and real images to train an advanced AI image program. Apple's research paper was accepted to the 2017 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) back in July, and as it turns out, Apple's work won a \"CVPR 2017 Best Paper Award,\" coveted in the machine learning field. MacRumors reader Tom, who holds a PhD in the field, says that CVPR is the most influential AI/machine learning conference, and that winning the award is a rare achievement \"even for the top people in the field.\" The paper was written by Apple researchers Ashish Shrivastava, Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Joshua Susskind, Wenda Wang, and Russell Webb. In addition to publishing research papers, Apple's AI and machine learning teams now maintain a Machine Learning Journal, detailing the work of Apple's engineers. The blog was just updated this week with articles that were shared at Interspeech 2017 in Stockholm, Sweden. Thanks, Tom!",

Share Leave a comment \nIBM and MIT today announced that IBM plans to make a 10-year, $240 million investment to create the MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab in partnership with MIT. The lab will carry out fundamental artificial intelligence (AI) research and seek to propel scientific breakthroughs that unlock the potential of AI. The collaboration aims to advance AI hardware, software, and algorithms related to deep learning and other areas; increase AI’s impact on industries, such as health care and cybersecurity; and explore the economic and ethical implications of AI on society. IBM’s $240 million investment in the lab will support research by IBM and MIT scientists. \nThe new lab will be one of the largest long-term university-industry AI collaborations to date, mobilizing the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors, and students to pursue joint research at IBM's Research Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts — co-located with the IBM Watson Health and IBM Security headquarters in Kendall Square — and on the neighboring MIT campus. \nThe lab will be co-chaired by Dario Gil, IBM Research VP of AI and IBM Q, and Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering. (Read a related Q&A with Chandrakasan.) IBM and MIT plan to issue a call for proposals to MIT researchers and IBM scientists to submit their ideas for joint research to push the boundaries in AI science and technology in several areas, including: AI algorithms: Developing advanced algorithms to expand capabilities in machine learning and reasoning. Researchers will create AI systems that move beyond specialized tasks to tackle more complex problems and benefit from robust, continuous learning. Researchers will invent new algorithms that can not only leverage big data when available, but also learn from limited data to augment human intelligence. Physics of AI: Investigating new AI hardware materials, devices, and architectures that will support future analog computational approaches to AI model training and deployment, as well as the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. The latter involves using AI to help characterize and improve quantum devices, and researching the use of quantum computing to optimize and speed up machine-learning algorithms and other AI applications. Application of AI to industries: Given its location in IBM Watson Health and IBM Security headquarters in Kendall Square, a global hub of biomedical innovation, the lab will develop new applications of AI for professional use, including fields such as health care and cybersecurity. The collaboration will explore the use of AI in areas such as the security and privacy of medical data, personalization of health care, image analysis, and the optimum treatment paths for specific patients. Advancing shared prosperity through AI : The MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab will explore how AI can deliver economic and societal benefits to a broader range of people, nations, and enterprises. The lab will study the economic implications of AI and investigate how AI can improve prosperity and help individuals achieve more in their lives. \nIn addition to IBM’s plan to produce innovations that advance the frontiers of AI, a distinct objective of the new lab is to encourage MIT faculty and students to launch companies that will focus on commercializing AI inventions and technologies that are developed at the lab. The lab’s scientists also will publish their work, contribute to the release of open source material, and foster an adherence to the ethical application of AI. \n“The field of artificial intelligence has experienced incredible growth and progress over the past decade. Yet today’s AI systems, as remarkable as they are, will require new innovations to tackle increasingly difficult real-world problems to improve our work and lives,” says John Kelly III, IBM senior vice president, Cognitive Solutions and Research. “The extremely broad and deep technical capabilities and talent at MIT and IBM are unmatched, and will lead the field of AI for at least the next decade.” \n“I am delighted by this new collaboration,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif says. “True breakthroughs are often the result of fresh thinking inspired by new kinds of research teams. The combined MIT and IBM talent dedicated to this new effort will bring formidable power to a field with staggering potential to advance knowledge and help solve important challenges.” \nBoth MIT and IBM have been pioneers in artificial intelligence research, and the new AI lab builds on a decades-long research relationship between the two. In 2016, IBM Research announced a multiyear collaboration with MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences to advance the scientific field of machine vision, a core aspect of artificial intelligence. The collaboration has brought together leading brain, cognitive, and computer scientists to conduct research in the field of unsupervised machine understanding of audio-visual streams of data, using insights from next-generation models of the brain to inform advances in machine vision. In addition, IBM and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have established a five-year, $50 million research collaboration on AI and genomics. \nMIT researchers were among those who helped coin and popularize the very phrase “artificial intelligence” in the 1950s. MIT pushed several major advances in the subsequent decades, from neural networks to data encryption to quantum computing to crowdsourcing. Marvin Minsky, a founder of the discipline, collaborated on building the first artificial neural network and he, along with Seymour Papert, advanced learning algorithms. Currently, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the Media Lab, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society serve as connected hubs for AI and related research at MIT. \nFor more than 20 years, IBM has explored the application of AI across many areas and industries. IBM researchers invented and built Watson, which is a cloud-based AI platform being used by businesses, developers, and universities to fight cancer, improve classroom learning, minimize pollution, enhance agriculture and oil and gas exploration, better manage financial investments, and much more. Today, IBM scientists across the globe are working on fundamental advances in AI algorithms, science and technology that will pave the way for the next generation of artificially intelligent systems. \nFor information about employment opportunities with IBM at the new AI Lab, please visit MITIBMWatsonAILab.mit.edu. \nTopics: Artificial intelligence , Machine learning , Algorithms , Computer science and technology , Research , Collaboration , School of Engineering , Cambridge, Boston and region , Industry , Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) , Media Lab , IDSS , Brain and cognitive sciences , President L.

      "text": "Google Doubles Down on Purging Conservative Speech The Associated Press by Chriss W. Street 22 Aug 2017 Newport Beach, CA 0\n22 Aug, 2017 22 Aug, 2017 Google announced that their monopolistic search engine that controls 87 percent of page views will use its machine learning tool set to assist liberal groups in doubling down on purging conservative speech they consider hate. TechCrunch blog reported that Google has partnered with ProPublica coalition and Pitch Interactive to create a data visualization tools that leverage the Google Cloud Natural Language API analytic algorithm to extract geographic and contextual information to provide journalists with a 50-state ‘ Hate News Index .’\nadvertisement The ‘ Media Bias/Fact Check’ blog that analyzes the point-of-view of over 1,700+ news sources, rates ProPublica as “Left-Center Bias.” The top link on its landing page, ‘THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: Ongoing coverage of the 45th president and his new administration ,’ reflects that point-of-view by prominently listing ‘ Documenting Hate ’ directly underneath.\nThe Google/ProPublica coalition partners are all Center-Left Bias or Left Bias including the New York Times, BuzzFeed, Univision News, WNYC, First Draft, The Root, Meedan, New America Media, Latino USA, Ushahidi, The Advocate and 100 Days in Appalachia.\nAlthough the coalition states they will work on civil rights issues with the highly respected University of Miami School of Communications, they also will rely on input from George Soros’ Open Society Foundation-funded and the radically Left Southern Poverty Law Center .\nGoogle states that they launched the Documenting Hate project due to the lack of national data on “hate crimes,” which their Dictionary defines as: “a crime motivated by racial, sexual, or other prejudice, typically one involving violence.” But a Google search under “hate crime” produces “About 10,300,000 results.”\nConservatives sites have complained for years that Facebook and Twitter trending news curators were biased against their publications. After former “trending news” editors told Gizmodo in October, just weeks before the presidential election, that ninety of the Facebook news curation staff are liberal and “ We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News ,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg was forced to fire the entire group and use an app to curate news.\nGoogle’s reputation for being relatively impartial seems to have changed after the January 2017 swearing in of Donald Trump as the 45 th President of the United States. Quartz reported less than a month later, Google and its Alphabet sister company Jigsaw would start using a set of machine learning to police the Internet against hate speech.\nJigsaw’s landing page advertises its “technology make people in the world safer.” Its suite of machine learning anti-hacker tools includes Perspective , Project Shield , uProxy , Password Alert , Conversation AI , Digital Attack Map , and Unfiltered News . But a deeper investigation of the Jigsaw site illuminates what the company calls “Graduated” tools used to censor and demonetize Google search results that include Share the Facts , Redirect Method , Montage , Copcast , Sideways Dictionary and Investigative Dashboard .\nEach of the “Graduated” tools were supposedly designed to interrupt dangerous Internet activity, such as ISIS recruiting of terrorists. But the scandal surrounding James Damore’s outing of ‘Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber’ has elevated concerns that the company is using the Redirect Method to “combat” the online vitriol of conservative speech.\nAccording to Jigsaw: “The Redirect Method is focused on reaching those who are actively looking for extremist content and connections. Rather than create new content and counter-narratives, our approach tries to divert young people off the path to extremism using pre-existing YouTube content and targeted advertising.”\nConservative should be concerned that Google’s use of “tools” to selectively shame hate speech sound allot like the “counter propaganda” tools described in the U.S. Army PSYOP Field Manual to “exploit the psychological soft spots created by an individual’s needs, goals, fears, and worries.”\n Big Government , Breitbart California , Tech , 45th President of the United States , 50-state , algorithm , anti-hacker tool , Buzzfeed , censor , Center-Left Bias , civil rights , conservative speech , Conversation AI , Copcast , demonetize , Digital Attack Map , Documenting Hate , facebook , First Draft , George Soros , Google , Google Cloud Natural Language API , Google coalition , Google Graduated tools , Google search result , Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber , Hate News Index , Investigative Dashboard , ISIS , James Damore , Jigsaw , Latino USA , Left Bias , Meedan , momopoly , Montage , New America Media , New York Times , Open Society Foundation radical Left , outing , Password Alert , perspective , President Trump , Project Shield , ProPublica , psychological soft spots , PSYOP , Redirect Method , Share the Facts , Sideways Dictionary , Southern Poverty Law Center , The Advocate and 100 Days in Appalachia , The Root , Twitter , U.S. Army Field Manuel , U.S. Army PSYOP Field Manual , Unfiltered News , University of Miami School of Communications , Univision News , uProxy , Ushahidi , We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News , WNYC",

      "text": "Make predictions Monitor predictions \nNext, we go into detail about how Michelangelo’s architecture facilitates each stage of this workflow. Manage data \nFinding good features is often the hardest part of machine learning and we have found that building and managing data pipelines is typically one of the most costly pieces of a complete machine learning solution. \nA platform should provide standard tools for building data pipelines to generate feature and label data sets for training (and re-training) and feature-only data sets for predicting. These tools should have deep integration with the company’s data lake or warehouses and with the company’s online data serving systems. The pipelines need to be scalable and performant, incorporate integrated monitoring for data flow and data quality, and support both online and offline training and predicting. Ideally, they should also generate the features in a way that is shareable across teams to reduce duplicate work and increase data quality. They should also provide strong guard rails and controls to encourage and empower users to adopt best practices (e.g., making it easy to guarantee that the same data generation/preparation process is used at both training time and prediction time). \nThe data management components of Michelangelo are divided between online and offline pipelines. Currently, the offline pipelines are used to feed batch model training and batch prediction jobs and the online pipelines feed online, low latency predictions (and in the near future, online learning systems). \nIn addition, we added a layer of data management, a feature store that allows teams to share, discover, and use a highly curated set of features for their machine learning problems. We found that many modeling problems at Uber use identical or similar features, and there is substantial value in enabling teams to share features between their own projects and for teams in different organizations to share features with each other. Figure 2: Data preparation pipelines push data into the Feature Store tables and training data repositories. Offline \nUber’s transactional and log data flows into an HDFS data lake and is easily accessible via Spark and Hive SQL compute jobs. We provide containers and scheduling to run regular jobs to compute features which can be made private to a project or published to the Feature Store (see below) and shared across teams, while batch jobs run on a schedule or a trigger and are integrated with data quality monitoring tools to quickly detect regressions in the pipeline – either due to local or upstream code or data issues. Online \nModels that are deployed online cannot access data stored in HDFS, and it is often difficult to compute some features in a performant manner directly from the online databases that back Uber’s production services (for instance, it is not possible to directly query the UberEATS order service to compute the average meal prep time for a restaurant over a specific period of time). Instead, we allow features needed for online models to be precomputed and stored in Cassandra where they can be read at low latency at prediction time. \nWe support two options for computing these online-served features, batch precompute and near-real-time compute, outlined below: Batch precompute. The first option for computing is to conduct bulk precomputing and loading historical features from HDFS into Cassandra on a regular basis. This is simple and efficient, and generally works well for historical features where it is acceptable for the features to only be updated every few hours or once a day. This system guarantees that the same data and batch pipeline is used for both training and serving. UberEATS uses this system for features like a ‘ restaurant’s average meal preparation time over the last seven days .’ Near-real-time comput e . The second option is to publish relevant metrics to Kafka and then run Samza-based streaming compute jobs to generate aggregate features at low latency. These features are then written directly to Cassandra for serving and logged back to HDFS for future training jobs. Like the batch system, near-real-time compute ensures that the same data is used for training and serving. To avoid a cold start, we provide a tool to “backfill” this data and generate training data by running a batch job against historical logs. UberEATS uses this near-realtime pipeline for features like a ‘restaurant’s average meal preparation time over the last one hour.’ Shared feature store \nWe found great value in building a centralized Feature Store in which teams around Uber can create and manage canonical features to be used by their teams and shared with others. At a high level, it accomplishes two things: It allows users to easily add features they have built into a shared feature store, requiring only a small amount of extra metadata (owner, description, SLA, etc.) on top of what would be required for a feature generated for private, project-specific usage. Once features are in the Feature Store, they are very easy to consume, both online and offline, by referencing a feature’s simple canonical name in the model configuration. Equipped with this information, the system handles joining in the correct HDFS data sets for model training or batch prediction and fetching the right value from Cassandra for online predictions. \nAt the moment, we have approximately 10,000 features in Feature Store that are used to accelerate machine learning projects, and teams across the company are adding new ones all the time. Features in the Feature Store are automatically calculated and updated daily. \nIn the future, we intend to explore the possibility of building an automated system to search through Feature Store and identify the most useful and important features for solving a given prediction problem. Domain specific language for feature selection and transformation \nOften the features generated by data pipelines or sent from a client service are not in the proper format for the model, and they may be missing values that need to be filled. Moreover, the model may only need a subset of features provided. In some cases, it may be more useful for the model to transform a timestamp into an hour-of-day or day-of-week to better capture seasonal patterns. In other cases, feature values may need to be normalized (e.g., subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation). \nTo address these issues, we created a DSL (domain specific language) that modelers use to select, transform, and combine the features that are sent to the model at training and prediction times. The DSL is implemented as sub-set of Scala. It is a pure functional language with a complete set of commonly used functions. With this DSL, we also provide the ability for customer teams to add their own user-defined functions. There are accessor functions that fetch feature values from the current context (data pipeline in the case of an offline model or current request from client in the case of an online model) or from the Feature Store. \nIt is important to note that the DSL expressions are part of the model configuration and the same expressions are applied at training time and at prediction time to help guarantee that the same final set of features is generated and sent to the model in both cases. Train models \nWe currently support offline, large-scale distributed training of decision trees, linear and logistic models, unsupervised models ( k-means ), time series models, and deep neural networks. We regularly add new algorithms in response to customer need and as they are developed by Uber’s AI Labs and other internal researchers. In addition, we let customer teams add their own model types by providing custom training, evaluation, and serving code. The distributed model training system scales up to handle billions of samples and down to small datasets for quick iterations. \nA model configuration specifies the model type, hyper-parameters, data source reference, and feature DSL expressions, as well as compute resource requirements (the number of machines, how much memory, whether or not to use GPUs, etc.). It is used to configure the training job, which is run on a YARN or Mesos cluster. \nAfter the model is trained, performance metrics (e.g., ROC curve and PR curve) are computed and combined into a model evaluation report. At the end of training, the original configuration, the learned parameters, and the evaluation report are saved back to our model repository for analysis and deployment. \nIn addition to training single models, Michelangelo supports hyper-parameter search for all model types as well as partitioned models. With partitioned models, we automatically partition the training data based on configuration from the user and then train one model per partition, falling back to a parent model when needed (e.g. training one model per city and falling back to a country-level model when an accurate city-level model cannot be achieved). \nTraining jobs can be configured and managed through a web UI or an API, often via Jupyter notebook . Many teams use the API and workflow tools to schedule regular re-training of their models. Figure 3: Model training jobs use Feature Store and training data repository data sets to train models and then push them to the model repository. Evaluate models \nModels are often trained as part of a methodical exploration process to identify the set of features, algorithms, and hyper-parameters that create the best model for their problem. Before arriving at the ideal model for a given use case, it is not uncommon to train hundreds of models that do not make the cut. Though not ultimately used in production, the performance of these models guide engineers towards the model configuration that results in the best model performance. Keeping track of these trained models (e.g. who trained them and when, on what data set, with which hyper-parameters, etc.), evaluating them, and comparing them to each other are typically big challenges when dealing with so many models and present opportunities for the platform to add a lot of value. \nFor every model that is trained in Michelangelo, we store a versioned object in our model repository in Cassandra that contains a record of: Who trained the model Start and end time of the training job Full model configuration (features used, hyper-parameter values, etc.) Reference to training and test data sets Distribution and relative importance of each feature Model accuracy metrics Standard charts and graphs for each model type (e.g. ROC curve, PR curve, and confusion matrix for a binary classifier) Full learned parameters of the model Summary statistics for model visualization \nThe information is easily available to the user through a web UI and programmatically through an API, both for inspecting the details of an individual model and for comparing one or more models with each other. Model accuracy report \nThe model accuracy report for a regression model shows standard accuracy metrics and charts. Classification models would display a different set, as depicted below in Figures 4 and 5: Figure 4: Regression model reports show regression-related performance metrics. \nFigure 5: Binary classification performance reports show classification-related performance metrics. Decision tree visualization \nFor important model types, we provide sophisticated visualization tools to help modelers understand why a model behaves as it does, as well as to help debug it if necessary. In the case of decision tree models, we let the user browse through each of the individual trees to see their relative importance to the overall model, their split points, the importance of each feature to a particular tree, and the distribution of data at each split, among other variables. The user can specify feature values and the visualization will depict the triggered paths down the decision trees, the prediction per tree, and the overall prediction for the model, as pictured in Figure 6 below: Figure 6: Tree models can be explored with powerful tree visualizations. Feature report \nMichelangelo provides a feature report that shows each feature in order of importance to the model along with partial dependence plots and distribution histograms. Selecting two features lets the user understand the feature interactions as a two-way partial dependence diagram, as showcased below: Figure 7: Features, their impact on the model, and their interactions can be explored though a feature report. Deploy models \nMichelangelo has end-to-end support for managing model deployment via the UI or API and three modes in which a model can be deployed: Offline deployment. The model is deployed to an offline container and run in a Spark job to generate batch predictions either on demand or on a repeating schedule. Online deployment. The model is deployed to an online prediction service cluster (generally containing hundreds of machines behind a load balancer) where clients can send individual or batched prediction requests as network RPC calls. Library deployment. We intend to launch a model that is deployed to a serving container that is embedded as a library in another service and invoked via a Java API. (It is not shown in Figure 8, below, but works similarly to online deployment). Figure 8: Models from the model repository are deployed to online and offline containers for serving. \nIn all cases, the required model artifacts (metadata files, model parameter files, and compiled DSL expressions) are packaged in a ZIP archive and copied to the relevant hosts across Uber’s data centers using our standard code deployment infrastructure. The prediction containers automatically load the new models from disk and start handling prediction requests. \nMany teams have automation scripts to schedule regular model retraining and deployment via Michelangelo’s API. In the case of the UberEATS delivery time models, training and deployment are triggered manually by data scientists and engineers through the web UI. Make predictions \nOnce models are deployed and loaded by the serving container, they are used to make predictions based on feature data loaded from a data pipeline or directly from a client service. The raw features are passed through the compiled DSL expressions which can modify the raw features and/or fetch additional features from the Feature Store. The final feature vector is constructed and passed to the model for scoring. In the case of online models, the prediction is returned to the client service over the network. In the case of offline models, the predictions are written back to Hive where they can be consumed by downstream batch jobs or accessed by users directly through SQL-based query tools, as depicted below: Figure 9: Online and offline prediction services use sets of feature vectors to generate predictions. Referencing models \nMore than one model can be deployed at the same time to a given serving container. This allows safe transitions from old models to new models and side-by-side A/B testing of models. At serving time, a model is identified by its UUID and an optional tag (or alias) that is specified during deployment. In the case of an online model, the client service sends the feature vector along with the model UUID or model tag that it wants to use; in the case of a tag, the container will generate the prediction using the model most recently deployed to that tag. In the case of batch models, all deployed models are used to score each batch data set and the prediction records contain the model UUID and optional tag so that consumers can filter as appropriate. \nIf both models have the same signature (i.e. expect the same set of features) when deploying a new model to replace an old model, users can deploy the new model to the same tag as the old model and the container will start using the new model immediately. This allows customers to update their models without requiring a change in their client code. Users can also deploy the new model using just its UUID and then modify a configuration in the client or intermediate service to gradually switch traffic from the old model UUID to the new one. \nFor A/B testing of models, users can simply deploy competing models either via UUIDs or tags and then use Uber’s experimentation framework from within the client service to send portions of the traffic to each model and track performance metrics. Scale and latency \nSince machine learning models are stateless and share nothing, they are trivial to scale out, both in online and offline serving modes. In the case of online models, we can simply add more hosts to the prediction service cluster and let the load balancer spread the load. In the case of offline predictions, we can add more Spark executors and let Spark manage the parallelism. \nOnline serving latency depends on model type and complexity and whether or not the model requires features from the Cassandra feature store. In the case of a model that does not need features from Cassandra, we typically see P95 latency of less than 5 milliseconds (ms). In the case of models that do require features from Cassandra, we typically see P95 latency of less than 10ms. The highest traffic models right now are serving more than 250,000 predictions per second. Monitor predictions \nWhen a model is trained and evaluated, historical data is always used. To make sure that a model is working well into the future, it is critical to monitor its predictions so as to ensure that the data pipelines are continuing to send accurate data and that production environment has not changed such that the model is no longer accurate. \nTo address this, Michelangelo can automatically log and optionally hold back a percentage of the predictions that it makes and then later join those predictions to the observed outcomes (or labels) generated by the data pipeline. With this information, we can generate ongoing, live measurements of model accuracy. In the case of a regression model, we publish R-squared/ coefficient of determination , root mean square logarithmic error (RMSLE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error metrics to Uber’s time series monitoring systems so that users can analyze charts over time and set threshold alerts, as depicted below: Figure 10: Predictions are sampled and compared to observed outcomes to generate model accuracy metrics. Management plane, API, and web UI \nThe last important piece of the system is an API tier. This is the brains of the system. It consists of a management application that serves the web UI and network API and integrations with Uber’s system monitoring and alerting infrastructure. This tier also houses the workflow system that is used to orchestrate the batch data pipelines, training jobs, batch prediction jobs, and the deployment of models both to batch and online containers. \nUsers of Michelangelo interact directly with these components through the web UI, the REST API, and the monitoring and alerting tools. \nBuilding on the Michelangelo platform \nIn the coming months, we plan to continue scaling and hardening the existing system to support both the growth of our set of customer teams and Uber’s business overall. As the platform layers mature, we plan to invest in higher level tools and services to drive democratization of machine learning and better support the needs of our business: AutoML. This will be a system for automatically searching and discovering model configurations (algorithm, feature sets, hyper-parameter values, etc.) that result in the best performing models for given modeling problems. The system would also automatically build the production data pipelines to generate the features and labels needed to power the models. We have addressed big pieces of this already with our Feature Store, our unified offline and online data pipelines, and hyper-parameter search feature. We plan to accelerate our earlier data science work through AutoML. The system would allow data scientists to specify a set of labels and an objective function, and then would make the most privacy-and security-aware use of Uber’s data to find the best model for the problem. The goal is to amplify data scientist productivity with smart tools that make their job easier. Model visualization. Understanding and debugging models is increasingly important, especially for deep learning. While we have made some important first steps with visualization tools for tree-based models, much more needs to be done to enable data scientists to understand, debug, and tune their models and for users to trust the results. Online learning . Most of Uber’s machine learning models directly affect the Uber product in real time. This means they operate in the complex and ever-changing environment of moving things in the physical world. To keep our models accurate as this environment changes, our models need to change with it. Today, teams are regularly retraining their models in Michelangelo. A full platform solution to this use case involves easily updateable model types, faster training and evaluation architecture and pipelines, automated model validation and deployment, and sophisticated monitoring and alerting systems. Though a big project, early results suggest substantial potential gains from doing online learning right. Distributed deep learning. An increasing number of Uber’s machine learning systems are implementing deep learning technologies. The user workflow of defining and iterating on deep learning models is sufficiently different from the standard workflow such that it needs unique platform support. Deep learning use cases typically handle a larger quantity of data, and different hardware requirements (i.e. GPUs) motivate further investments into distributed learning and a tighter integration with a flexible resource management stack. \nIf you are interesting in tackling machine learning challenges that push the limits of scale, consider applying for a role on our team! \nJeremy Hermann is an Engineering Manager and Mike Del Balso is a Product Manager on Uber’s Machine Learning Platform team. \n",

      "text": "Google acquires AIMatter, maker of the Fabby computer vision app Posted Nvidia invests in Chinese autonomous trucking startup TuSimple Computer vision — the branch of artificial intelligence that lets computers “see” and process images like humans do (and, actually, often better than us), and then use those images to help run programs — is at the heart of how the next generation of tech is developing, and this week Google made an acquisition this week to help it along with its own efforts in this area. \nThe search and Android giant has acquired AIMatter , a startup founded in Belarus that has built both a neural network -based AI platform and SDK to detect and process images quickly on mobile devices, and a photo and video editing app that has served as a proof-of-concept of the tech called Fabby . \nWe’d had wind of the deal going down as far back as May, although it only officially closed today. Fabby and Google have confirmed the deal to us and there should be a statement posted on AIMatter’s site about the news soon (update: it’s up). A Google spokesperson provided TC with a short statement: “We are excited to welcome the AIMatter team to Google.” \nTerms of the sale are not being disclosed, but we understand that Fabby — which has had over 2 million downloads — will continue to run, and from what we understand most of AIMatter’s employees will come over to Google. AIMatter had people working in Minsk, the Bay Area, and Zurich (Switzerland being particularly strong in computer vision tech, see here , here , and here ). It’s not clear yet if the staff will stay where they are now or relocate elsewhere, or what else they will be working on for Google.) \nFabby had raised around $2 million in funding with backers including Haxus, a venture fund that backs artificial intelligence startups; Yuri Melnichek, who started as the co-founder and chairman of AIMatter but now described as an investor and advisor (he’d also founded Maps.me and is himself an ex-Googler); and Andrei Kulik, who is AIMatter’s CEO. \nNotably, Haxus also invested in MSQRD , which was acquired by Facebook; Maps.me , which was acquired by Mail.ru; and Prisma , the popular app that can turn any photo or video into a “painting” using filters in the style of different artists or artistic movements. \nPrisma, I should note, is still independent (for now: we’d variously heard rumors that both Facebook and Snapchat had been interested in past months). But the rapid acquisition pace we’ve seen in this area is a testament to how in-demand computer vision technology is today. This isn’t just for fun apps that let you add dog ears and crazy hair colors to your photos — although, as Fabby, Prisma, Snapchat, Facebook and countless others have proven, filters can be a lot of fun. It’s also an essential component of new computing platforms for virtual and augmented reality applications, for autonomous driving and more. \nAs we said, it’s not clear where Google hopes to use this tech. The company has long been eyeing up how it can get more involved in the next generation of social applications, not just to build bigger audiences on these platforms but also to use them to build new frontiers in its advertising business. \nWhen you consider how Snapchat has used photo filtering tech to great effect in its commercial strategy, that could be one area where Google is hoping to do more, too. But there are also Google’s efforts in VR and AR; and its work in building machine learning platforms like TensorFlow for developers to build their own apps using machine learning (AIMatter’s SDK could be notable here). In short, there are a lot of possibilities — not unlike the number of filters that Fabby has on offer. \n",

      "text": "See below for an important update.\nGoogle revealed in a blog post that it is now using machine learning to document \"hate crimes and events\" in America. They've partnered with liberal groups like ProPublica, BuzzFeed News, and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to make information about \"hate events\" easily accessible to journalists. And now, there are troubling signs that this tool could be used to ferret out writers and websites that run afoul of the progressive orthodoxy.\nIn the announcement, Simon Rogers, data editor of Google News Labs, wrote :\nNow, with ProPublica, we are launching a new machine learning tool to help journalists covering hate news leverage this data in their reporting.\nThe Documenting Hate News Index — built by the Google News Lab , data visualization studio Pitch Interactive and ProPublica — takes a raw feed of Google News articles from the past six months and uses the Google Cloud Natural Language API to create a visual tool to help reporters find news happening across the country. It’s a constantly-updating snapshot of data from this year, one which is valuable as a starting point to reporting on this area of news.\nThe Documenting Hate project launched in response to the lack of national data on hate crimes. While the FBI is required by law to collect data about hate crimes, the data is incomplete because local jurisdictions aren't required to report incidents up to the federal government.\nAll of which underlines the value of the Documenting Hate Project, which is powered by a number of different news organisations and journalists who collect and verify reports of hate crimes and events. Documenting Hate is informed by both reports from members of the public and raw Google News data of stories from across the nation.\nOn the surface, this looks rather innocuous. It's presented by Google as an attempt to create a database of hate crimes — information that should be available with a quick Google search, it should be noted. But a quick glance at the list of partners for this project should raise some red flags:\nThe ProPublica -led coalition includes The Google News Lab , Univision News , the New York Times , WNYC , BuzzFeed News , First Draft , Meedan , New America Media , The Root , Latino USA , The Advocate , 100 Days in Appalachia and Ushahidi . The coalition is also working with civil-rights groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center , and schools such as the University of Miami School of Communications .\nProPublica poses as a middle-of-the-road non-profit journalistic operation, but in reality, it's funded by a stable of uber-liberal donors, including George Soros's Open Society Foundations and Herb and Marion Sandler, billionaire former mortgage bankers whose Golden West Financial Corp. allegedly targeted subprime borrowers with \"pick-a-pay\" mortgages that led to toxic assets that were blamed for the collapse of Wachovia. The Southern Poverty Law Center, of course, is infamous for targeting legitimate conservatives groups , branding them as \"hate groups\" because they refuse to walk in lockstep with the progressive agenda. And it goes with out saying that The New York Times and BuzzFeed News lean left.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/08/19/propublica-working-google-document-hate-threatens-conservative-bloggers/\nload more",

      "text": "share Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Around 300 apps have been withdrawn from Google’s Play Store after they were found to be secretly hijacking Android devices to supply traffic for wide-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, as noted by Gizmodo . Google removed apps that offered services like ringtones and storage managers after security researchers uncovered the “WireX” botnet was behind the ploy. Malware was hidden inside the affected apps, and as long as the device remained switched on it was used in DDoS attacks. Researchers at cloud services provider Akamai discovered WireX after a hospitality company suffered from a DDoS attack involving hundreds of thousands of IP addresses. DDoS attacks work by overwhelming a target with large amounts of data from multiple IP addresses, and they’re effective at taking down websites and services that can’t cope with a data influx. Google said in a statement it’s currently in the process of removing the malicious apps from affected devices, and some researchers say up to 70,000 devices in 100 countries could be compromised . Some of the WireX attacks also asked for ransom fees. “Something malicious, possibly running on top of the Android operating system.” Researchers from Akami, Cloudflare, Flashpoint, Google, Team Cymru, and others are working together to combat the botnet, which came to their attention on August 17. “Once the larger collaborative effort began, the investigation began to unfold rapidly starting with the investigation of historic log information, which revealed a connection between the attacking IPs and something malicious, possibly running on top of the Android operating system,” the researchers wrote in a joint blog post . The researchers say organizations should share detailed metrics about DDoS attacks, in an effort to combat and learn more about them. Google is using machine learning to fight problem apps, and in May published a report showing some of its aggressive moves against malicious apps like better patching schedules is starting to pay off .

Gartner believes that key platform-enabling technologies are 5G, Digital Twin, Edge Computing, Blockchain, IoT Platforms, Neuromorphic Hardware, Quantum Computing, Serverless PaaS and Software-Defined Security. Source: Gartner Identifies Three Megatrends That Will Drive Digital Business Into the Next Decade August 15, 2017 \nKey takeaways from this year’s Hype Cycle include the following: Heavy R&D spending from Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Facebook is fueling a race for Deep Learning and Machine Learning patents today and will accelerate in the future – The race is on for Intellectual Property (IP) in deep learning and machine learning today. The success of Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google's Google Now, Microsoft's Cortana and others are making this area the top priority for R&D investment by these companies today. Gartner predicts deep-learning applications and tools will be a standard component in 80% of data scientists' tool boxes by 2018. Amazon Machine Learning is available on Amazon Web Services today, accessible here . Apple has also launched a Machine Learning Journal . Baidu Research provides a site full of useful information on their ongoing research and development as well. Google Research is one of the most comprehensive of all, with a wealth of publications and research results. IBM’s AI and Cognitive Computing site can be found here . The Facebook Research site provides a wealth of information on 11 core technologies their R&D team is working on right now. Many of these sites also list open positions on their R&D teams. 5G adoption in the coming decade will bring significant gains for security, scalability, and speed of global cellular networks – Gartner predicts that by 2020, 3% of network-based mobile communications service providers (CSPs) will launch 5G networks commercially. The Hype Cycle report mentions that from 2018 through 2022 organizations will most often utilize 5G to support IoT communications, high definition video and fixed wireless access. AT&T, NTT Docomo, Sprint USA, Telstra, T-Mobile, and Verizon have all announced plans to launch 5G services this year and next. Artificial General Intelligence is going to become pervasive during the next decade, becoming the foundation of AI as a Service – Gartner predicts that AI as a Service will be the enabling core technology that leads to the convergence of AI Everywhere, Transparently Immersive Experiences and Digital Platforms. The research firm is also predicting 4D Printing, Autonomous Vehicles, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Human Augmentation, Quantum Computing, Smart Dust and Volumetric Displays will reach mainstream adoption. \nSources: ",

      "text": "An internal Facebook investigation has found it is \"likely\" Russian operatives spent $100,000 on ads with \"divisive messages\" between June 2015 and May 2017. \nA blog post on the issue, which was published on Wednesday, said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages. \nAbout $50,000 of the funds — about 2,200 ads— were potentially related to impacting U.S. politics. The majority of the ads did not reference the U.S. presidential election, voting or a specific candidate. However, the ads focused on \"divisive social and political messages\" about hot-button topics including LGBT rights, race issues, immigration and gun rights. Facebook has shared its findings with U.S. authorities.\nFacebook previously said in April it found evidence some groups used its platform to sway the outcome of the recent election . It did not specify targets or who was behind the attack, but said its own findings did \"not contradict\" a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report in January about Russian efforts to influence the election.\nThe company has introduced technology improvements like machine learning to detect fake accounts, in addition to more tactics to stop the spread of misinformation and fake news. Some solutions also include decreasing the influence of \"spammers\" who spread false news links, lowering the number of articles with \"clickbait\" headlines that exaggerate information or do not present a full picture, and blocking pages from advertising if they share stories that have been flagged as being false.",

      "text": "Enlarge this image These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review. xijian/iStockphoto xijian/iStockphoto These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review.\nxijian/iStockphoto In health care, you could say radiologists have typically had a pretty sweet deal. They make, on average, around $400,000 a year — nearly double what a family doctor makes — and often have less grueling hours. But if you talk with radiologists in training at the University of California, San Francisco, it quickly becomes clear that the once-certain golden path is no longer so secure.\n\"The biggest concern is that we could be replaced by machines,\" says Phelps Kelley, a fourth-year radiology fellow. He's sitting inside a dimly lit reading room, looking at digital images from the CT scan of a patient's chest, trying to figure out why the patient is short of breath.\nBecause MRI and CT scans are now routine procedures and all the data can be stored digitally, the number of images radiologists have to assess has risen dramatically . These days, a radiologist at UCSF will go through anywhere from 20 to 100 scans a day, and each scan can have thousands of images to review.\n\"Radiology has become commoditized over the years,\" Kelley says. \"People don't want interaction with a radiologist, they just want a piece of paper that says what the CT shows.\"\nEnlarge this image Dr. Marc Kohli says that radiologists should embrace artificial intelligence. Courtesy of Christopher Jovais Courtesy of Christopher Jovais Dr. Marc Kohli says that radiologists should embrace artificial intelligence.\nCourtesy of Christopher Jovais \" Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns\"\nThat basic analysis is something he predicts computers will be able to do.\nDr. Bob Wachter, an internist at UCSF and author of The Digital Doctor , says radiology is particularly amenable to takeover by artificial intelligence like machine learning.\n\"Radiology, at its core, is now a human being, based on learning and his or her own experience, looking at a collection of digital dots and a digital pattern and saying 'That pattern looks like cancer or looks like tuberculosis or looks like pneumonia,' \" he says. \"Computers are awfully good at seeing patterns.\"\nJust think about how Facebook software can identify your face in a group photo, or Google's can recognize a stop sign. Big tech companies are betting the same machine learning process — training a computer by feeding it thousands of images — could make it possible for an algorithm to diagnose heart disease or strokes faster and cheaper than a human can.\nUCSF radiologist Dr. Marc Kohli says there is plenty of angst among radiologists today.\nAll Tech Considered Online Retail Boom Means More Warehouse Workers, And Robots To Accompany Them Music Say Goodbye To The Pizza Time Players: Chuck E. Cheese Retires Its Band \"You can't walk through any of our meetings without hearing people talk about machine learning,\" Kohli says.\nBoth Kohli and his colleague Dr. John Mongan are researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology. As part of a UCSF collaboration with GE , Mongan is helping teach machines to distinguish between normal and abnormal chest X-rays so doctors can prioritize patients with life-threatening conditions. He says the people most fearful about AI understand the least about it. From his office just north of Silicon Valley, he compares the climate to that of the dot-com bubble.\n\"People were sure about the way things were going to go,\" Mongan says. \"Webvan had billions of dollars and was going to put all the groceries out of business. There's still a Safeway half a mile from my house. But at the same time, it wasn't all hype.\"\n\" You need them working together\"\nThe reality is this: Dozens of companies, including IBM, Google and GE, are racing to develop formulas that could one day make diagnoses from medical images. It's not an easy task: to write the complex problem-solving formulas, developers need access to a tremendous amount of health data.\nHealth care companies like vRad , which has radiologists analyzing 7 million scans a year, provide anonymized data to partners that develop medical algorithms.\nThe data has been used to \"create algorithms to detect the risk of acute strokes and hemorrhages\" and help off-site radiologists prioritize their work, says Dr. Benjamin Strong, chief medical officer at vRad.\nZebra Medical Vision , an Israeli company, provides algorithms to hospitals across the U.S. that help radiologists predict disease. Chief Medical Officer Eldad Elnekave says computers can detect diseases from images better than humans because they can multitask — say, look for appendicitis while also checking for low bone density.\nEnlarge this image Radiologist John Mongan is researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology. Courtesy of Mark Kohli Courtesy of Mark Kohli Radiologist John Mongan is researching ways to use artificial intelligence in radiology.\nCourtesy of Mark Kohli \"The radiologist can't make 30 diagnoses for every study. But the evidence is there, the information is in the pixels,\" Elnekave says.\nStill, UCSF's Mongan isn't worried about losing his job.\n\"When we're talking about the machines doing things radiologists can't do, we're not talking about a machine where you can just drop an MRI in it and walk away and the answer gets spit out better than a radiologist,\" he says. \"A CT does things better than a radiologist. But that CT scanner by itself doesn't do much good. You need them working together.\"\nIn the short term, Mongan is excited that algorithms could help him prioritize patients and make sure he doesn't miss something. Long term, he says radiologists will spend less time looking at images and more time selecting algorithms and interpreting results.\nKohli says in addition to embracing artificial intelligence, radiologists need to make themselves more visible by coming out of those dimly lit reading rooms.\n\"We're largely hidden from the patients,\" Kohli says. \"We're nearly completely invisible, with the exception of my name shows up on a bill, which is a problem.\"\nWachter believes increasing collaboration between radiologists and doctors is also critical.\nThe Salt Rise Of The Robot Bees: Tiny Drones Turned Into Artificial Pollinators \"At UCSF, we're having conversations about [radiologists] coming out of their room and working with us. The more they can become real consultants, I think that will help,\" he says.\nKelley, the radiology fellow, says young radiologists who don't shy away from AI will have a far more certain future. His analogy? Uber and the taxi business.\n\"If the taxi industry had invested in ride-hailing apps maybe they wouldn't be going out of business and Uber wouldn't be taking them over,\" Kelley says. \"So if we can actually own [AI], then we can maybe benefit from it and not be wiped out by it.\"\nAt least for now, Kelley offers what a computer can't — a diagnosis with a face-to-face explanation.",

      "text": "For Superpowers, Artificial Intelligence Fuels New Global Arms Race Mikhail Klimentyev/AP For many Russian students, the academic year started last Friday with tips on planetary domination from President Vladimir Putin. “Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind,” he said, via live video beamed to 16,000 selected schools. “Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” Putin’s advice is the latest sign of an intensifying race among Russia, China, and the US to accumulate military power based on artificial intelligence. All three countries have proclaimed intelligent machines as vital to the future of their national security. Technologies such as software that can sift intelligence material or autonomous drones and ground vehicles are seen as ways to magnify the power of human soldiers. “The US, Russia, and China are all in agreement that artificial intelligence will be the key technology underpinning national power in the future,” says Gregory C. Allen, a fellow at nonpartisan think tank the Center for a New American Security. He coauthored a recent report commissioned by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that concluded artificial intelligence could shake up armed conflict as significantly as nuclear weapons did . In July, China’s State Council released a detailed strategy designed to make the country “the front-runner and global innovation center in AI” by 2030. It includes pledges to invest in R&D that will “through AI elevate national defense strength and assure and protect national security.” The US, widely recognized as home to the most advanced and vibrant AI development, doesn’t have a prescriptive roadmap like China’s. But for several years the Pentagon has been developing a strategy known as the “Third Offset,” intended to give the US, through weapons powered by smart software, the same sort of advantage over potential adversaries that it once held in nuclear bombs and precision-guided weapons. In April, the Department of Defense established the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team to improve use of AI technologies such as machine vision across the Pentagon. Related Stories It’s Too Late to Stop China From Becoming an AI Superpower Russia lags behind China and the US in sophistication and use of automation and AI, but is expanding its own investments through a military modernization program begun in 2008. The government’s Military Industrial Committee has set a target of making 30 percent of military equipment robotic by 2025. “Russia is behind the curve—they are playing catchup,” says Samuel Bendett, a research analyst who studies the country’s military at the Center for Naval Analyses. The AI race among the world’s three largest military powers differs from earlier competitions like those to deploy nuclear weapons or stealth technology because much artificial intelligence technology can be used for both commercial and military applications. Algorithms good at searching holiday photos can be repurposed to scour spy satellite imagery, for example, while the control software needed for an autonomous minivan is much like that required for a driverless tank. Many recent advances in developing and deploying artificial intelligence emerged from research from companies such as Google. China’s AI strategy attempts to directly link commercial and defense developments in AI. For example, a national lab dedicated to making China more competitive in machine learning that opened in February is operated by Baidu, the country’s leading search engine. Another partner in the project is Beihang University, a leading center in military drones blocked from exporting certain items by the US Department of Commerce due to national security concerns. The US government is less able to simply order cooperation from the tech sector. Defense Secretary James Mattis admitted on a recent West Coast trip that took in the offices of Amazon and Google that his department needs to do a better job of tapping into commercial AI advances. The Pentagon plans to boost spending on its DIUx project, created by the Obama administration to help smaller tech companies partner with the military. Russia’s smaller tech industry, compared with the US and China, puts it at a disadvantage in the AI arms race. But it retains a strong academic tradition in science and technology. And advanced technology isn’t everything—it also matters what you do with what you’ve got. Bendett of the Center for Naval Analyses says Russia has demonstrated in recent conflicts in Syria and Ukraine that it can do much even without the best technology. Russian drones are much cheaper, and have smaller ranges, than those of the US, but have been extremely effective, he says. Allen suggests that Russia may be willing to use machine learning and AI more aggressively than its rivals in intelligence and propaganda campaigns. Automation could enhance the power of hacking and social-media campaigns like those deployed in the 2016 US election , he says. Speaking last Friday, Putin suggested that Russian gains in AI could make the world safer—apparently a nod to the arguably stabilizing effect of mutual nuclear deterrence. “It would be strongly undesirable if someone wins a monopolist position,” he said. The AI arms race may bring new technologies to the world’s largest militaries, but many dynamics of international power could be the same.

      "title": "What are algorithms?",
      "text": "ALGORITHMS are everywhere. They play the stockmarket, decide whether you can have a mortgage and may one day drive your car for you. They search the internet when commanded, stick carefully chosen advertisements into the sites you visit and decide what prices to show you in online shops. As Uber and Waymo will tell you, they can be the subjects of legal arguments; they cause regulatory worries too (earlier this month a group of luminaries called for a ban on battlefield robots running algorithms designed to kill people). PageRank—the algorithm that powers Google’s search results—has made its inventors very rich indeed. Algorithmically curated “filter bubbles” may even affect the way a country votes. But what exactly are algorithms, and what makes them so powerful?\nAn algorithm is, essentially, a brainless way of doing clever things. It is a set of precise steps that need no great mental effort to follow but which, if obeyed exactly and mechanically, will lead to some desirable outcome. Long division and column addition are examples that everyone is familiar with—if you follow the procedure, you are guaranteed to get the right answer. So is the strategy, rediscovered thousands of times every year by schoolchildren bored with learning mathematical algorithms, for playing a perfect game of noughts and crosses. The brainlessness is key: each step should be as simple and as free from ambiguity as possible. Cooking recipes and driving directions are algorithms of a sort. But instructions like “stew the meat until tender” or “it’s a few miles down the road” are too vague to follow without at least some interpretation.\n 3 Algorithms are closely associated with computers and code. They do not have to be. Alan Turing, a British mathematician who did a great deal of pioneering work on how to treat algorithms with mathematical rigour, once wrote a fairly complicated chess-playing algorithm on paper. He tested it in a match against a friend, scanning down the list of instructions with every move and doing what his instructions told him. But, as Turing’s opponent conceded, humans generally find such repetitive, mindless work boring and frustrating (there was so much paperwork and arithmetic involved that it reportedly took about half an hour to play each move). Computers, though, excel at quickly churning through dull, repetitive tasks such as “add these two numbers”, “decide if this number is bigger than that one” and “store the answer over there.” It is, in fact, the only thing that they are capable of doing.\nFor that reason, computers have allowed humans to build—and execute—ever bigger and more baroque algorithmical constructs. And it turns out that, like Lego bricks, piling up enough simple instructions allows you to build far more intricate and interesting things than is apparent at first. Every computer program, from Chrome to Call of Duty to a climate model, is, at its root, nothing more than a big pile of algorithms being executed at high speed. In a nice bit of symmetry, some of the most advanced algorithms are not written by humans at all, but by other algorithms. Machine learning is a fashionable artificial-intelligence technique used to teach computers to do things that people can do, such as decode speech or recognise faces, but which humans cannot explain in a sufficiently mechanical algorithmic fashion. So a machine-learning algorithm does the translation work for them. It ingests lots of examples of the thing in question—spoken language, say, or pictures of faces—which have been labelled by humans. It then produces another algorithm that recognises them reliably. Brainlessness, in other words, is no impediment to intelligence.\nPrevious The roots of Afghanistan’s tribal tensions Next Why Norway may leave $65bn worth of oil in the ground",

      "text": "August 15, 2017 9:00 AM Above: Eugene Ciurana, founder and CEO of Cosmify Image Credit: Meltwater \nMedia intelligence company Meltwater announced today that it has acquired Cosmify , a San Francisco-based data analysis startup. The price of the acquisition has not been disclosed, but Meltwater told VentureBeat that it has bought the startup’s intellectual property (IP) and is bringing the Cosmify team onboard. \nThis is Meltwater’s fourth acquisition in nine months. The company has already acquired Hong Kong-based big data solution Klarity, Oxford University spinout Wrapidity, and Encore Alerts, a U.S.-based media monitoring company. It is about to close its fifth acquisition with Canada’s Infomart. \nThis string of acquisitions isn’t surprising in light of Meltwater’s unique business trajectory. Jorn Lyseggen founded the company in 2001 in Oslo, Norway, bootstrapping it with a $15,000 research grant from the Norwegian government. The founder and CEO never took a dime from VCs , fueling the company’s growth with talent instead. Today, Meltwater is headquartered in San Francisco and has 1,500 employees across 55 offices globally. \nThe company claims to have more than 25,000 customers, which include the George Washington University, the Denver Broncos, and the Apache Software Foundation. \nThe business initially focused on alerting companies about media mentions but has since expanded to include additional sources, such as social media, blogs, forums, and reviews. But Aditya Jami, Meltwater’s senior director of engineering and head of AI, says that this is only part of the data there is to track. According to him, extracting information from internal data lakes is just as key. \n“That’s where Cosmify comes in,” he told VentureBeat. “It supports PDFs, spreadsheets, cloud drives, calendars, and more, and can therefore find interesting insights from other file types, no matter the format.” \nCosmify founder Eugene Ciurana launched his first machine learning company, Summly, in 2011 with cofounder Nick D’Aloisio and sold it to Yahoo for $30 million two years later. He then joined forces with cofounders Dr. Ana Nelson, Connor Goodwolf, and Sriram Krishnan to launch Cosmify in 2014. Bart Swanson of Horizons Ventures and MuleSoft founder Ross Mason are among Cosmify’s investors. \nWith the talent and IP Meltwater is ramping up, the “ Google Slayer” is honing its edge over the search giant. “We are kind of like the Google Alerts on steroids,” said Jami. “Google Alerts only focuses on news. We also have social, premium content, print, radio, SEC filings, patents, trademarks…” \nWhen asked whether the company is considering other acquisitions, Jami replied, “There are a couple of companies that are in the pipeline.” VB Recommendations ",

      "text": "Facebook has turned over all information about ads \"likely\" purchased by Russian operatives to special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a report.\nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the social media giant had sent the former FBI director data including copies of the ads and the identity of the buyers. That report followed news that an internal Facebook investigation found it is agents of the Kremlin may have spent $100,000 on ads with \"divisive messages\" between June 2015 and May 2017.\nA Facebook blog post published on Wednesday said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages.\nMueller is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The investigation has dogged and frustrated , who has called it a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax.\"\nGetty Images Robert Mueller According to Facebook, about $50,000 of the funds — about 2,200 ads — were potentially related to affecting U.S. politics. The majority of the ads did not reference the presidential election, voting or a specific candidate. However, the ads focused on \"divisive social and political messages\" about hot-button topics including LGBT rights, race, immigration and gun rights. Facebook has shared its findings with U.S. authorities.\nFacebook said in April that it found evidence some groups used its platform to sway the outcome of the election . It did not specify targets or who was behind the attack, but said its own findings did \"not contradict\" a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report in January about Russian efforts to influence the election.\nThe company has introduced technology improvements like machine learning to detect fake accounts, in addition to more tactics to stop the spread of misinformation and fake news. Some solutions also include decreasing the influence of \"spammers\" who spread false news links, lowering the number of articles with \"clickbait\" headlines that exaggerate information or do not present a full picture, and blocking pages from advertising if they share stories that have been flagged as being false.\n—Reuters and CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.",

      "text": "AI Will Soon Identify Protesters With Their Faces Partly Concealed A new paper has troubling implications. {{contributor.full_name}} \nProtesters regularly wear disguises like bandanas and sunglasses to prevent being identified, either by law enforcement or internet sleuths . Their efforts may be no match for artificial intelligence, however. \nA new paper to be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW) introduces a deep-learning algorithm—a subset of machine learning used to detect and model patterns in large heaps of data—that can identify an individual even when part of their face is obscured. The system was able to correctly identify a person concealed by a scarf 67 percent of the time when they were photographed against a \"complex\" background, which better resembles real-world conditions. \nThe deep-learning algorithm works in a novel way. The researchers, from Cambridge University, India's National Institute of Technology, and the Indian Institute of Science, first outlined 14 key areas of the face, and then trained a deep-learning model to identify them. The algorithm connects the points into a \"star-net structure,\" and uses the angles between the points to identify a face. The algorithm can still identify those angles even when part of a person's mug is obscured, by disguises including caps, scarves, and glasses. Image: University of Cambridge/ National Institute of Technology/ Indian Institute of Science \nThe research has troubling implications for protestors and other dissidents, who often work to make sure they aren't ID'd at protests and other demonstrations by covering their faces with scarves or by wearing sunglasses. \"To be honest when I was trying to come up with this method, I was just trying to focus on criminals,\" Amarjot Singh, one of the researchers behind the paper and a Ph.D student at Cambridge University, told me on a phone call. \nSingh said he isn't sure how to prevent the technology from being used by authoritarian regimes in the future. \"I actually don't have a good answer for how that can be stopped,\" he said. \"It has to be regulated somehow … it should only be used for people who want to use it for good stuff.\" How to guarantee algorithms like the one Singh developed don't get into nefarious hands is an ongoing problem. \nZeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a writer at The New York Times , discussed the dubious implications of the algorithm described in the paper on Twitter: \"too many worry about what AI—as if some independent entity—will do to us. Too few people worry what *power* will do *with* AI,\" she wrote in a tweet . \nDon't fret yet, though. While the algorithm described in the paper was fairly impressive, it's definitely not reliable enough to be used by law enforcement or anyone else. But the researchers behind the paper have provided future academics with an important gift to do their work. One of the problems with training machine learning models is that there simply aren't enough quality databases out there to train them on. But this paper provides researchers in the field with two different databases to train algorithms to do similar tasks, each with 2,000 images. \n\"This is a minor paper; narrow, conditional results. But it's the direction & this will be done with nation-state data—not by grad students,\" Tufecki wrote in a followup tweet . \nThe system described in the paper isn't capable of identifying people wearing all types of disguises. Singh pointed out to me that the rigid Guy Fawkes masks often donned by members of hacking collective Anonymous would be able to evade the algorithm, for example. He hopes one day though to be able to ID people even wearing rigid masks. \"We are trying to find ways to explore that problem,\" he told me over the phone. It's worth noting that experimental algorithms can already identify people with 99 percent accuracy based on how they walk. \nSingh and his colleagues have big plans for the algorithm in the future. They want to make the tech work in real-time locally, without needing a Wi-Fi connection. That way law enforcement could use a camera to identify someone wearing a scarf or other disguise without needing to feed data to a remote server over a Wi-Fi connection. The team also wants to train the algorithm on a larger dataset of people, especially of different races. \nThis isn't the first research of its kind. An earlier paper published in 2014 puts forth an automated algorithm that can recognize faces even when they're obscured (though the new paper uses a different technique and a larger data set). Another paper , from way back in 2008, analyzes the effect disguises, like different hairstyles, have on facial recognition algorithms. \nLuckily, plenty of research has also been done about how to confuse or evade facial recognition tech. A team at Carnegie Mellon University crafted glasses that could trip up a facial recognition algorithm last year, for example. \nIn the future, we might see a competition between AI experts (possibly employed by governments) trying to create ever-more powerful facial recognition algorithms, and other researchers, trying to figure out how to evade them.

      "text": "Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam More Facebook ( FB ) on Monday took another step towards curbing the distribution of so-called “fake news.”\nEffective immediately, the company will stop business pages, which the social network refers to as Pages, from advertising on Facebook for an unspecified period of time if they repeatedly shared stories ultimately deemed as “fake news.”\n“False news damages the trust of people who are on Facebook,” Facebook product director Rob Leathern told Yahoo Finance. “We don’t want pages that post [false] news to build out audiences and get more distribution on Facebook. So, we’ve decided to add this to the list of things to help that informed community.”\nFacebook declined to specify exactly how many times a Page has to share false news stories before it triggers the temporary advertising ban. The social network also declined to specify exactly how long bans will last.\n“We don’t want to share that,” added Leathern. “We don’t want Pages to game the system.”\nMonday’s announcement is the latest in a string of moves Facebook has made in an effort to combat false news and hoaxes throughout the past year. In May, the social network updated its News Feed so users see fewer posts and ads that link to “low-quality” web sites that potentially feature false news. Earlier this month, Facebook started using advanced machine learning techniques to detect potential hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers. The tech giant also began showing fact-checking results under stories.\nMonday’s announcement comes nine months after last year’s controversial U.S. presidential election, after which Facebook was heavily criticized for playing a role in distributing misleading news coverage. The issue again come to a head this May when French voters encountered a slew of false news stories ahead of that country’s presidential election.\nIn June, the German parliament approved a bill enforcing fines on social media companies that fail to remove postings containing hate speech within 24 hours of receiving a complaint — a move ostensibly done to avoid similar problems before the country’s national election in September.\nMore from JP:\nMeet Uber’s pick for its next CEO The Essential Phone is a beautiful alternative to Apple’s iPhone Amazon’s new Instant Pickup could help it dominate another industry ‘An affront to America:’ Tech leaders condemn Charlottesville violence Facebook diversity chief: ‘We are not in the business of giving away jobs’ JP Mangalindan is a senior correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

      "text": "Apple iPhone event set for September 12th Posted DeepL schools other online translators with clever machine learning Apple has set its annual iPhone event for September 12, as reported by The Wall Street Journal and rumored previously . Multiple sources have also told TechCrunch that this is the current date Apple is aiming for. But, as always, it doesn’t announce early in case it needs to shift the date based on whether it feels it’s ready. The additional factor, as indicated in the Journal, is whether the Steve Jobs Auditorium on its new campus is ready to host or not. \nThe event will likely play host to more than just the launch of new iPhones, though that will obviously be the headline product focus. Apple is said to be readying a new iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, to be launched alongside a new iPhone 8 (or whatever it ends up being called) which will apparently feature a nearly bezel-free design. \nOther features said to be available in the forthcoming top-end iPhone, which will also mark the 10th anniversary of the iconic device, include facial recognition for unlocking, and an OLED display which will improve power efficiency and rendering of true black in graphics and images. Rumors also point to wireless charging as a potential feature addition. \nAt the event, it’s also been reported that we’ll see the introduction of a successor to the 4th generation Apple TV – one which will include support for 4K and HDR image output. A new Apple Watch, potentially including onboard support for a dedicated cellular connection, is also likely to make an appearance, and we’ll almost certainly hear more about HomePod, Apple’s forthcoming smart speaker, which the company revealed in June at its annual developers conference. \nAs with any of Apple’s events, things could change at the last minute, but it looks like September 12 is nearly locked in. Expectations will be very high for the 10th anniversary iPhone, so you can bet this will be one of, if not the most closely watched launch events in the company’s history. 0 ",

      "text": "SQL is about as easy as it gets in the world of programming, and yet its learning curve is still steep enough to prevent many people from interacting with relational databases. Salesforce’s AI research team took it upon itself to explore how machine learning might be able to open doors for those without knowledge of SQL.\nTheir recent paper , Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from Natural Language using Reinforcement Learning, builds on sequence to sequence models typically employed in machine translation. A reinforcement learning twist allowed the team to obtain promising results translating natural language database queries into SQL.\nIn practice this means that you could simply ask who the winningest team in college football is and an appropriate database could be automatically queried to tell you that it is in fact the University of Michigan.\n“We don’t actually have just one way of writing a query the correct way,” Victor Zhong, one of the Salesforce researchers who worked on the project, explained to me in an interview. “If I give a natural language question, there might be two or three ways to write the query. We use reinforcement learning to encourage use of queries that obtain same result.”\nYou can imagine how machine translation problems can quickly become massively complex with large vocabularies. The more you can limit the number of possible translations for each missing word, the simpler your problem becomes. To this avail, Salesforce opted to limit its vocabulary to words used in database labels, the words in the question being asked and the words typically used in SQL queries.\nThe idea of democratizing SQL isn’t new. Startups like ClearGraph, which was recently acquired by Tableau, have made it their business to open up data with English rather than SQL.\n“Some models perform execution on a database itself,” added Zhong. “But there’s potential privacy concerns if you’re asking a question about Social Security numbers.”\nOutside of the paper itself, Salesforce’s biggest contribution here comes in the form of the WikiSQL data set it constructed to aid in building its model. First HTML tables were collected from Wikipedia. These tables became the basis for randomly generated SQL queries. These queries were used to form questions that were then passed off to humans for paraphrasing over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each paraphrasing was verified twice with additional human guidance. The resulting data set is the largest such data set in existence.\nFeatured Image: Bloomberg / Contributor/Getty Images ",

      "text": "Brick-and-mortar chains look to number crunchers as saviors Job postings for the position have reached an all-time high \nDespite an onslaught of bankruptcies, store closures and layoffs, there’s one retail job that’s still in hot demand: data scientists. \nThe battle against e-commerce is putting new pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers to fix up stores and deliver a more pleasant experience for shoppers. And that means studying data -- lots and lots of data. Department-store chains and other businesses have tons of information that they could use to refine their customer service and get more revenue from shoppers; they just need someone to help them go through it. \n“Every company collects mountains of data: some valuable, most not,” said Jay Samit, a vice chairman at technology consulting firm Deloitte Digital. “It’s the data scientist’s job to distinguish between the two.” \nData scientists aren’t just in hot demand in the retail industry. Job postings and job searches for the role have reached an all-time high, according to the website Indeed. Harvard Business Review has called the field “the sexiest job of the 21st century,” and employers across industries and government agencies have scrambled to add such workers to their ranks. \nPart of the appeal: When companies dig into data, they can use artificial intelligence and so-called machine learning to help do some of the lifting. \nThese jobs often require a hefty resume: a doctorate in data science, knowledge of the Python language and strong interpersonal skills. DJ Patil, the first U.S. chief data scientist, is credited with helping coin the term while working at LinkedIn Corp. Patil says that using data to fix problems is something that hasn’t come naturally to all businesses, but it’s key to the strategy of most successful companies in the past decade. \n“Retail didn’t think machine learning and artificial intelligence was a big deal until Amazon started crushing them,” he said in an interview. “That’s something that’s super obvious to data people, but not to the business people.” Berry Boom \nNow businesses are starting to shift, and that includes retailers. There’s still plenty of opportunity to improve brick-and-mortar shopping. Even with the rise of Amazon.com Inc., U.S. consumers still make about 85 percent of their purchases at physical stores. \nBut competition is tougher than ever, and consumers often need a bit of a nudge to make a purchasing decision. That’s where the data comes in. \nIn 2014, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. studied weather patterns and found that people were more likely to buy berries when it was lightly windy and below 80 degrees outside. By narrowing down this trend down to ZIP codes, stores were able to rearrange displays and increase local digital ads to maximize sales. \nThe effort increased berry sales by over 300 percent, according to Steve Brown, a former Intel Corp. executive who now serves as a technology consultant. \nRetailers have traditionally made their decisions based on the gut sense or experience of their managers. That’s guided where to place items in store aisles and how much to price products. Fewer Mistakes \nBut data helps assure you don’t make a mistake, Samit said. And that can be the difference between having a business that’s thriving and one that’s failing. \n“Data is your friend,” he said. “Data has no ego. Data will never steer you wrong.” \nMost retailers don’t have access to the breadth of information available to a Wal-Mart. And the woes of department-store chains may be hard to solve with better insights alone. Sluggish mall traffic and deep discounting have roiled the industry. What’s more, many shoppers would simply prefer to spend their money on travel or technology. \nBut job postings from Macy’s Inc., Nordstrom Inc. and VF Corp. suggest that retailers are serious about using data science to improve their results. \nMacy’s, the largest department-store company, has been especially vocal about expanding its data team. Chief Strategy Innovation Officer Justin MacFarlane explained the push to investors at a meeting in June. \n“Five years ago, if you were to say there was a team of Ph.D. data scientists at Macy’s that are thinking about our most strategic problems, people would have thought you are crazy,” he said. \nBut the team has come together “very, very quickly,” MacFarlane said. “And the real power of data and data analytics is focusing those resources and that talent on the core business.” ‘Not Sexy’ \nIt’s not always easy for retailers to get data scientists on board. With companies in many industries seeking out the workers, the best employees often would prefer to work at a tech company or a Wall Street firm. \nData scientists might be put off by a sense that retail is dying, said Paul Chatlos, a data-science recruiter for Smith Hanley Associates. \n“It’s not sexy,” he said. “Everyone wants to work for tech, e-commerce and online.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "text": "Tech Guide Facebook says 'likely' Russian operation spent money on ads with divisive political messages An internal Facebook investigation has found it is \"likely\" Russian operatives spent $100,000 on ads with \"divisive messages.\" About half of the funds potentially purchased ads intended to influence U.S. politics. Though most of the ads did not reference the U.S. presidential election or a specific candidate, they did mention \"divisive social and political messages\" about subjects including LGBT rights, race issues, immigration and gun control. 1 Hour Ago | 00:46 \nAn internal Facebook investigation has found it is \"likely\" Russian operatives spent $100,000 on ads with \"divisive messages\" between June 2015 and May 2017. \nA blog post on the issue, which was published on Wednesday, said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages. \nAbout $50,000 of the funds — about 2,200 ads— were potentially related to impacting U.S. politics. The majority of the ads did not reference the U.S. presidential election, voting or a specific candidate. However, the ads focused on \"divisive social and political messages\" about hot-button topics including LGBT rights, race issues, immigration and gun rights. Facebook has shared its findings with U.S. authorities. \nFacebook previously said in April it found evidence some groups used its platform to sway the outcome of the recent election . It did not specify targets or who was behind the attack, but said its own findings did \"not contradict\" a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report in January about Russian efforts to influence the election. \nThe company has introduced technology improvements like machine learning to detect fake accounts, in addition to more tactics to stop the spread of misinformation and fake news. Some solutions also include decreasing the influence of \"spammers\" who spread false news links, lowering the number of articles with \"clickbait\" headlines that exaggerate information or do not present a full picture, and blocking pages from advertising if they share stories that have been flagged as being false.",

      "text": "744 shares \nStock photo vendors might not be all that screwed up in the end. Only a week after Google released a paper detailing how its researchers built an algorithm that automatically removes watermarks from stock photos, Shutterstock has already put together an antidote. \nTaking a cue from the internet giant, the popular stock photo distributor managed to reverse engineer Google’s software in order to stop copyright thieves from editing out watermarks and using their images for free. \nTo pull this off, its engineers built a smart watermark technology that counteracts the algorithm by deliberately inserting minor inconsistencies in the watermark patterns. The solution purportedly uses machine learning to continuously confuse Google’s software. \n“The challenge was protecting images without degrading the image quality,” said Shutterstock CTO Martin Brodbeck. “Changing the opacity and location of a watermark does not make it more secure, however changing the geometry does.” \nUnlike its previous anti-theft measures, the website’s new technology introduced several variables to its watermarks structures to make it difficult for programs to identify recurring patterns. \n“The result was a watermark randomizer that our engineering team developed so that no two watermarks are the same,” Brodbeck explains. “The shapes vary per image and include contributor names. By creating a completely different watermark for each image, it makes it hard to truly identify the shape.” \nAccording to the Shutterstock CTO, Google has already tested the new solution and found it to be functional. You can head to this page to see how the updated watermark protector works in action.",

      "text": "Google and ProPublica have created a new tool that tracks hate crimes throughout the United States.\nGoogle News Lab is developing a new tool powered by machine learning, titled by “ Documenting Hate News Ending ,” which tracks every hate crime reported across 50 states using data collected from February 2017 onward.\nThe tool is being developed as part of the “Documenting Hate project,” which was launched this January by ProPublica. It is supported by news and other digital media organizations, universities, and civil rights groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nThe tool features a list of articles harvested from various, largely left-leaning websites, including HuffPost, BuzzFeed, Mic, Think Progress, and even pro-Antifa publication Unicorn Booty. It runs Google News stories and filters them through Google’s natural language analysis tools to confine the results to America.\nHigh-profile conservative websites like Fox News have little to no presence on the tool.\nAccording to TechCrunch , Google is using the project as a “starting point” for documenting and studying hate crimes. The publication claims that despite the fact that the FBI documents hate crimes, crimes committed at the local and state-level are overlooked because they “fail to report their own incidents, making the data incomplete at best.”\n“The feed is generated from news articles that cover events suggestive of hate crime, bias or abuse — such as anti-semitic graffiti or local court reports about incidents,” says Gogle News Lab Data editor Simon Rogers. “And we are monitoring it to look out for errant stories that slip in, i.e., searches for phrases that just include the word ‘hate’ — it hasn’t happened yet but we will be paying close attention.”\nThere’s no word yet on how debunked hate crimes and hoaxes are filtered through the system.\nIan Miles Cheong is a journalist and outspoken media critic.

      "text": "Why John Deere Just Spent $305 Million on a Lettuce-Farming Robot Blue River Technology Look out weeds. Tractor giant John Deere just spent $305 million to acquire a startup that makes robots capable of identifying unwanted plants, and shooting them with deadly, high-precision squirts of herbicide . John Deere, established in 1837 to manufacture hand tools, announced it had acquired Blue River Technology, founded in 2011, late Wednesday. Deere already sells technology that uses GPS to automate the movements of farm vehicles across a field to sub-inch accuracy. John Stone, an executive in the company's intelligent-solutions group, says Blue River’s computer-vision technology will help Deere's equipment view and understand the crops it is working with. “Taking care of each individual plant unlocks a lot of economic value for farmers,” Stone says. The deal highlights the growing appetite for high tech in agriculture. Many companies are using drones to help farmers by collecting data on crops to plan spraying or other operations. Stone says that Blue River’s technology can make a larger impact on productivity because it makes decisions up close, on the ground. Pesticides and other chemicals are traditionally applied blindly across a whole field or crop. Blue River’s systems are agricultural sharp shooters that direct chemicals only where they are needed. Related Stories Men Will Lose the Most Jobs to Robots, and That’s OK The startup’s robots are towed behind a regular tractor like conventional spraying equipment. But they have cameras on board that use machine-learning software to distinguish between crops and weeds, and automated sprayers to target unwanted plants. The company says its first product, LettuceBot, already has a hand in roughly 10 percent of US lettuce production. It is used on fields with young lettuce plants, targeting weeds as well as plants that are too small, or growing on top of one another. This season Blue River tested a second system for cotton farmers, ahead of a planned commercial launch in 2018. That system can target weeds with squirts of herbicide no larger than a postage stamp. Willy Pell, director of new technology at Blue River, says the system has shown it can reduce herbicide use by 90 percent. Blue River, which has roughly 60 employees, will operate as an independent brand, from its base in Sunnyvale, California. Pell says that the company plans to develop versions of its technology for other crops such as soybeans and corn. Blue River also wants to deploy its computer-vision software in harvesting and seed planting equipment so it can adapt to variations in the size of soil clods or corn plants across a field.

      "text": "share The AI community has been abuzz today on Twitter after one of its own was elevated in an unusual fashion. Stanford University grad Alexandre Robicquet is a researcher in machine vision who works in the lab of Google X founder Sebastian Thrun. But he’s also helping front a new Yves Saint Laurent ad campaign, with his face — and profession — popping up in posters and photoshoots. Artificial intelligence? It’s so hot right now . The campaign itself is for a new fragrance dubbed Y, and in a 30-second TV spot posted online today, Robicquet is seen riding a motorbike, delivering some sort of talk to a rapturous audience, and, yes, even doing a bit of coding. (For like two seconds.) Even the slogan is AI-appropriate: “Everything starts with a why.” The hype of being an AI research scientist nowadays. pic.twitter.com/karJtj6yIG — Antoine MIECH (@antoine77340) August 30, 2017 Robicquet is actually one of three faces fronting the new campaign , alongside rapper Loyle Carner and sculptor David Alexander Flinn. Of course, no one is saying he was chosen for the role just because he works in AI, and at the end of the day he is only one guy. (One very attractive guy, it goes without saying.) But it seems at least a little bit culturally significant that working in this once-geeky and obscure field now has enough cultural cachet to give a high-end perfume an air of mystique. Mark Riedl, an associate professor at Georgia Tech who works with AI and storytelling and tweeted about the campaign, says it does seem like part of a wider trend. “I think we are starting to see awareness of AI and machine learning creep into broader cultural awareness,” Riedl tells The Verge. “ With all the press (negative and positive) surrounding AI in the press, there is a general level of awareness of AI that we haven’t before.” Although he adds: “This may be a one-off — basically an attractive man who also happens to work on AI.” Sure, your arXiv paper is highly cited. But are you the face of a new fragrance? https://t.co/ragJSj7cgv — Mark Riedl (@mark_riedl) August 31, 2017 It seems, perhaps, that “AI researcher” might become something akin to that movie cliche of the lonely male architect ; a profession that screenwriters believe is shorthand for intelligence, creativity, and sensitivity. As Cracked puts it , architects are beloved by the movie biz because they seem to combine “the passion and creativity of an artist [with] the ‘groundedness’ of a businessman.” Working in AI conveys some of the same signals, as well as a sprinkling of that typically-21st-century archetype: the visionary tech founder. Robicquet’s commercial certainly hits all of these themes, but, I think, AI has further to go. Wait until someone starts chatting about recurrent neural nets and backpropagation in a Hollywood rom-com. Then we’ll know AI has really gone mainstream. Next Up In TL;DR ",

      "text": "twitter These are the startups you should have on your radar. Picture: Brandless \nWhile much of Silicon Valley has been consumed by the drama at Uber, tech’s most valuable startup, a whole new class of companies launched in the first half of 2017 hoping to change the world, become the next unicorn — or just build a successful business. \nBusiness Insider spoke to founders and venture capitalists and took a look at funding data to identify some of the startups that had the biggest starts in 2017. Some names on the list are officially launching out of stealth, while others are still in their early stages. \nFrom a VR arcade company to a recycling startup with mysterious ties to Tesla, here are 16 of the top startups to launch this year: Essential, from the creator of Android, is gunning for Apple and Samsung. Andy Rubin, Essential's founder and CEO. Picture: Brian Ach/Getty Images \nWhat it is: A consumer gadget company founded by Andy Rubin that's designed a new smartphone to challenge Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy devices. It calls that gadget, simply, the Essential Phone. \nRubin is best known as the guy who created Android, sold it to Google, and nurtured it into the most popular smartphone operating system on the planet. He left Google back in 2014, founded a startup incubator, and then helped launch Essential under its umbrella. \nAfter working on Essential's phone in stealth for years, Rubin unveiled it in May. The device is just the start of the startup's ambitions . The company also has a smart home hub in the works that's intended to control everything from smart light bulbs to connected toasters. \nFunding: $US330 million from Redpoint Ventures and others, according to Bloomberg . Brandless wants to be the new 'Procter & Gamble for millennials.' Brandless' founders, Tina Sharkey and Ido Leffler. Picture: Brandless \nWhat it is: A consumer packaged goods company that offers everything from dish soap to olive oil to kitchen knives. The company offers all of its products for a single low price of $US3 each through its website. \nOfficially launched in early July , Brandless is making a bet that you don't care as much about the brands you consume as you think. None of its products are from name brands; instead they all carry its 'brandless' private label. Rather than having a big logo emblazoned on them with a bunch of marketing hype, the packages Brandless' products come in just say what the products are and list their attributes. \nFunding: $US50 million from investors including Cowboy Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, and Google Ventures. Forward is a new doctor's office that's like an Apple Store meets 'Westworld'. Forward's automated body scanner. Picture: Forward \nWhat it is: A futuristic medical practice designed by Google and Uber alums that's been described as a doctor's office from 'Westworld.' \nLaunched in January , Forward offers a futuristic take on the popular concierge medical practice model, complete with state-of-the-art diagnostics tools, an artificial-intelligence system that listens and takes notes for physicians, and a pricey $US149 monthly membership. \nFunding: Unknown. NomadicVR thinks the future of entertainment will be an arcade. Nomadic VR's immersive arcade. Picture: NomadicVR \nWhat it is: A creator of virtual reality arcades. Customers can strap on VR headsets and PC backpacks and roam around rooms in virtual reality. \nNomadicVR emerged from stealth in March. It's got good timing -- many investors are betting that VR will be a big part of entertainment's future. The early reviews of NomadicVR's arcade experience is that it's ' mind-blowing ' and will convert even the sceptics. \nFunding: $US6 million from Horizons Ventures, Maveron, Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital, among others. Hound Labs thinks it can smell pot on your breath. The Hound marijuana breathalyzer. Picture: Hound Labs and Melia Robinson/Business Insider \nWhat it is: A startup that's developing one of the first breathalyzers for weed. Its device, dubbed the Hound, detects and measures THC -- a chemical compound responsible for marijuana's psychoactive effects. \nWhen users blow into the Hound's mouthpiece, their breath passes into a single-use, disposable cartridge. A chemical reaction separates the THC molecules from the rest of their breath, allowing an automated mechanism to calculate the amount of THC present. The company just started its first clinical trial of the Hound, and it expects to release the gadget by the end of the year. \nHound Labs is initially planning to market its product to law enforcement agencies. The startup's work has gained the backing of Benchmark, a Silicon Valley venture firm that was also and early investor in Facebook, Snapchat, and Uber. \nFunding: $US8.1 million from Benchmark. DeepMap wants to help self-driving cars 'see' the road. DeepMap's team. Picture: Accel \nWhat it is: A startup that's building maps for autonomous vehicles. \nOne of the hardest parts of developing self-driving cars is making sure they have the data they need to be able to 'see' the roads. That's where DeepMap comes in. Founded by a team of ex-Googlers , it plans to licence its maps to large-scale automakers. \nDeepMap isn't the only company trying to tackle maps for the cars of the future. But because it's a small startup, it doesn't have the same conflicts a lot of automakers have and can licence its technology to anyone. \nFunding: $US32 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Accel. Virta Health wants to reverse type 2 diabetes. A Virta patient talking to her health coach. Picture: Virta Health \nWhat it is: An online medical company focused on creating individualized diabetes treatments. \nThe latest venture from Sami Inkinen, who founded Trulia and Zillow, was inspired by his personal life . Virta Health hopes to tackle Type 2 diabetes, which Inkinen himself was diagnosed with in 2004. \nAided by physicians, coaches and algorithms, each regimen Virta designs for its clients 'addresses the underlying biochemistry of diabetes and shifts the paradigm from management to reversal,' Virta says. The aim is to do all that without medications or surgery. \nFunding: $US37 million from Venrock, Allen & Company, Obvious Ventures, and others. \nWebsite: www.virtahealth.com Atrium LTS wants to revolutionise the legal industry with software -- and it's backed by almost 100 investors. The Atrium team. Picture: Atrium LTS \nWhat it is: A software company that wants to help automate legal workflows. \nJustin.TV cofounder Justin Kan is back with his next act, Atrium. The company has offered a somewhat vague vision of 'revolutionising' legal services. \n'We believe the technology we build can provide a better experience for legal clients than they have thought possible, increasing communication and speed of service,' an Atrium job description reads. \nNearly 100 investors have backed the company in what TechCrunch said was one of the largest 'party rounds' ever seen in the Valley. \nFunding: $US10.5 million from nearly 100 investors. \nWebsite: www.atriumlts.com Cover wants to bring small, pre-fabricated living spaces into the backyards of the country's hottest real estate markets. One of Cover's pre-fab houses. Picture: Cover \nWhat it is: An architecture-meets-tech company that is planning, designing and manufacturing living spaces using machine learning and methods borrowed from the aerospace and automotive industries. \nCover unveiled its first pre-fab home this spring . The company can make a range of spaces, including backyard studios, in-law units, home offices, and guest rooms, all collectively known as accessory dwelling units . These units, which range in size from 300 to 1,200 square feet, are meant to increase the housing supply in cities where the cost of living is increasingly prohibitive. \nFunding: $US1.6 million from General Catalyst and Khosla Ventures. Packagd wants to be the QVC for millennials. An Unboxed host pitching new headphones. Picture: Packagd \nWhat it is: A media company that wants to build a retail business similar to QVC's , but around unboxing videos. \nStarted by the former CTO of Hulu, Packagd streams live video of its stars unboxing and talking about new products. Consumers can watch the videos through Packagd's apps. And they can buy touted products by just tapping on an 'add to cart' button as the videos play. \nThe company's first app, Unboxed, focuses only on tech products. The company has already struck deals with big names like Microsoft and Best Buy to help sponsor it. \nFunding: $US7.5 million from Kleiner Perkins, Forerunner Ventures, and GV. Voyage wants to make self-driving taxis affordable -- and maybe even free. Voyage's self-driving taxi. Picture: Voyage \nWhat it is: A self-driving car startup that plans to build a fleet of self-driving taxis using retrofitted mass-production automobiles. \nThe company hopes that by using already existing cars it will be able to get autonomous vehicles on the road sooner than developing them from the ground up. \nVoyage is doing more than just developing self-driving car technology. It's working on ways for passengers to interact with its vehicles -- telling them when to stop or what music to play -- using just their voices. \nThe company was spun out of Udacity , an online education startup that has an entire program to educate self-driving engineers. \nFunding Unknown seed round from Khosla Ventures, Initialized Capital, and Charles River Ventures among others. Instrumental wants to prevent the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco from ever happening again. Instrumental cofounders Sam Weiss and Anna Shedletsky. Picture: Instrumental \nWhat it is: A startup that tracks assembly line production and uses machine learning technology to spot defective units early. \nFounded by two former Apple engineers, Instrumental hopes to make it a lot easier to catch manufacturing problems before they start costing companies big money. They have designed a box that takes pictures of every device as it's assembled so engineers working remotely can see what's happening along the line. \nBut the real key is in the company's software: Instrumental is using machine learning to be able to spot defective units even before humans can. \nFunding: $US10 million from Eclipse Ventures, First Round, and Root Ventures, among others. Misty Robotics wants to build a robot for everyone. Misty Robotics' mysterious website page. Picture: Misty Robotics \nWhat it is: A company that's working on home and office robots. \nMisty is a spin-off of Sphero, the company that built the Star Wars BB-8 droid and showed the world how fun a toy robot can be. Instead of toys, Misty is developing practical robots. \n'These robots will be seen and treated as our friends, our teammates, and a part of our families -- performing helpful tasks, providing safety, and interacting with humans in entertaining and friendly ways that have only been seen before in science fiction,' the company said at its launch . \nFunding: $US11.5 million from Venrock, Foundry Group, and others. Obsidian Security hopes to help protect enterprises' data. Obsidian cofounders Matt Wolff, Glenn Chisholm, and Ben Johnson. Picture: Obsidian Security \nWhat it is: A security startup that's focused on making enterprise customers' data more secure. \nObsidian excited investors by assembling an all-star team of security experts from Cylance and Carbon Black. The team is specifically trying to help protect hybrid computing systems, which join companies' internal data centres to cloud services on the internet. And it's planning to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to help customise its security solutions for individual customers. \nFunding: $US9.5 million from Greylock. Clark wants to turn people into tutors. The Clark team. Picture: Clark/Facebook \nWhat it is: An education startup that's helping teachers build and grow tutoring businesses. \nClark's developed a smart assistant that helps tutors manage their businesses. Its app was getting buzz even before it was featured on Apple's new show, 'Planet of the Apps.' But the mention on the show helped the company secure a $US2 million check from Snapchat's original investors. \nFunding: $US3.5 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Human Ventures, and Winklevoss Capital among others. VoiceOps wants to make sales calls smarter through AI. VoiceOps founders Nate Becker, Daria Evdokimova, and Ethan Barhydt. Picture: VoiceOps \nWhat it is: A startup whose software can analyse sales calls. \nVoiceOps wants to listen to your sales team's calls and help your team figure out how to improve. The company focuses on analysing large numbers of calls to see what's working and what isn't. That makes it distinct from its well-funded challenger, Chorus.Ai, which analyses individual calls. \nFunding: $US1.975 million from Accel, Y Combinator, Founder's Fund, and Lowercase Capital, according to TechCrunch NOW WATCH: Tech Insider videos Business Insider Emails & Alerts \nSite highlights each day to your inbox.

      "text": "Wednesday 30 August 2017 06.00 BST Last modified on Thursday 31 August 2017 13.37 BST \nF or the briefest moment in March 2014, Facebook’s dominance looked under threat. Ello, amid much hype , presented itself as the non-corporate alternative to Facebook. According to the manifesto accompanying its public launch, Ello would never sell your data to third parties, rely on advertising to fund its service, or require you to use your real name. Whole Foods price cuts are at center of Amazon-Walmart online war Read more \nThe hype fizzled out as Facebook continued to expand. Yet Ello’s rapid rise and fall is symptomatic of our contemporary digital world and the monopoly-style power accruing to the 21st century’s new “platform” companies, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Their business model lets them siphon off revenues and data at an incredible pace, and consolidate themselves as the new masters of the economy. Monday brought another giant leap as Amazon raised the prospect of an international grocery price war by slashing prices on its first day in charge of the organic retailer Whole Foods. \nThe platform – an infrastructure that connects two or more groups and enables them to interact – is crucial to these companies’ power. None of them focuses on making things in the way that traditional companies once did. Instead, Facebook connects users, advertisers, and developers; Uber, riders and drivers; Amazon, buyers and sellers. \nReaching a critical mass of users is what makes these businesses successful: the more users, the more useful to users – and the more entrenched – they become. Ello’s rapid downfall occurred because it never reached the critical mass of users required to prompt an exodus from Facebook – whose dominance means that even if you’re frustrated by its advertising and tracking of your data, it’s still likely to be your first choice because that’s where everyone is, and that’s the point of a social network. Likewise with Uber: it makes sense for riders and drivers to use the app that connects them with the biggest number of people, regardless of the sexism of Travis Kalanick , the former chief executive, or the ugly ways in which it controls drivers, or the failures of the company to report serious sexual assaults by its drivers. \nNetwork effects generate momentum that not only helps these platforms survive controversy, but makes it incredibly difficult for insurgents to replace them. \nAs a result, we have witnessed the rise of increasingly formidable platform monopolies. Google, Facebook and Amazon are the most important in the west. (China has its own tech ecosystem.) Google controls search, Facebook rules social media, and Amazon leads in e-commerce. And they are now exerting their power over non-platform companies – a tension likely to be exacerbated in the coming decades. Look at the state of journalism: Google and Facebook rake in record ad revenues through sophisticated algorithms; newspapers and magazines see advertisers flee, mass layoffs, the shuttering of expensive investigative journalism, and the collapse of major print titles like the Independent . A similar phenomenon is happening in retail, with Amazon’s dominance undermining old department stores . \nThese companies’ power over our reliance on data adds a further twist. Data is quickly becoming the 21st-century version of oil – a resource essential to the entire global economy, and the focus of intense struggle to control it. Platforms, as spaces in which two or more groups interact, provide what is in effect an oil rig for data. Every interaction on a platform becomes another data point that can be captured and fed into an algorithm. In this sense, platforms are the only business model built for a data-centric economy. \nMore and more companies are coming to realise this. We often think of platforms as a tech-sector phenomenon, but the truth is that they are becoming ubiquitous across the economy. Uber is the most prominent example, turning the staid business of taxis into a trendy platform business. Siemens and GE, two powerhouses of the 20th century, are fighting it out to develop a cloud-based system for manufacturing . Monsanto and John Deere, two established agricultural companies, are trying to figure out how to incorporate platforms into farming and food production. ‘Google, ostensibly a search engine company, virtual reality [its Cardboard viewer is pictured right], and all sorts of other personal services.’ \nAnd this poses problems. At the heart of platform capitalism is a drive to extract more data in order to survive. One way is to get people to stay on your platform longer. Facebook is a master at using all sorts of behavioural techniques to foster addictions to its service: how many of us scroll absentmindedly through Facebook, barely aware of it? \nAnother way is to expand the apparatus of extraction. This helps to explain why Google, ostensibly a search engine company, is moving into the consumer internet of things ( Home / Nest ), self-driving cars ( Waymo ), virtual reality ( Daydream / Cardboard ), and all sorts of other personal services. Each of these is another rich source of data for the company, and another point of leverage over their competitors. \nOthers have simply bought up smaller companies: Facebook has swallowed Instagram ($1bn) , WhatsApp ($19bn) , and Oculus ($2bn) , while investing in drone-based internet, e-commerce and payment services. It has even developed a tool that warns when a start-up is becoming popular and a possible threat. Google itself is among the most prolific acquirers of new companies, at some stages purchasing a new venture every week . The picture that emerges is of increasingly sprawling empires designed to vacuum up as much data as possible. \nBut here we get to the real endgame: artificial intelligence (or, less glamorously, machine learning). Some enjoy speculating about wild futures involving a Terminator-style Skynet, but the more realistic challenges of AI are far closer. In the past few years, every major platform company has turned its focus to investing in this field. As the head of corporate development at Google recently said, “We’re definitely AI first.” Tinkering with minor regulations while AI companies amass power won’t do \nAll the dynamics of platforms are amplified once AI enters the equation: the insatiable appetite for data, and the winner-takes-all momentum of network effects. And there is a virtuous cycle here: more data means better machine learning, which means better services and more users, which means more data. Currently Google is using AI to improve its targeted advertising, and Amazon is using AI to improve its highly profitable cloud computing business. As one AI company takes a significant lead over competitors, these dynamics are likely to propel it to an increasingly powerful position. \nWhat’s the answer? We’ve only begun to grasp the problem, but in the past, natural monopolies like utilities and railways that enjoy huge economies of scale and serve the common good have been prime candidates for public ownership. The solution to our newfangled monopoly problem lies in this sort of age-old fix, updated for our digital age. It would mean taking back control over the internet and our digital infrastructure, instead of allowing them to be run in the pursuit of profit and power. Tinkering with minor regulations while AI firms amass power won’t do. If we don’t take over today’s platform monopolies, we risk letting them own and control the basic infrastructure of 21st-century society. \n• Nick Srnicek, a lecturer in digital economy at King’s College London, is the author of Platform Capitalism Topics",

      "text": "CRAIG VENTER, a biologist and boss of Human Longevity, a San Diego-based company that is building the world’s largest genomic database, is something of a rebel. In the late 1990s he declared that the international, publicly funded project to sequence the human genome was going about it the wrong way, and he developed a cheaper and quicker method of his own. His latest ruffling of feathers comes from work that predicts what a person will look like from their genetic data.\nHuman Longevity has assembled 45,000 genomes, mostly from patients who have been in clinical trials, and data on their associated physical attributes. The company uses machine-learning tools to analyse these data and then make predictions about how genetic sequences are tied to physical features. These efforts have improved to the point where the company is able to generate photo-like pictures of people without ever clapping eyes on them.\n  6   a day ago Retail   In a paper this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Dr Venter and his colleagues describe the process, which they call “phenotype-based genomic identification”. The group took an ethnically diverse group of 1,061 people of different ages and sequenced their genomes. They also took high-resolution, three-dimensional images of their faces, and measured their eye and skin colour, age, height and weight. This information was used as a “training set” to develop an algorithm capable of working out what people would look like on the basis of their genes.\nApplying this algorithm to unknown genomes, the team was able to generate images that could be matched to real photographs for eight out of ten people. (This fell to a less impressive five out of ten when the test was restricted to those of a single race, which narrows facial differences.) About a year ago, using the same algorithm, the company produced a prediction of what your correspondent looked like at the age of 20 from her genome. The result can be compared below with a photograph of her at that age. Readers can judge for themselves if it is a reasonable likeness.\nCritics immediately took to social media to dispute the findings. Jason Piper, a former employee of Human Longevity, argued that “because everyone looks close to the average of their race, everyone looks like their prediction”. One thing in Dr Venter’s favour, however, is that the findings are based on a relatively small group of people. With machine-learning techniques, the larger the set of data the better the results; working with tens of thousands of genomes could well improve the prediction rate.\nCreating pictures of people’s faces from their genomes has a number of potential uses, especially in forensic science. It might be possible to reconstruct the face of a perpetrator from any genetic material they have left behind, such as blood or body fluids. That would allow police to “see” the face of suspects in cases of murder, assault and rape. It could also help with identifying unrecognisable victims who have been burned or maimed. Unsolved cases might be reopened if suitable samples were still available.\nAs Dr Venter is quick to point out, this technology has other implications, among them for privacy. He considers that genomic information must now be treated as personal information, even if it is presented as an anonymised sequence of letters—as is currently the case in some countries. It will, he warns, be possible to construct a face from the limited genetic data that people currently post online, for example, from DNA-testing services such as 23andMe.\nThis in turn raises the possibility that people may no longer be willing to have their genetic information included in public sequencing efforts, even though such work can help combat diseases. If facial projections can be made from genomes, then someone’s appearance could subsequently be matched to real online photographs. This might mean that people’s genetic sequences, and all their flaws, could be connected to their identity in public.\nThe connection between genes and faces can work both ways. Just as genomes can be used to build up a picture of faces, so facial features are able to reveal genetic diseases. It is reckoned that 30-40% of genetic diseases cause changes to the shape of the face or skull, allowing, in some cases, experienced doctors to diagnose a condition simply by looking at a patient’s face. So why not train an app to do that?\nFace healer\nCompanies already are. Face2Gene is a smartphone app developed by FDNA, a startup based in Boston co-founded by Moti Shniberg and Lior Wolf. Mr Shniberg’s previous venture was bought by Facebook to develop the photo-tagging feature that identifies people in pictures uploaded to the social-media site. The FDNA app allows a doctor to snap a picture of a patient, upload it to the internet (along with the patient’s height, weight and clinical data) and let the firm’s algorithm produce a list of possible diseases from its online database. The app can access information on 10,000 diseases; facial recognition works for 2,500 of them, so far.\nEach diagnosis comes with a probability score that reflects the chances of the app being correct. It also lists any genetic mutations known to cause the disease, which can help with an analysis of a patient’s condition. Dekel Gelbman, FDNA’s chief executive, estimates that the app is being used by doctors and researchers in 130 countries. The patients’ data are stored securely, anonymised and encrypted.\nAs with Dr Venter’s work, the deeper the pool of data available to facial researchers, the more valuable it becomes. Christoffer Nellaker of the University of Oxford has set up a website called “Minerva & Me”, where both the healthy and those with diseases can upload pictures of themselves and provide consent for their images to be used for studies. He is also setting up a network, the Minerva Consortium, to encourage artificial-intelligence researchers to share their data.\nMaximilian Muenke of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland and Marius Linguraru of the Children’s National Health System in Washington, DC, and their colleagues are trying to broaden things out, too. They have published a series of studies using facial-recognition algorithms that were trained with photos of African, Asian and Latin American patients to identify different genetic diseases with accuracies of more than 90%. In many poor countries, expensive antenatal tests to identify genetic diseases are not available. A baby with Down’s syndrome, for example, is usually identified before birth in Europe and America, but in poor countries many are not diagnosed before they are a year old. The researchers intend to produce an app that will help doctors to identify dozens of the most common syndromes using a smartphone.\nDig deeper Leader: What machines can tell from your face Science and technology: Advances in AI are used to spot signs of sexuality Business: Ever better and cheaper, face-recognition technology is spreading \n  \"Making faces\"",

      "text": "When it comes to treating cancer, surgeons want to get rid of as much cancerous tissue as possible during tumor removal. Now a new technology—the size of a pen—is attempting to make that easier by distinguishing between tumors and healthy tissue in just 10 seconds. \nThe MasSpec Pen is a real-time diagnostic tool created by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin. In a new study published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine , the researchers report that their handheld device (which is not yet FDA-approved) uses tiny droplets of water to analyze human tissue samples for cancer with 96% accuracy. \n“It’s a gentle, simple chemical process,” says study author Livia Schiavinato Eberlin , an assistant professor of chemistry at UT Austin. “It’s highly specific and highly sensitive. The fact that it’s non-destructive brings a new approach to cancer diagnosis.” \nMORE: Researchers Find a Way to Light Up Cancer Cells \nGetting rid of all cancerous tissue while also preventing any harm to healthy tissue is a delicate process. When operating on a woman with breast cancer, for example, a doctor needs to remove the tumor and other affected tissues while maintaining the rest of the breast. Currently there are other tools available to surgeons for tissue diagnosis, but many use gases or solvents that can be harmful for the human body. In 2016, researchers in Massachusetts reported that they developed a probe that can find and light up cancer cells, making them easier for surgeons to see. But other methods currently available to surgeons today are slower than the MasSpec Pen, the study authors say, in some cases by 30 minutes or more. \nHuman cells produce a variety of small molecules, and cancer creates a unique set of them that can be used for pattern identification. The MasSpec Pen produces a small drop of water that extracts molecules from a person’s cells during surgery. Through machine learning, the MasSpec Pen is able to determine what molecular fingerprint is normal and what is cancer, Eberlin says. \nIn the study, the researchers tested 253 human tissue samples from lung, ovary, thyroid and breast cancer tumors and compared them to samples of healthy tissues. The device was 96% accurate at identifying cancerous tissues. The researchers also tested the MasSpec Pen in live mice with tumors and found that the device was able to identify the presence of cancer without harming healthy surrounding tissues. The device can also identify different subtypes of lung and thyroid cancer, and the team hopes to make it more specified for other types of cancer, too. \nTIME Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample \nThe researchers say they need to continue validating their work and that they plan to start clinical testing in humans in 2018. Until then, it’s unclear how exactly the device will work when integrated into surgery. While the pen-sized device that the surgeon would use is small, the device is connected to a large mass spectrometer, which helps the process of analyzing individual molecules . That large machine would need to be wheeled in and out of a surgery room for each procedure. The pen is disposable, so surgeons would replace it with each surgery. \n“This is a good example of a tool that empowers our transition to precision medicine where the treatment can be done with much higher levels of confidence,” says study author Thomas Milner , professor of biomedical engineering in UT Austin’s Cockrell School of Engineering . “Treatment can be planned and given where the outcomes are known. This is one tool along that path.” ",

      "text": "Facebook said Wednesday it has uncovered approximately $100,000 in fraudulent ad spending across its network tied to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\n\"In reviewing the ads buys, we have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 — associated with roughly 3,000 ads — that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies,\" Alex Stamos, Chief Security Officer at Facebook wrote in a post . \"Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\"\nAdditionally, Facebook said it found approximately $50,000 in \"potentially politically related ad spending,\" was spent on approximately 2,200 ads.\nMAYWEATHER VS MCGREGOR: 2.9 MILLION VIEWERS WATCHED FIGHT ON PIRATED STREAMS, SAYS SECURITY FIRM\nThese \"potentially politcally-related ads\" were bought from accounts with U.S. IP addresses, but the language was set to Russian, Facebook noted. Facebook noted the ads did not necessarily violate any policy or law.\nStamos added that the vast majority of the ads did not specifically reference the U.S. presidential election, but rather focused on \"divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\"\nIn April, Facebook released a white paper about operatives trying to deliver or amplify divivisive messages utilizing Facebook ads.\nEric Feinberg, a founding partner of deep web analysis company GIPEC, told Fox News that he was not surprised by Facebook’s discovery. “A lot of the nefarious activity, including the spread of pirated sports content, is being posted by Facebook profiles that do not have the normal characteristics of a legitimate Facebook profile, which means that they are bots,\" Feinberg said over the phone.\nFacebook is working to improve its technology to detect fake accounts, while working to reduce fake news being spread across its platform, which has over 1 billion monthly active users around the world.\nFACEBOOK SECRETLY RELEASES PHOTO-SHARING APP IN CHINA\nIn the past few months, Stamos wrote that fake accounts in France, Germany and other countries saw action taken against them. The company has also stopped allowing Pages that \"repeatedly share false news to advertise on Facebook.\"\nWhile some of Facebook's initiatives have helped to stem the rise of fake news on its platform, the social networking giant still has more to do.\nThe company is utilizing machine learning to help limit spam and reduce low-quality web pages its users see, while also adopting new ways to fight against pages that try to disguise the real content or the true destination of an ad or post.\nThe Mark Zuckerberg-led company has also worked to reduce spammers' influence and reduce the number of stories from sources \"that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate information.\"\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia .

      "text": "IBM and MIT came together today to sign a 10-year, $240 million partnership agreement that establishes the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab at the prestigious Cambridge, MA academic institution.\nThe lab will be co-chaired by Dario Gil, IBM Research VP of AI and Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering.\nBig Blue intends to invest $240 million into the lab where IBM researchers and MIT students and faculty will work side by side to conduct advanced AI research. As to what happens to the IP that the partnership produces, the sides were a bit murky about that.\nThis much we know: MIT plans to publish papers related to the research, while the two parties plan to open source a good part of the code. Some of the IP will end up inside IBM products and services. MIT hopes to generate some AI-based startups as part of the deal too.\n“The core mission of joint lab is to bring together MIT scientists and IBM [researchers] to shape the future of AI and push the frontiers of science,” IBM’s Gil told TechCrunch.\nTo that end, the two parties plan to put out requests to IBM scientists and the MIT student community to submit ideas for joint research. To narrow the focus of what could be a broad endeavor, they have established a number of principles to guide the research.\nThis includes developing AI algorithms with goal of getting beyond specific applications for neural-based deep learning networks and finding more generalized ways to solve complex problems in the enterprise.\nSecondly, they hope to harness the power of machine learning with quantum computing, an area that IBM is working hard to develop right now. There is tremendous potential for AI to drive the development of quantum computing and conversely for quantum computing and the computing power it brings to drive the development of AI.\nWith IBM’s Watson Security and Healthcare divisions located right down the street from MIT in Kendall Square, the two parties have agreed to concentrate on these two industry verticals in their work. Finally, the two teams plan to work together to help understand the social and economic impact of AI in society, which as we have seen has already proven to be considerable.\nWhile this is a big deal for both MIT and IBM, Chandrakasan made clear that the lab is but one piece of a broader campus-wide AI initiative. Still, the two sides hope the new partnership will eventually yield a number of research and commercial breakthroughs that will lead to new businesses both inside IBM and in the Massachusetts startup community, particularly in the healthcare and cybersecurity areas.\nFeatured Image: Photo: Rick Friedman/Corbis/Getty Images/Getty ",

      "text": "A rendering of the new Facebook offices at 100 Binney St. By Janelle Nanos Globe Staff August 30, 2017 \nFacebook has a status update: The social network will open a new office in Cambridge next year and plans to hire more than 500 employees, bringing the staff to 650. \nThe company, which founder Mark Zuckerberg launched at Harvard University before decamping for the West Coast, established its first Boston-area team nearly four years ago, with a small group of employees sharing a workspace. Today, that team has grown to more than 100 people in a Kendall Square office, and space is getting tight, said Ryan Mack, who leads the Facebook Boston office. Advertisement \n“We serve 2 billion people on Facebook,” he said, “and we need to continue to scale.” \nThe new offices will occupy the top three floors of 100 Binney St., a new building designed by Elkus Manfredi that is scheduled to open early next year. Facebook will share the space with 300 Bristol-Myers Squibb employees. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Sign up for more newsletters here \n“This makes them one of the largest employers in Cambridge,” said Cambridge City Councilor Nadeem Mazen. “It’s a confirmation of something we know and celebrate” about the region’s technological prowess. \nMack said the new space will allow the Cambridge-based team to ramp up efforts on several fronts. \nThe office will be a hub for the company’s machine-learning efforts, as the company attempts to understand how Facebook’s data, hardware, and software can be optimized to serve users, he said. Advertisement \nThat team has recently gotten new support from David Brooks, a computer science professor at Harvard who will be collaborating with Facebook while on sabbatical this year. Brooks has been studying how computer hardware systems are physically designed to operate and interact with software, focusing on attributes such as how battery life and temperature of devices affect how well they function. \nThe new office also will host a “Connectivity Lab” focused on delivering technology and Internet access to the 4 billion people worldwide who currently live without the Internet. The team in Boston will be working to develop new technology and partnerships to build more efficient networks with telecom companies, Mack said, and will partner with hardware manufacturers to develop products. \nThe news comes amid recent reports that Facebook is experimenting with hardware again after a failed attempt to create its own phone in 2013. According to a patent application filed last month, Facebook is looking to develop a gadget that operates a bit like a Lego set. The modular electromechanical device has various pieces that can be assembled and might include a speaker, GPS, microphone, touch display, and phone. There has also been speculation that Facebook is working to design interactive in-home speakers like those recently launched by Google and Amazon. \nMack said he could not specify what projects are in the pipeline in Boston but said that, overall, the new office will continue to focus on mobile and data center support for Facebook’s 2 billion users. \nMazen said he hopes Facebook’s expansion will bring job-training initiatives and other educational efforts to the neighborhood. It’s one thing to connect billions of people, Mazen said, and another to “connect the people literally living in the shadow of Kendall Square.” \n“I hope they show the leadership and commitment to do it,” he said.

      "title": "Uber's self-driving cars hit Toronto streets today — in manual mode",
      "text": "Uber put a pair of self-driving cars on Toronto streets Tuesday after winning approval from the province for on-road testing of its autonomous vehicle technology. Two autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating in manual mode will be driving around the University of Toronto campus and surrounding areas starting Tuesday and continuing for the rest of the week. “Manual mode” means that although the cars have self-driving capability, they will be operated by human drivers. \nThe cars aren’t available for rides: they will be conducting mapping tasks. Uber says it hopes to test the cars in autonomous mode by the end of 2017.\nRead more: Uber opening Toronto research hub for driverless car technology \nUber self-driving car crash comes amid fierce debate on regulations \n  “This data will support our engineering efforts as we prepare for official testing later this year,” says Susie Heath, a spokesperson for Uber Canada. \nUber announced in May that it would open a research group devoted to driverless car technology in Toronto, creating a third hub and its first outside the U.S. for the company’s AV ambitions.\nLast year, Ontario became the first province in Canada to allow on-road testing of AVs. The Ministry of Transportation’s pilot program permits approved companies and research groups to test their vehicles providing that applicants follow certain criteria, including keeping a human in the driver’s seat to monitor vehicle operations at all times. \nUber's new Advanced Technologies Group in Toronto will be led by Raquel Urtasun, a University of Toronto computer science professor and Canada Research Chair in machine learning and computer vision. ( Erica Edwards ) A spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of Transportation says that seven groups have been approved for on-road testing under the pilot program: Uber, the University of Waterloo, the Erwin Hymer Group, QNX, Continental, X-matik Inc., and Magna. Uber’s two AVs join a fleet of conventional sensor-equipped cars that began collecting mapping data from Toronto’s streets last September. \nUber’s self-driving car tests elsewhere have been accompanied by regulatory disputes. In California, Uber initially refused to apply for permits for the self-driving cars it was operating in San Francisco, arguing that the vehicles don’t meet the state’s definition of autonomous. The New York Times also reported that Uber’s AVs in San Francisco ran several red lights. \nThe state revoked the vehicles’ registrations, and Uber responded by moving its testing to Arizona, where regulations are more permissive. (An Uber AV in Arizona was involved in a crash, but police said the other driver was at fault.) Uber later obtained the California permits and put its self-driving cars back on the streets. \nThe cars in San Francisco are also involved in testing and development, not picking up passengers. In Pittsburgh, where Uber’s biggest AV research hub is located, self-driving cars have been picking up passengers — with a safety driver in the front seat — since September 2016.\nThe company has had a tumultuous year. A former engineer alleged that she had been sexually harassed at work, prompting an investigation into Uber’s workplace culture. Waymo, Google’s self-driving unit, is suing Uber , claiming that a former engineer stole thousands of files on a critical piece of hardware before founding a company that was acquired by Uber (Uber later fired him ). Dogged by controversies and grappling with his mother’s death in a boating accident, CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down in June and has not yet been replaced.\nOntario has said it wants to position itself at the forefront of the emerging autonomous vehicle market, which some — including Uber — believe will be worth billions of dollars. The province also cites the potential for more environmentally-friendly and safer roads, since automated drivers are not prone to distraction or drinking and driving, like humans are.",

      "text": "AI that can determine a person’s sexuality from photos shows the dark side of the data age Posted Advertisement We count on machine learning systems for everything from creating playlists to driving cars, but like any tool, they can be bent toward dangerous and unethical purposes, as well. Today’s illustration of this fact is a new paper from Stanford researchers, who have created a machine learning system that they claim can tell from a few pictures whether a person is gay or straight. The research is as surprising as it is disconcerting. In addition to exposing an already vulnerable population to a new form of systematized abuse, it strikes directly at the egalitarian notion that we can’t (and shouldn’t) judge a person by their appearance, nor guess at something as private as sexual orientation from something as simple as a snapshot or two. But the accuracy of the system reported in the paper seems to leave no room for mistake: this is not only possible, it has been achieved. \nIt relies on cues apparently more subtle than most can perceive — cues many would suggest do not exist. And it demonstrates, as it is intended to, a class of threat to privacy that is entirely unique to the imminent era of ubiquitous computer vision. \nBefore discussing the system itself, it should be made clear that this research was by all indications done with good intentions. In an extensive set of authors’ notes that anyone commenting on the topic ought to read, Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang address a variety of objections and questions. Most relevant are perhaps their remarks as to why the paper was released at all: \nWe were really disturbed by these results and spent much time considering whether they should be made public at all. We did not want to enable the very risks that we are warning against. The ability to control when and to whom to reveal one’s sexual orientation is crucial not only for one’s well-being, but also for one’s safety. \nWe felt that there is an urgent need to make policymakers and LGBTQ communities aware of the risks that they are facing. We did not create a privacy-invading tool, but rather showed that basic and widely used methods pose serious privacy threats. \nCertainly this is only one of many systematized attempts to derive secret information such as sexuality, emotional state or medical conditions. But it is a particularly concerning one, for several reasons. Seeing what we can’t (or won’t) \nThe paper, due to be published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, details a rather ordinary supervised-learning approach to addressing the possibility of identifying people as gay or straight from their faces alone. (Note: the paper is still in draft form.) \nUsing a database of facial imagery (from a dating site that makes its data public), the researchers collected 35,326 images of 14,776 people, with (self-identified) gay and straight men and women all equally represented. Their facial features were extracted and quantified: everything from nose and eyebrow shape to facial hair and expression. \nA deep learning network crunched through all these features, finding which tended to be associated with individuals of a given sexual orientation. The researchers didn’t “seed” this with any preconceived notions of how gay or straight people look; the system merely correlated certain features with sexuality and identified patterns. Composite faces created from thousands of profile pictures, illustrating the slight differences observed by the system. \nThese patterns can be searched for in facial imagery to let the computer guess at the subject’s sexuality — and it turns out that the AI system is significantly better than humans at this task. \nWhen presented with multiple pictures of a pair of faces, one gay and one straight, the algorithm could determine which was which 91 percent of the time with men and 83 percent of the time with women. People provided the same images were correct 61 and 54 percent of the time, respectively — not much better than flipping a coin. \nThe variation between the four groups is described in a second paper; apart from obvious behavioral differences like one group grooming or doing make-up one way, the general trend was toward “feminine” features in gay men and “masculine” features in lesbians. This diagram shows where features were found that were predictive of sexual orientation. Related Articles WTF is AI? Embrace empathy Algorithmic accountability This accuracy, it must be noted, is only in the system’s ideal situation of choosing between two people, one of whom is known to be gay. When the system evaluated a group of 1,000 faces, only 7 percent of which belonged to gay people (in order to be more representative of the actual proportion of the population), it did relatively poorly. Only its top 10 showed a 90 percent hit rate.\nThere is also the very real possibility of bias in the data: for one thing, only young white Americans representing the binaries male/female and gay/straight were included. As the paper explains: \nDespite our attempts to obtain a more diverse sample, we were limited to studying white participants from the U.S. As the prejudice against gay people and the adoption of online dating websites is unevenly distributed across groups characterized by different ethnicities, we could not find sufficient numbers of non-white gay participants. \nAlthough the researchers suggest that other ethnicities and groups would likely see similar facial patterns and that the system would remain effective, that really is something that should be verified with evidence, not speculated on. \nIt is also arguable that the classifier was picking up on features specific to people on dating sites, or some sort of self-selection mechanic such as straight American men deliberately avoiding a look they consider associated with being gay. As GLAAD puts it, “it’s a description of beauty standards on dating sites that ignores huge segments of the LGBTQ community.” \nCertainly it is reasonable to doubt the real-world effectiveness of this system, since it has been trained on a very limited pool of data and is mainly effective on examples from that pool. Further study is warranted. However, it seems short-sighted to suggest that a working system like this is not possible. Facing the truth \nThe allegation that this technology is no better than “Phrenology 2.0,” a fraudulent linkage of unrelated physical features to complex internal processes, is understandable but not really true. \n“Physiognomy is now universally, and rightly, rejected as a mix of superstition and racism disguised as science,” the researchers write in the paper’s introduction (physiognomy judged based on facial features, while the more notorious phrenology focused on skull shape). But the pseudoscience was a failure because its practitioners worked backwards. They decided who evinced “criminality” or “sexual deviance” and then decided which features those people had in common. \nIt turns out people are just plain bad at this kind of task — we see too much of ourselves in people, and we act and perceive instinctively. But it doesn’t mean that visible features and physiology or psychology are unrelated. No one doubts that machines can pick up on things humans don’t have the capacity to perceive, from minute chemical traces of bombs or drugs to subtle patterns in MRI scans that indicate cancer precursors. \nThe paper suggests that the computer vision system is picking up on equally subtle patterns, both artificial and natural, but primarily the latter; the researchers were careful to focus on features that can’t be altered easily. It’s supportive of the hypothesis that sexuality is biologically determined, possibly by different fetal hormone exposure, which could then cause slight physiological differences in addition to affecting whom one is attracted to. The patterns observed by the system are similar to those predicted by the prenatal hormone theory. \nThis begins to verge on a larger social and philosophical debate regarding love, sexuality, determinism and the reduction of emotions and personalities to mere biological traits. But this isn’t really the time or place and honestly, I’m not really the guy. So I’m going to steer clear of that and veer toward the other major issue, which is that of privacy. Dangers and limitations \nThe implications of automatically determining a person’s sexuality from a handful of photos are enormous, first and most importantly because it puts LGBTQ people at risk worldwide in places where they remain an oppressed minority. The potential for abuse of a system like this is huge, and some may rightly disagree with the researchers’ decision to create and document it. \nBut it’s also arguable that it’s better to have the possibility out in the open in order to either implement countermeasures or otherwise allow people to prepare themselves for it. After all, it’s also possible to determine sexuality and many other private traits by analyzing Facebook or Twitter feeds. \nThe difference there is that you can obfuscate or control the information you put online; you can’t control who sees your face. It’s a surveillance society we live in, and increasingly a surveillant one , as well. \n“Even the best laws and technologies aimed at protecting privacy are, in our view, doomed to fail,” write the researchers. “The digital environment is very difficult to police; data can be easily moved across borders, stolen, or recorded without users’ consent.” \nThe cat is out of the bag, in other words. And it’s probably better that it’s being shown by researchers sympathetic to the people most affected than by the FBI or some other party doing it for their own agenda. \nThis is an enormously complex issue in countless ways, but it’s also a fascinating demonstration of the power of artificial intelligence to do something relatively easily that we’re unable to do ourselves. The implications of the technology are, as always, mixed, but it’s interesting how this kind of research helps define and guide humanity. \nThe researchers’ assessment of how this will play out aren’t optimistic per se, but they are refreshingly realistic in an age when tech is expected to play the savior but is just likely to be the villain. \n“We believe that further erosion of privacy is inevitable, and the safety of gay and other minorities hinges not on the right to privacy but on the enforcement of human rights, and tolerance of societies and governments,” they write. “In order for the post-privacy world to be safer and hospitable, it must be inhabited by well-educated people who are radically intolerant of intolerance.” \nTech won’t save us from ourselves — we might have to save ourselves from tech.

      "text": "Government asks Google, Facebook, Microsoft, others to remove Blue Whale links \nGoogle ’s voice search is one of the growing features for the mobile app, and the company has now announced support for more Indian languages. Google is adding Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu this list. Overall, Google Voice Search will now support eight more Indian languages. \nThe language support feature will be part of the Gboard app on Android and the Google App as well. Native speakers of these languages will now be able to give voice queries in these, rather than relying on Hindi or English all the time. \nIn order to use one of the new languages, a user will have to go the settings in the Google Search app, and pick the language in Voice settings menu. On Gboard, users can choose the language in the Settings after installing the app on their phone. Once that is done, a user can just type on the microphone symbol and start speaking. Google is also rolling out Voice search support for Indian languages on its iOS app. \nGoogle says it worked with native language speakers in order to collect the speech samples. This process helped train Google’s machine learning models to understand the sounds and words of the new languages. The company says relying on actual sample also improved the accuracy of the search. It adds that voice search will get better with time, once more users take to it and the machine learning systems will consequently learn more. \nWith mobile driving search across the world, Voice Search is one aspect which will continue to grow. Speakers from Google, Amazon, even Apple all rely on Voice Search, and Google has been at the forefront of pushing this. \nVoice search being extended to other Indian languages is not surprisingly at all, given how Android dominates the Indian smartphone. Google expects the next wave of users coming online in India will be mostly native language speakers, rather than English speakers. Thus it needs to make sure that its core products are ready for these users.   © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Related News",

      "text": "AI Programs Are Learning to Exclude Some African-American Voices Voice interfaces, chatbots, and other systems are discriminating against certain minority dialects. by Will Knight August 16, 2017 \nAll too often people make snap judgments based on how you speak. Some AI systems are also learning to be prejudiced against some dialects. And as language-based AI systems become ever more common, some minorities may automatically be discriminated against by machines, warn researchers studying the issue. \nAnyone with a strong or unusual accent may know what it’s like to have trouble being understood by Siri or Alexa. This is because voice-recognition systems use natural-language technology to parse the contents of speech, and it often relies on algorithms that have been trained with example data. If there aren’t enough examples of a particular accent or vernacular, then these systems may simply fail to understand you (see “ AI’s Language Problem ”). \nThe problem may be more widespread and pernicious than most people realize. Natural-language technology now powers automated interactions with customers, through automated phone systems or chatbots. It’s used to mine public opinion on the Web and social networks, and to comb through written documents for useful information. This means that services and products built on top of language systems may already be unfairly discriminating against certain groups.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences \nBrendan O’Connor , an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and one of his graduate students, Su Lin Blodgett , looked at the use of language on Twitter. Using demographic filtering, the researchers collected 59.2 million tweets with a high probability of containing African-American slang or vernacular. They then tested several natural-language processing tools on this data set to see how they would treat these statements. They found that one popular tool classified these posts as Danish with a high level of confidence. \n“If you analyze Twitter for people’s opinions on a politician and you’re not even considering what African-Americans are saying or young adults are saying, that seems problematic,” O’Connor says. \nThe pair also tested several popular machine-learning-based APIs that analyze text for meaning and sentiment, and they found that these systems struggled, too. “If you purchase a sentiment analyzer from some company, you don’t even know what biases it has in it,” O’Connor says. “We don’t have a lot of auditing or knowledge about these things.” \nHe says the problem extends to any system that uses language, including search engines. \nThe issue of unfairness emerging from the use of AI algorithms is gaining attention in some quarters as these algorithms are used more widely. One controversial example of possible bias is a proprietary algorithm called Compass, which is used to decide whether prison inmates should be granted parole. The workings of the algorithm are unknown, but research suggests it is biased against black inmates. Recommended for You ",

      "title": "WireX DDoS Botnet: An Army of Thousands of Hacked Android SmartPhones",
      "text": "Monday, August 28, 2017 Mohit Kumar Do you believe that just because you have downloaded an app from the official app store, you're safe from malware? Think twice before believing it. A team of security researchers from several security firms have uncovered a new, widespread botnet that consists of tens of thousands of hacked Android smartphones. Dubbed WireX, detected as \"Android Clicker,\" the botnet network primarily includes infected Android devices running one of the hundreds of malicious apps installed from Google Play Store and is designed to conduct massive application layer DDoS attacks. Researchers from different Internet technology and security companies—which includes Akamai, CloudFlare , Flashpoint, Google, Oracle Dyn, RiskIQ, Team Cymru—spotted a series of cyber attacks earlier this month, and they collaborated to combat it. Although Android malware campaigns are quite common these days and this newly discovered campaign is also not that much sophisticated, I am quite impressed with the way multiple security firms—where half of them are competitors—came together and shared information to take down a botnet. WireX botnet was used to launch minor DDoS attacks earlier this month, but after mid-August, the attacks began to escalate. The \"WireX\" botnet had already infected over 120,000 Android smartphones at its peak earlier this month, and on 17th August, researchers noticed a massive DDoS attack (primarily HTTP GET requests) originated from more than 70,000 infected mobile devices from over 100 countries. If your website has been DDoSed, look for the following pattern of User-Agent strings to check if it was WireX botnet: After further investigation, security researchers identified more than 300 malicious apps on Google’s official Play Store, many of which purported to be media, video players, ringtones, or tools for storage managers and app stores, which include the malicious WireX code. Just like many malicious apps, WireX apps do not act maliciously immediately after the installation in order to evade detection and make their ways to Google Play Store. Instead, WireX apps wait patiently for commands from its command and control servers located at multiple subdomains of \"axclick.store.\" Google has identified and already blocked most of 300 WireX apps, which were mostly downloaded by users in Russia, China, and other Asian countries, although the WireX botnet is still active on a small scale. If your device is running a newer version of the Android operating system that includes Google's Play Protect feature, the company will automatically remove WireX apps from your device, if you have one installed. Play Protect is Google's newly launched security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to remove (uninstall) malicious apps from users Android smartphones to prevent further harm. Also, it is highly recommended to install apps from reputed and verified developers, even when downloading from Google official Play Store and avoid installing unnecessary apps. Additionally, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your mobile device that can detect and block malicious apps before they can infect your device, and always keep your device and apps up-to-date. Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before attack vectors and capabilities with every passing day. Just at the beginning of this week, Google removed over 500 Android apps utilising the rogue SDK—that secretly distribute spyware to users—from its Play Store marketplace. Last month, we also saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store. A few days after that, researchers discovered another malicious Android SDK ads library , dubbed \"Xavier,\" found installed on more than 800 different apps that had been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store.

      "text": "MUMBAI: Infosys shares touched a three-year low on Friday after chief executive Vishal Sikka blamed the “continuous drumbeat” of distractions for his exit, underscoring investor concerns over the unfinished agenda of steering the IT bellwether away from its cost-driven delivery model. \n\nStocks at the Bengaluru-based software icon, among the first from India to list overseas, slipped as much as 13% before finally closing at Rs 923.10 apiece on the BSE . Infosys lost more than Rs 22,000 crore in market capitalisation after the fourth CEO exit in the past 10 years put the spotlight on inherent difficulty in transforming the 1980s’ company, built largely around wage-costs arbitrage. \n\nResponses from analysts and corporate-governance watchers were mixed. Some called it a setback to the company’s transformation initiatives, while others viewed the development as an end to the boardroom battle. \n\n“This is a severe dent to brand reputation, client conversation, investor confidence, employee morale and business transformation, which would affect its financial performance in short-to-medium term,” Rahul Jain and Ruchir Burde, analysts with Emkay, said in a report that downgraded Infosys to ‘reduce’ from ‘hold.’ \n\nAlso read: Separation blues: Vishal Sikka updates Twitter bio, posts e-mail on personal blog \n\nLingering uncertainty and lack of positive triggers in the foreseeable future would weigh on the valuations, Emkay said. “Clients… would prefer more certain business partners that provide continuity of thought. We believe this event may benefit competitors such as TCS or Cognizant — at least in short term.” \n\nBOARDROOM BATTLE \nHowever, there were others that didn’t seem rattled by the exit. Sarabjit Kour Nangra of Angel Broking retained a ‘buy’ rating, citing Infosys board’s resilience. Similarly, a section of Infosys investors interpreted Sikka’s resignation as end to the boardroom battle. \n\n“Sikka’s exit draws a longdrawn-out boardroom battle to a close. While the company did better than industry during Sikka’s tenure, it was nowhere near achieving Sikka’s own $20 billion target by 2020,” said VK Sharma, Head of Business, Private Client Group at HDFC Securities. “Sikka’s allegation that he was continuously being distracted does not wash as he had a long enough honeymoon period to make his mark.” \n\nMost market-watchers are, however, concerned about Sikka’s unfinished transformation agenda, which had sought to steer the company away from commoditized services toward automation, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Indian companies are competing with larger and more nimble-footed global rivals such as IBM and Accenture for a bigger share of the technology business. \n\nUNFINISHED AGENDA \n“This development has taken uncertainty on the stock to a different level. Earlier, we had a semblance of financial performance, which was credited to Sikka. Now, there is more uncertainty on the fundamentals while the whole governance saga continues,\" said Pramod Gubbi, head of equities at Ambit Capital. Ambit put the Infosys stock ‘under review’ from ‘buy’ on Monday, citing Infosys' refusal to make the Panaya report public. \n\n\"The continuous misalignment of views among the founders, the board and the MD has led to this resignation. It was imminent. I expect changes to the board. This uncertainty is not good for the shareholders,\" said Shriram Subramanian, MD, InGovern Research Services— a firm advising institutional investors on corporate governance standards. \n\nIn his exit note, Sikka said continuous distractions and disruptions had emerged as the key impediment in the management's efforts at transforming the company, hinting at the recent spat founders had with the board over many issues, including ex-CFO Rajiv Bansal's severance compensation and disclosures regarding probe into the Panaya acquisition. \n\n“Vishal Sikka’s resignation cannot come as a surprise. Despite best efforts, Infosys’ board was unable to protect him from the constant onslaught of Infosys’ highly-statured, yet petulant, critics,” said Institutional Investor Advisory Services India in a report. \n\n“He (Murthy) may find solace in Sikka’s resignation, but shareholders have paid the price — his comments have been a constant distraction, periodically destabilising the company.”",

      "text": "Comments Shares \nWe've seen plenty of mining-centric hardware of late, fueling the cryptocurrency craze. Biostar has its TB250-BTC Pro with 12 PCIe slots (11 x1 and one x16), and the ASRock H110 Pro BTC+ gets the plus-one treatment with 13 PCIe slots. Asus is looking to leave both solutions in its wake with its upcoming B2560 Mining Expert, a board with 18 PCIe x1 slots plus a physical x16 slot. With the ability to theoretically support 19 graphics cards, though note that current AMD and Nvidia drivers only support up to eight GPUs in a system, there's a problem in providing sufficient power, and Asus tackles that hurdle by including three 24-pin ATX connectors on the board. \nThe primary 24-pin connector serves up power for the main aspects of the board, including the chipset and USB ports, and the additional two connectors help supply all the extra PCIe slots with power. There are also three 4-pin Molex connectors in the vicinity of the PCIe x1 apartment complex for good measure. The design makes it simple to connect three PSUs without resorting to potentially hazardous PSU jumpers—all three power supplies come online with a single press of the power button. Strangely however, considering the mining focus, there's no on-board power or reset buttons, which would be a good addition for this sort of product. \nIn case it's not abundantly clear, the purpose of a motherboard like this is to help reduce the cost of the various extras needed to build a mining PC. The graphics cards do the real work, but with most motherboards you're limited to six, perhaps seven PCIe slots at most. That means you need to add an extra CPU, motherboard, memory, and storage for every six or so GPUs. That adds to the financial investment, and you could save about $600 by consolidating three rigs into one. \nOf course figuring out how to best connect 19 cards to a single board is no small task. You'll want some extra-long PCIe riser cables (maybe 100cm?), a healthy dose of planning, and a dash of creativity. Bake for 30 minutes or until your mining rig has reached a fluffy golden texture. Clearly, GPU-based mining isn't set to disappear anytime soon, though there's still the question of long-term profitability. The good news is that this sort of motherboard could also be used for other GPU-compute purposes, including SETI@Home, Folding@Home, or even machine learning. Hail, Skynet! \nDemand for mainstream graphics cards remains high, with prices still well above MSRP. Mainstream GPUs, or at least GPUs that require at most a single 8-pin PEG connector, are the primary target, since most PSUs don't have enough PEG connectors to handle more than four cards with dual PEG power connectors. That's something else you'll have to consider when attempting to connect eight Nvidia and eight AMD GPUs to this motherboard. \nOf course, stuffing tons of GPUs into a PC doesn't change the bottom line. RX 570/580 and GTX 1060 are now trending toward $1.50 per day in profit, and GTX 1070 is around $2 per day—all are far less attractive than the $4-$5 per day of a couple months back. If this board had been available in May or June, demand would have been far greater. But then, we've probably not heard the last of GPU prices being affected by mining. \nUnofficially, the B250 Mining Expert will go on sale in the next few weeks, with a budget-friendly price south of $150.

      "text": "The world would have warmed throughout the 20th Century even without carbon dioxide emissions from the industrial revolution, according to a new study.\n“This suggests that even if there had been no industrial revolution and burning of fossil fuels, there would have still been some warming through the twentieth century – to at least 1980,” according to lead author Jennifer Marohasy.\nThe world was about as warm in 1980 as it was during the Middle Ages when the Vikings settled Greenland and “when men dressed in tunics and built grand cathedrals with tall spires,” Marohasy wrote in The Spectator Australia on Tuesday, summarizing her study’s results.\nClimate scientists Marohasy and John Abbot used a sophisticated artificial intelligence-like computer system to see what temperatures may have done since 1830 without human influence based on proxy climate records going back to 50 A.D.\nThe ANN system is a “form of machine learning: think big data and artificial intelligence,” which she says has been used to more accurately predict rainfall than models used by Australia’s meteorological agency, Marohasy wrote in a blog post.\n“The difference between output from the ANN models and the proxy records is at most 0.2 °C; this was the situation for the studies from Switzerland and New Zealand. So, we suggest that at most, the contribution of industrialization to warming over the twentieth century would be in the order of 0.2°C,” she wrote.\nTheir findings challenge the mainline conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which also found the Earth warmed about 1 degree Celsius since before the industrial revolution. The IPCC just attributes all that warming to humans.\nWhat’s interesting is Marohasy’s study, like most proxy data, shows temperatures declining after 1980. That’s in direct conflict with actual temperature observations, which show a continued rise in global average temperature through to 1998 before it leveled off for about 15 years.\nThis is called the “divergence problem,” Marohasy wrote. “Rather than address this issue, key climate scientists, have been known to graft instrumental temperature series onto the proxy record from 1980 to literally ‘hide the decline.’”\nMarohasy isn’t the first scientist to argue the so-called Medieval Warming Period was about as warm as the late 20th Century.\nA 2013 Swedish study suggested the planet was warmer in ancient Roman times and the Middle Ages than today based on radiocarbon data on where tree lined were in Scandinavia.\nThe study found “the pine tree line (and summer temperatures) was consistently higher than present, as it was also during the Roman and Medieval periods.”\nMarohasy recently made headlines when she and meteorologist Lance Pidgeon called out Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology for changing temperature readings in the Snow Mountains.\nGovernment meteorologists removed temperature readings below 13 degrees Fahrenheit as part of a “quality control” system to filter out temperatures dipping below that mark.\nBureau Chief Executive Andrew Johnson said the faulty reading was due to an equipment malfunction, rejecting the notion his agency was trying to manipulate temperature records.\nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter\n .",

      "text": "Language September 06, 2017 \nYou’ve probably heard the news: AI is going to take your job . Wait, no: It’s going to create a new job for you . AI is going to kill us all ! Wait, no it’s not . AI is already totally smarter than us at, like, all the smart things . But that probably doesn’t matter ? Neural networks. Machine learning. Deep learning. OMG. WTF. HELP. \nTake a deep breath. Let’s consider for a second what we talk about when we talk about AI. Because I’m not sure many of us really know—or, at the very least, we’re not talking/ arguing /worrying about the same things. \n“You are right to be confused,” says Harvard computer scientist Leslie Valiant , because the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning “are suddenly being used interchangeably in the popular press.” Even Trevor Darrell, a leading artificial-intelligence researcher at UC Berkeley who’s also part of a DARPA-funded project on (wait for it) “explainable AI” admits that “there is no precise distinction—they overlap greatly.” \nAfter surveying half a dozen leading experts, I was able to triangulate a reasonable answer as to what the hell these words actually mean: \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the general label for a field of study—specifically, the study of whatever might answer the question “What is required for a machine to exhibit intelligence?” \nIf that doesn’t sound very satisfying, the experts don’t disagree. “At this point, AI is an aspirational term reflecting a goal,” Darrell says. What he means is that “AI” isn’t, technically speaking, a thing. It’s not in your phone. It isn’t going to eat the world or do anything to your job. It’s not even an “it” at all: It’s just a suitcase word enclosing a foggy constellation of “things”—plural—that do have real definitions and edges to them. All the other stuff you hear about—machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, what have you—are much more precise names for the various scientific, mathematical, and engineering methods that people employ within the field of AI. \nBut what’s so terrible about using the phrase “artificial intelligence” to enclose all that confusing detail—especially for all us non-PhDs? The words “artificial” and “intelligent” sound soothingly commonsensical when put together. But in practice, the phrase has an uncanny almost-meaning that sucks adjacent ideas and images into its orbit and spaghettifies them. When Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the company is now “ AI-first ,” does that mean he’s “summoning the demon,” like Elon Musk calls AI ? Is he hinting at an automation-uber-alles rebooting of capitalism itself , with universal basic income as the fig leaf? Or is he just talking about incrementally improving the consumer-facing products and services we’re already familiar with—whose version of “artificial intelligence” falls somewhere between “be as smart as a puppy” and “some subset of a cockroach’s brain” ? \nThis may all seem like semantic hair-splitting. But George Orwell was on to something when he famously wrote that “the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.” Using the same science-fictional shorthand to describe anything from self-driving cars to slightly better ad targeting surely inhibits basic comprehension. But its potential for seeding both magical thinking and abject confusion about real economic, social, and political changes also seems bottomless. If the experts don’t really know what they talk about when they talk about AI, is it any wonder that you and I don’t, either? \nIt therefore might be worth our while to apply a bit more effort when referring to “AI”-ish subjects. At the very least, we might want to avoid the word “intelligence” when referring to software, because nobody really knows what it means. For example, Google’s Go-playing computer system was “smart” enough to beat the world’s best human players—but if you try to get it to generalize what it “learned” about Go to any other domain, you’ll find it’s dumber than a houseplant . Even Alan Turing, the genius who mathematically defined what a computer is, considered the question of defining intelligence too hard ; his eponymous Turing test dodges it, essentially saying “intelligence is as intelligence does.” \nSo what should we call “AI”, if not that? Orwell suggests that the cure for words that cloud our thinking is better words: simpler ones, crisper ones. Some commentators suggest merely using “software” ; personally, I think “automation” does the trick. Instead of priming our minds with visions of inchoate software-spirits possessed of strange powers and inscrutable intentions, being more conscious of the words we choose might allow us to more clearly grasp the technologies around us. \nYou can follow John on Twitter .

      "text": "The Digital Banking Executive Securing Your Money With Blockchain Amber Baldet is convincing JPMorgan Chase and other institutions that change is good. By @mattleising More stories by Matthew Leising Illustration: Sam Kerr \nIn 2014, when it became clear that advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence were reshaping finance, executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co. pulled together their best engineers and told them, “Figure this out.” Among them was Amber Baldet, then a 31-year-old vice president for technology. “I started in machine learning, but I kept putting my hand up to say, ‘I know about ­blockchain,’” she says. \nBlockchain—the novel combination of cryptography and distributed computing that gave life to bitcoin in 2009—holds great promise for industries such as banking that process immense amounts of data. Baldet, now a JPMorgan executive herself, helped organize the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), a group of businesses experimenting with ethereum , a more powerful blockchain than the one that supports bitcoin. The alliance, which also includes Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. , among others, is developing Quorum, a modified version of ­ethereum with enhanced protections for client privacy. \nBaldet’s enthusiasm for technology goes back to childhood. As a 13-year-old, she persuaded her parents to let her use a 9600-baud modem left behind by a deceased relative. The moment was life-changing. Baldet connected to university message boards, whose members “got me into playing MUDs, the first choose-your-own-­adventure-style computer games, and reading books like Gödel, Escher, Bach ,” she says. The students taught her to see the world as “a fascinating puzzle worth unraveling.” \nAdam Ludwin, chief executive officer of blockchain startup Chain , whose clients include Nasdaq, Citigroup, and Visa, first met Baldet on a conference call. Even over the phone, he was impressed. “She’s really sharp and interested in getting things built,” he says. Baldet stands out because she’s “comfortable in the bank world as well as the cypherpunk or crypto community, and she seems equally authentic for both,” he says. \nThe promise of blockchain is to integrate all users of a market into a shared database; this in turn cuts costs and improves efficiency. There are still plenty of challenges for Baldet to get through with Quorum, including ensuring a level of data privacy and performance that will satisfy JPMorgan’s needs, she says. But she doesn’t want the bank driving every EEA project. Her team of five is working ­diligently alongside the alliance’s other members, creating their own secure version of an open source coding project. “What I hope is that other groups will solve their problems with Quorum,” Baldet says. “Actual adoption of ­projects is what we need.” ( Corrects to remove IBM from list of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance members in the second paragraph. ) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "text": "OpenAI bot remains undefeated against world’s greatest Dota 2 players Posted Moneytis is like a travel fare aggregator, but for sending money abroad Last night, OpenAI’s Dota 2 bot beat the world’s most celebrated professional players in one-on-one battles, showing just how advanced these machine learning systems are getting. \nThe bot beat Danil “Dendi” Ishutin rather easily at The International, one of the biggest eSports events in the world, and remains undefeated against the world’s top Dota 2 players. \nElon Musk’s OpenAI trained the bot by simply copying the AI and letting the two play each other for weeks on end. \n“We’ve coached it to learn just from playing against itself,” said OpenAI researcher Jakub Pachoki . “So we didn’t hard-code in any strategy, we didn’t have it learn from human experts, just from the very beginning, it just keeps playing against a copy of itself. It starts from complete randomness and then it makes very small improvements, and eventually it’s just pro level.” \nTo be clear, a 1v1 battle in Dota 2 is far less complex than an actual professional battle, which includes two teams of five players completing a variety of tasks simultaneously to achieve victory. But OpenAI said that’s working on another bot that could play against and alongside humans in a larger 5v5 battle. \nNot shockingly, Elon Musk was watching along and had some thoughts of his own, calling unregulated AI vastly more dangerous than North Korea: OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess & Go. \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2017 If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. pic.twitter.com/2z0tiid0lc \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2017 Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too. \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2017 \nThis isn’t the first time Elon Musk has spoken up about the dangers of AI without regulation. He said that the process of setting up a government body to regulate AI should start in the immediate future, speaking at the International Space Station R&D conference a few weeks ago. \nMusk has also thrown shade at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Twitter, saying that Zuck’s understanding of AI is limited . \nSpeaking at TC Sessions: Robotics, Rodney Brooks, founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics, disagreed with Musk saying that, currently, there isn’t much to regulate. \nIf you’re going to have a regulation now, either it applies to something and changes something in the world, or it doesn’t apply to anything. If it doesn’t apply to anything, what the hell do you have the regulation for? Tell me, what behavior do you want to change, Elon? By the way, let’s talk about regulation on self-driving Teslas, because that’s a real issue. \nAt the same event, head of Amazon Robotics Tye Brady said the following : \nI’m not really a fan of regulation. I’m a fan of doing whatever the customer seeks. We have a mission in mind to do order fulfillment in the best way possible. So, yeah, I’m not a fan of regulation. \nObviously, some of the world’s greatest minds in the fields of robotics/AI/ML are at an impasse, but the maturation of AI waits for no man . 0",

      "text": "Comments Shares \nSomething very interesting happened in the world of Dota 2 this weekend, and it wasn't The International. (Although that was obviously pretty big too.) As reported by The Verge , a self-taught AI bot took on pro player Danil \"Dendi\" Ishutin of Natus Vincere—and won convincingly. \nThe bot was designed by OpenAI , a non-profit AI research company founded and funded by, among other people, Tesla and SpaceX guy Elon Musk, who shared his satisfaction with the outcome on Twitter. OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess & Go. August 12, 2017 \nAnd that's true, but only to a point. It turns out a few conditions heavily arranged the match in the bot's favor, meaning we don't have to worry about robots taking over competitive esports just yet. \nThe OpenAI game was played under a very specific set of rules: It was a 1v1 contest rather than 5v5, which dramatically reduces the complexity of the gameplay, and both the bot and Dendi played with the same hero, Shadow Fiend, who as this Verge analysis explains relies on \"accurate timing and placement of his magical attack ability\" to succeed—the type of precision that bots naturally excel at. In fact, that's the only type of game the bot is capable of playing. \nThe AI also had access to Dota's bot API, meaning that it would have access to information like the distance between characters, as well as hard-coded player \"techniques.\" So while a human player has to learn and judge distances on the fly and react accordingly, bots can execute the appropriate attacks exactly, every time. \nWhile that may appear to diminish the significance of the bot's win, Greg Brockman of OpenAI said that it remains a big deal because of the way the AI learned to play the game. Previously , bots have built their knowledge from records of past victories won by humans, but the Dota bot learned primarily through experience. \n\"You have this system that has just played against itself, and it has learned robust enough strategies to beat the top pros. That’s not something you should take for granted,” Brockman said. “And it’s a big question for any machine learning system: How does complexity get into the model? Where does it come from?\" \nThe full story behind the AI victory won't really be known until a thorough analysis is released, but it is worth noting that once players were able to see the bot in action and got to know its tactics, they were able to compensate and beat it fairly handily. Even so, it's unquestionably a step on the path toward bigger and (maybe) better things, a point Musk mused on immediately after tweeting about the OpenAI's Dota 2 victory: If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. pic.twitter.com/2z0tiid0lc August 12, 2017 \nDendi, who was a good sport about the competition, is on the same page. Didn't wait until Machines going to start the war against Humanity and kicked vacuum cleaner with my leg ! August 12, 2017 ",

By Jasper Hamill 1st September 2017, 8:56 pm Updated: 1st September 2017, 9:57 pm Comments YOUTUBE has been accused of censorship after introducing a controversial new policy designed to reduce the audience for videos deemed to be \"inappropriate or offensive to some audiences\". \nThe Google-owned video site is now putting videos into a \"limited state\" if they are deemed controversial enough to be considered objectionable, but not hateful, pornographic or violent enough to be banned altogether. YouTube is by far the world's largest video publishing platform and streams one billion hours of footage every day \nThis policy was announced several months ago but has come into force in the past week, prompting anger among members of the YouTube community. \nThe Sun Online understands Google and YouTube staff refer to the tactic as \"tougher treatment\". \nOne prominent video-maker slammed the new scheme whilst WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange described the measures as \"economic censorship\". \nHowever, YouTube sees it as a way of maintaining freedom of speech and allowing discussion of controversial issues without resorting to the wholesale banning of videos. \nVideos which are put into a limited state cannot be embedded on other websites. \nThey also cannot be easily published on social media using the usual share buttons and other users cannot comment on them. This is the screen users are shown when they click on a video that has been 'limited' \nCrucially, the person who made the video will no longer receive any payment. \nEarlier this week, Julian Assange wrote: \"'Controversial' but contract-legal videos [which break YouTube's terms and conditions] cannot be liked, embedded or earn [money from advertising revenue]. \n\"What's interesting about the new method deployed is that it is a clear attempt at social engineering. It isn't just turning off the ads. \n\"It's turning off the comments, embeds, etc too. \n\"Everything possible to strangle the reach without deleting it.\" THE ADPOCALYPSE How YouTube stars joined forces to fight advertising policy change that threatened to ‘tear the site apart’ \nCriticism of YouTube's policies is most acute among people on the right of the political spectrum, who fear that Silicon Valley is dominated by the left and determined to silence opposing voices - a claim denied by tech giants like Facebook and Google. \nThe new YouTube rules were highlighted this week by Paul Joseph Watson, a globally famous British right wing YouTuber and editor-at-large of Infowars, who spoke out after saying a guest on his online show had one of her videos removed after the appearance. \nThe black female YouTuber, who uses the name RedPillBlack, made a video entitled \"WTF? Black Lives Matter Has A List of Demands for White People!\" in response to a member of the activist's group calls for white people to \" give up the home you own to a black or brown family \". \nThe video was part of a series which features an offensive racial term in its name, which we have decided not to publish, and criticises the BLM member's statement point by point. \nWe watched her video and whilst it's clear that many people might disagree with the political point she is making, the actual video did not appear to be offensive or gratuitous. \n\"Some people might watch the video and think I'm speaking out against black people,\" she said in the video. \n\"But what I'm doing here is speaking up for black people.\" \nThe video was allegedly banned but later reinstated following a series of tweets from Watson, which you can see below. YouTube DELETES a video made by a black woman decrying BLM's racism.This needs to be a national news story. https://t.co/VNDHMYCXPs — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 30, 2017 Hey @TeamYouTube - why are you silencing a black woman who is speaking out against racism?Shame on you. pic.twitter.com/tAmAdrcmJe — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 30, 2017 So YouTube rightly responded to complaints by restoring @RedPillBlack 's video.Though this proves their flagging system is broken. — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) August 31, 2017 \nOn Twitter, the vlogger RedPillBlack wrote: \"What does it mean when a company owned by rich white ppl begins censoring black people? Is this the white nationalism I should be scared of?\" \nShe added: \"They said it was for harassment and bullying. I literally just read the girl's list [of demands] out loud.\" \nReddit users are now building a record of all the videos which have been put into a limited state. \nMany of the videos have clearly offensive. \nOthers discuss controversial, contested and highly inflammatory scientific theories about the link between race and intelligence. \nNazi videos featured heavily on the current list, with Hitler's speeches and even the Nazi national anthem being limited. \nBut amongst material that is clearly shocking and likely to cause grave offence are videos which discuss political issues such as the migrant crisis using non-extreme language. You guide to YouTube's controversial new policy of 'limiting' access to videos Here is what YouTube has to say about the scheme on its support page: \nOur Community Guidelines prohibit hate speech that either promotes violence or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes. \nYouTube also prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organisations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism. \nSome borderline videos, such as those containing inflammatory religious or supremacist content without a direct call to violence or a primary purpose of inciting hatred, may not cross these lines for removal. \nFollowing user reports, if our review teams determine that a video is borderline under our policies, it may have some features disabled. \nThese videos will remain available on YouTube but will be placed behind a warning message and some features will be disabled, including comments, suggested videos and likes. These videos are also not eligible for ads. \nIf one of your videos has features disabled, we will send an email to notify you. \nYou can appeal the decision directly from a link in the email or by selecting the 'Appeal' link next to the video in Video Manager. Having features disabled on a video will not create a strike on your account. \nYou can tell a video has been put into a limited state because you have to click a button to watch it and are shown the words: \"The following content has been identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences. \n\"In response to user reports, we have disabled some features, such as comments, sharing and suggested videos, because this video contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive to some audiences.\" \nThe Sun Online has learned that Google has been in contact with members of religious communities to discuss getting the balance right between censorship and open discussion. \nWe understand that the editor of a prominent Jewish newspaper advised the tech giant against simply blocking videos discussing disturbing subjects, suggesting that the best way to combat these views is to debate and defeat them in the open. \nThe new YouTube policy allows videos to be seen whilst stopping their makers from earning money and preventing them from easily spreading their message or having it automatically shown to others through the site's \"recommended videos\" service. \nIt is understood that the intention of the new \"limited state\" policy is to target content which is objectionable, but not illegal. \nGoogle uses a team of thousands of community moderators to police content and decide whether it should be banned or limited. YouTube star Caspar Lee shares his story of battling Tourette's Syndrome \nThese teams are based at various sites around the world, a strategy intended to stop people from one side of the political spectrum coming together to dominate decisions and target specific content makers or groups. \nGoogle does employ machine learning to target videos which are pornographic or depict extremist acts of violence. \nThis involves training computers to look for telltale signs of sex or violence, although Google does not publically reveal what its machine learning system is looking for. \nTheoretically, a good way to root out porn would be to ask computers to look out for naked flesh or exaggerated groans, whilst machines could also be taught to recognise ISIS flags or look out for orange jumpsuits to target extremist vids. \nFinal decisions on whether to remove or limit content are taken by humans, who also investigate complaints from users about videos. \nThese staff members make their decisions using strict criteria set out by Google and YouTube. \nHowever, the tech giant does not make these guidelines public - a strategy intended to stop people making videos designed to narrowly skirt its rules. Anjem Choudary guilty of inviting support for ISIS on YouTube \nThe \"tougher treatment\" system is in its early stages and is likely to provoke more controversy in the coming months, particularly in an era where political debate online is highly polarised and extremely passionate. \nRight-wingers on the internet believe Silicon Valley is dead set on censoring conservative websites and channels, taking its cue from over-sensitive members of Generation Snowflake who are known for taking offence too easily. \nAt the same time, left-wingers think the right is spreading hate and must be silenced for the good of society. \nThe \"culture war\" between these two sides shows no signs of abating - and YouTube is the frontline in this increasingly vicious battle of ideas.

      "text": "07:00 am Google's New Street View Cameras Will Help Algorithms Index The Real World Steve Silverman helped build cameras for two NASA rovers that went to Mars. In the less exotic landscape of a Google parking lot, he looks up fondly at his latest creation, bolted onto the roof of a Hyundai hatchback. The gawky assemblage almost doubles the car’s height: four white legs holding up a vertical black stalk sporting eight cameras. “We thought about covering it up, but we’re kind of nerds,” Silverman says. “We’re proud of it.” Silverman and his team build the hardware that captures imagery for Google Street View, the project that since 2007 has put panoramas of more than 10 million miles of roads, buildings, and the occasional act of public urination online for all to see. The new camera design, the first major upgrade in eight years, started regularly patrolling the streets last month. The data that’s just starting to come back will strengthen Google’s digital grip on the world. As you might expect if you think back to the camera in your 2009 cell phone, Street View imagery is about to get a lot clearer. Look forward to sliding through the world from your couch in higher resolution and punchier colors. But Google’s new hardware wasn’t designed with just human eyes in mind. The car-top rig includes two cameras that capture still HD images looking out to either side of the vehicle. They're there to feed clearer, closer shots of buildings and street signs into Google’s image recognition algorithms. Those algorithms can pore over millions of signs and storefronts without getting tired. By hoovering up vast amounts of information visible on the world’s streets—signs, business names, perhaps even opening hours posted in the window of your corner deli—Google hopes to improve its already formidable digital mapping database. The company, built on the back of algorithms that indexed the web, is using the same strategy on the real world. Global surveillance The idea behind Street View is nearly as old as Google itself. In 2001, three years after the company’s founding, CEO Larry Page took a videotape he’d shot driving around the Bay Area into Stanford’s graphics lab. He asked researchers there to figure out a way to summarize it in images, and they began a project dubbed “ crawling the physical web .” Its technology was absorbed by Google in 2006, when the company’s cars first hit the roads ahead of Street View’s public launch the following year. A decade later, Street View cars have snapped more than 80 billion photos in thousands of cities and 85 countries. The company’s conventional mapping data is even more extensive. But Google still hungers for a better index of the world. Jen Fitzpatrick, the vice president who heads the company’s maps division, blames that on us. “People are coming to us every day with harder and deeper questions,” she says. The first time you searched Google Maps or Street View you probably typed in a street address—perhaps your own. Fitzpatrick says the company now gets tougher queries that require a fresher, more detailed digital model of the world, like “What’s a Thai place open now that does delivery to my address?” She wants her service to handle queries that assume knowledge of what the world looks like: “What’s the name of the pink store next to the church on the corner?” Google’s push to get us talking with its Siri-style virtual assistant encourages us to be more conversational in our demands. “These are questions we can only answer if we have richer and deeper information,” Fitzpatrick says. Google’s huge investment in machine learning and AI provides a natural way to get that information. Thanks to recent research inside the maps division, when a Street View car captures photos of a stretch of road, algorithms can now automatically create new addresses in the company’s maps database by locating and transcribing any street names and numbers. Street View was the first of Google's product groups to use the company's powerful custom AI chips , dubbed TPUs. The team's system has learned to figure out abbreviations, such as “AV.” for avenida , by taking hints from other signs in the country where they’re spelled out in full, and other clues in Google's maps data. Software has also been trained to recognize business names, and is smart enough to ignore visual trip hazards like the giant Bridgestone logo that might dwarf the name of a tire shop. Higher quality images coming from the new hardware now atop Google’s Street View vehicles will allow those systems to extract information like that more reliably. “From a machine learning perspective, everything gets better,” says Andrew Lookingbill, an engineer working on the technology. It will also help his team’s efforts to build new software even better at understanding the world. They’re thinking about trying to automatically recognize different types of business from their appearance and reading finer-grained information like opening hours signs. Google New territory Decoding Street View imagery with algorithms can be especially useful in places where roads, cities, and businesses are changing fastest—the less-developed economies where Google and its competitors hope to find their next few billion users . The government of India reported this year that it has recently laid an average of 14 miles of new road every day. Street View went live this summer in Nigerian megacity Lagos—population 21 million. Fitzpatrick says that Google’s image-scouring algorithms could help translate the new imagery into a significant bump in map quality. Google sells ads inside maps, so new coverage and accuracy can translate into more revenue if they draw new users and usage to the service. Google wants you to help feed its image-hungry algorithms. The tech industry’s recent interest in virtual reality has made 360 degree cameras relatively cheap. This summer, Google began certifying some cameras as “ Street View ready ,” meaning you can upload your own panoramas through the Street View mobile app to live on the company’s service. That footage will be processed by Google’s image recognition algorithms for fresh map data just like its own imagery. Google is counting on crowdsourcing to make Street View data fresher than it is now. “The expectation is that Google has the world indexed,” says Charles Armstrong, a product manager for Street View. “But it never lives up to expectations.” Google’s Street View mobile app rewards individuals who contribute photos with virtual trophies, and it will even suggest local spots to take your camera. More significantly, Armstrong predicts companies, tourist boards, and even governments will soon be driving their own camera-toting cars to make sure the world gets an up-to-date view of their streets and cities. All the upgrades to Street View could help Google maintain its prime position in digital maps. The company is the most prominent among the handful of leading global mapping projects. The other heavy hitters are HERE, owned by a coalition of German auto companies ; TomTom, known for stand-alone GPS units and watches; and collaborative project Open Street Map. “Each one measures themselves against the others,” says Alyssa Wright, president of the US chapter of Open Street Map. (Apple’s relatively young mapping operation licenses data from TomTom.) In a world where most of us carry GPS-equipped smartphones, maps data is important for much more than just directions. “Mapping is fundamental to how we build our digital future, from autonomous vehicles to dating apps,” says Wright. Street View’s new cameras and Google’s push for crowdsourced imagery could also lead the company into new privacy controversies. Concern about Google making ephemeral public scenes into permanent internet fixtures has rumbled, and occasionally flared, since Street View began. Germany and Austria are largely invisible on Google Street View, and have been for years, after the company got in trouble for logging Wi-Fi data with Street View vehicles. Google's fleet only recently returned to both countries. In 2012, Switzerland’s highest court ordered Google to cut down its cameras to prevent them from peeping over walls and to blur certain places such as women’s shelters. Fitzpatrick flicks away the suggestion that higher quality imagery could lead to more privacy concerns. “We haven’t seen or heard of places where there are additional sensitivities,” she says. Google will continue to automatically blur faces and license plates on its own Street View images. But it won’t do that by default on crowdsourced footage, instead leaving it up to users to choose whether to use Google’s blurring technology when they upload new 360 photos. How much more could Google extract from Street View using image processing algorithms? A lot. Earlier this year Stanford researchers, including professor Fei-Fei Li , now chief scientist at Google’s cloud division, showed they could predict income, race, and voting patterns for US cities with software that logs the make, model, and year of cars in Street View photos. When asked if anything like that was planned at Google, a spokesperson would say only that the company is always looking for ways to use Street View data to improve the company's platforms, including beyond maps. Processing Street View images from Google and its users might also help the self-driving cars of fellow Alphabet subsidiary Waymo understand the world. “The team collaborates on things from time to time,” is all Fitzpatrick will say about that. But her team has as much to gain in return from Waymo. Back in that Google parking lot, camera-wizard Silverman confesses that trolling highways in a Street View car sporting one of his team’s devices isn’t much fun. “After a day you’re ready to not be a bus driver and go back to engineering,” he says. Just as self-driving vehicles would shift the economics of on-demand ride services, not having to pay people to be bored behind the wheel would be a boon to Street View. The company’s algorithmic index of the physical world may just be getting started.

Over 30 years he’s personally accumulated over 150,000 maps and he's just donated them all to Stanford University. ",

      "text": "A Frightening AI Can Determine Whether a Person Is Gay With 91 Percent Accuracy “Essentially, we believe that further erosion of privacy is inevitable.” \nArtificial intelligence now has the capability to guess a person's sexual orientation based on photos of their face with startling accuracy, according to new research from Stanford University. In a peer-reviewed paper to be published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , researchers demonstrate the capabilities of a novel machine learning algorithm that can tell from a handful of photos whether a person identified as gay or straight on a dating website. \nThe work, conducted by Yilun Wang and Michal Kosinski, is raising serious ethical concerns about how it could be abused to further marginalize members of the LGBT community. For one, the researchers' pessimistic view of privacy is at odds with the work of individuals like Sarah Jamie Lewis , a cybersecurity researcher who studies privacy, specifically for queer people . \n\"All this paper does is reinforce stereotypes and categories that the queer community is fighting so hard to break,\" Lewis told me over Twitter direct message. \"But even if we accepted the paper's premise that someone can appear visually queer then the paper still has major ethical issues around participant consent and the overall aim of the research,\" she explained, referring to how the photos used were pulled from a publicly available dating site instead of gathered with the participants' knowledge. \nThe deep neural network used by the researchers correctly distinguished between straight and gay men 81 percent of the time, and between straight and gay women in 71 percent of instances when provided one image. When the algorithm had five images of a person to analyze, it could predict whether a man was gay 91 percent of the time and a woman 83 percent of the time. It was trained on a sample of 35,326 facial images scraped from an unnamed US dating website, and used people's stated preferences as evidence of whether they were gay or straight. The algorithm was also tested on a separate sample of Facebook data. \nThe research found that both gay men and women tended to have \"gender-atypical facial morphology, expression, and grooming styles.\" Gay men were found to have narrower jaws, longer noses, and larger foreheads than their straight counterparts. Gay women were found to have larger jaws and smaller foreheads compared to straight women. \n\"The differences in femininity observed in this study were subtle, spread across many facial features, and apparent only when examining averaged images of many faces,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. \nThe research was limited in terms of what it could determine about human gender and sexuality. For one, people of color were not included, nor were transgender or bisexual people. In fact, the paper does not mention transgender individuals at all. Still, the research has troubling implications for an already marginalized group, and demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be trained to perform ethically dubious tasks. \nIt's not hard to imagine the algorithm being used by an anti-LGBTQ authoritarian regime to target or track individuals, or by parents who want to determine the sexual orientation of their children. But the researchers insist they're aware of the implications of their work. \n\"We were really disturbed by these results and spent much time considering whether they should be made public at all. We did not want to enable the very risks that we are warning against,\" Kosinski and Wang wrote in author notes published along with the paper. \nBut they say that they ultimately decided to publish the work in order to warn LGBTQ activists of the risks they are facing: \"We believe that people deserve to know about these risks and have the opportunity to take preventive measures,\" the researchers said in the notes. \"We did not create a privacy-invading tool, but rather showed that basic and widely used methods pose serious privacy threats.\" \nWang and Kosinski argue that privacy on the internet is already dead. \"Essentially, we believe that further erosion of privacy is inevitable, and the safety of gay and other minorities hinges not on the right to privacy but on the enforcement of human rights, and tolerance of societies and governments,\" they write in their study notes. \"In order for the post-privacy world to be safer and hospitable, it must be inhabited by well-educated people who are radically intolerant of intolerance.\" \n\"There may very well be useful, fascinating research to be done here that will benefit the queer community—but it needs to be done ethically and consensually and by people who understand the issues at hand,\" Lewis told me.",

      "text": "The days of the large, globe-like cameras on top of Google Street View cars may be slowly disappearing. Google has refreshed the design for the cameras used to capture Street View images, which is its first significant upgrade in eight years, reports Wired . The new camera rig will help capture photos that are clearer, higher in resolution, and more vivid in color. Like the old design, the rig will attach to a vehicle’s roof, but the smaller ball on top now features just seven cameras (down from 15) fitted with 20 megapixel sensors. The rig also plays host to two cameras that take still HD photos, and two “cans” on the front and back for laser radar.\nGoogle’s machine learning and AI capabilities mean that when photos are captured by a Street View car, algorithms can detect and note relevant street names and numbers, automatically adding them to Google’s database. The software can also identify business names and logos. Google is working to better the software, taking its capabilities further so one day it can recognize different types of stores based on what they look like, and reading smaller signage that show details like opening hours.\n“What’s the name of the pink store next to the church on the corner?” Better technology should lead to better source data for Google’s machine learning capabilities, which will allow it to expand Google’s search and Assistant functions. In an example to Wired , Google’s vice president and head of its mapping arm Jen Fitzpatrick says in the future, Google Maps might be able to answer more detailed questions that reference how the world looks, such as “What’s the name of the pink store next to the church on the corner?” Those questions can only be answered if “we have richer and deeper information,” she says.\nGoogle Street View has been taking photos since 2007, and its fleet of Street View vehicles include cars, snow mobiles, trikes, and a trolley that captures photos indoors in places like museums. The camera rig has even been outfitted onto a backpack to take images of places that aren’t easily reached by vehicle.\nWe’ve reached out to Google for additional details on the new rig’s rollout.\nUpdate Sep 5th, 1:41 PM: Article updated to clarify the technology in the new rig.",

Photograph: Jorge Torres/EPA LGBT rights LGBT groups denounce 'dangerous' AI that uses your face to guess sexuality \nTwo prominent LGBT groups have criticized a Stanford study as ‘junk science’, but a professor who co-authored it said he was perplexed by the criticisms View more sharing options Saturday 9 September 2017 01.23 BST Last modified on Saturday 9 September 2017 16.22 BST \nA Stanford University study showing that artificial intelligence (AI) can accurately guess whether people are gay or straight based on their faces has sparked a swift backlash from LGBT rights activists who fear this kind of technology could be used to harm queer people. \nThe research , which went viral this week, used a sample of online dating photos, limited only to white users, to demonstrate that an algorithm could correctly distinguish between gay and straight men 81% of the time and 74% for women, suggesting machines can potentially have much better “gaydar” than humans. \nThe Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and Glaad, two of the most prominent LGBTQ organizations in the US, slammed the study on Friday as “dangerous and flawed … junk science” that could be used to out gay people across the globe and put them at risk. The advocates also criticized the study for excluding people of color and bisexual and transgender people and claimed the research made overly broad and inaccurate assumptions about gender and sexuality. New AI can work out whether you're gay or straight from a photograph Read more \nMichal Kosinski, co-author of the study and an assistant professor at Stanford, told the Guardian that he was perplexed by the criticisms, arguing that the machine-learning technology already exists and that a driving force behind the study was to expose potentially dangerous applications of AI and push for privacy safeguards and regulations. \n“One of my obligations as a scientist is that if I know something that can potentially protect people from falling prey to such risks, I should publish it,” he said, adding that his critics were encouraging people to ignore the real risks of this technology by trying to discredit his work. “Rejecting the results because you don’t agree with them on an ideological level … you might be harming the very people that you care about.” \nThe study, first reported in the Economist , has sparked heated debate about the biological origins of sexual orientation and the ethics of facial-detection technology, which is becoming increasingly advanced and prevalent in society. \n“Imagine for a moment the potential consequences if this flawed research were used to support a brutal regime’s efforts to identify and/or persecute people they believed to be gay,” Ashland Johnson, HRC’s director of public education and research, said in a statement. “Stanford should distance itself from such junk science rather than lending its name and credibility to research that is dangerously flawed and leaves the world – and this case, millions of people’s lives – worse and less safe than before.” Co-author Michal Kosinski: ‘There is a moral question here. Should we publish it and ... even potentially give some bad guys some ideas, or just not publish it?’ Photograph: Lauren Bamford \nKosinski has not actually released any AI program that the public could use (and declined the Guardian’s request to test the algorithm). He also noted that the findings support LGBT rights by providing further evidence that sexual orientation has biological routes and that being gay is not a choice. \n“It’s a great argument against all of those religious groups and other demagogues who say, ‘Why don’t you just change or just conform?’ You can’t stop, because you’re born this way,” he said. \nBut the LGBT groups argued the study was too narrow by only using photos that people chose to put on dating profiles and by failing to test a diverse pool. \nKosinski and his co-author Yilun Wang acknowledged these limitations in the paper, claiming that they could not find sufficient numbers of non-white gay people. The authors have not disclosed the dating site they used, but Kosinski said in an interview that the majority of profiles they were reviewing were white. \nEven though the researchers claimed they couldn’t find enough queer people of color (despite polls suggesting that non-white people are more likely to identify as LGBT than white people), Kosinski said he suspected his algorithm would perform fairly accurately across different races. Giving the 'gay cure' quack a TV platform is an abuse of free speech | Owen Jones Read more \nAsked about the calls for Stanford to denounce the study, Paul Pfleiderer, senior associate dean for academic affairs at the graduate business school, said in a statement: “Publication of research findings in academic journals allows the interpretation of those findings and the research methodologies used to obtain them to be scrutinized by academics in the field and are appropriately a matter for discussion and debate.” \nKosinski said he strongly weighed the risk of publishing the study at all: “There is a kind of moral question here. Should we publish it and make people upset and even potentially give some bad guys some ideas, or just not publish it and warn people?” \nGiven that private corporations and governments are already using this type of software, he said he felt obligated to move forward with the paper. \nKosinski added that he would be pleased if another researcher debunked his work: “I hope that someone will go and fail to replicate this study … I would be the happiest person in the world if I was wrong.” \nContact the author: ",

      "text": "'Did you get it all?' Experimental 'pen' could help surgeons detect remaining cancer instantly In samples taken from 253 people in U.S., device was 96% accurate in identifying cancers, researchers find By Amina Zafar, CBC News Posted: Sep 07, 2017 10:01 AM ET Last Updated: Sep 07, 2017 10:13 AM ET Scientist Jialing Zhang demonstrates using the MasSpec Pen to analyze a human tissue sample. (University of Texas at Austin) Related Stories Watch surgeons attack B.C. woman's brain tumour with new laser method \nA prototype \"pen\" technology aims to give cancer surgeons a better sense of whether they've removed all of a tumour while in the operating room. \nThe new approach strives to answer a patient's question after surgeons remove a tumour: \"Did you get it all?\" \nTo say yes confidently, doctors often send a sample of the tissue in question to a pathologist to freeze, check and test under a microscope. It's the gold standard for accuracy, but takes at least 30 minutes per sample. As the clock ticks, the patient remains under anesthesia. \nCancer surgeons estimate that in up to 20 per cent of some operations, traces of tumour remain at the margin or edges of where they've cut, which can lead to repeated surgeries or recurrence of cancer. \nIn this week's issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine , U.S. researchers describe an experimental pen-like tool for surgeons that quickly draws samples through a tube to test for traces of cancerous tissue in the OR, with results within 10 seconds. \nThe technology could achieve the goals of more precise, quicker and safer surgery, said study co-author Dr. James Suliburk, chief of endocrine surgery at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \n\"It allows us in real time to test tissue from the operative field as we actually operate and ensure that we've resected the tumour to appropriate surgical margins,\" Suliburk said. \nIn a series of experiments, investigators in Texas tested the pen-sized prototype tip that's connected to a conventional mass spectrometer, which varies from the size of a laser printer to a fridge. \nIn validation tests on samples taken from 253 people with known lung, ovary, thyroid or breast tumours from a tissue bank, the device was 96 per cent accurate in identifying cancers, the team said. Giant leaps forward \nThe researchers also used what they call the \"MasSpec Pen\" to reliably identify breast tumours in mice. They hope to use it in surgery on human patients early in 2018 followed by clinical trials. \n\"Usually we take small step forwards and along the way we take several steps back,\" Suliburk said. \"Because of our multidisciplinary research team … we've been able to take giant leaps forward with only small steps backwards. And that's something that in modern-day medical research seldom happens.\" Needless breast cancer imaging common in Ontario — study \nSuliburk envisions the technology eliminating the need to send out tissue to be analyzed under the microscope. Researchers say the MasSpec Pen can non-destructively analyze human tissue samples to identify cancer. (University of Texas at Austin) \nLivia Schiavinato Eberlin, an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin, envisioned the technology. Co-author and campus colleague Thomas Milner, a professor of biomedical engineering, worked with her team to put together a prototype that could be held against a patient's tissue. \nIt's biocompatible, since it just takes water deposits from the surface of the tissue. Then samples are transported through special tubing to the mass spectrometer, said Milner. Deciphering tumour fingerprints \nNext, machine learning software analyzes the \"fingerprint\" of metabolites from the sample to find predictably higher concentrations within a tumour. In seconds, the surgical team sees the final result on a screen displaying \"cancer\" or \"normal.\" \n\"Because the imaging and tools are so good, these treatments can be done predictably and reliably,\" Milner said. \nThere's a whole fleet of similar technologies coming to the operating room. For instance, the iKnife and its accompanying mass spectrometer samples the sharp-smelling smoke that rises when surgeons heat tissue as they cut. Other experimental modes are based on ultrasound or light. \nConventional pathology will remain paramount until it's proven that the molecular fingerprint from samples taken from next to a tumour are truly a cancerous cell, cautioned Dr. John Rudan, head of surgery at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. He was not involved in the study. New laser method could help neurosurgeons get at hard-to-reach tumours \n\"How does the clinician react to that area that happens to light up in the tissue adjacent to where you think the tumour is? We don't know what the answer is going to be yet. It's going to take a while for us to actually understand that.\" \nRudan sees how the MasSpec Pen could help surgeons to determine if surgical margins are clear. He's also aware of limitations on what it could accomplish. For instance, tumours are three-dimensional and need to be scanned all over, yet the tool itself lacks depth perception. \n\"I see this as a very interesting type of technology that will probably have a place in surgical oncology,\" said Rudan, who holds the university's Britton Smith Chair in surgery. \nAt Queen's, Rudan and his colleagues are using an image-guided tool on frozen breast cancer specimens. Part of the challenge is that breast tissue moves between the time when it's sampled, removed and analyzed. Without tracking technologies, surgeons can be working blind when they return to a particular spot. \nThe MasSpec Pen prototype hasn't been used in a real surgery. It could take years to determine if it's valid, cost-effective and ultimately improves survival rates. ",

PHOTOS: SUTD, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES Published Tristan Jeyaretnam \nResearchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) have come up with a portable and cost-efficient device that can detect malaria within 30 seconds. \nPresently, the gold standard for diagnosis of the mosquito-borne disease is examining a patient's blood smears through a laboratory microscope. This tool is not only bulky, but it also functions more slowly than the new technique. \nThe SUTD team's new and improved cytometer - a cell-counting device - minimises the time taken for diagnosis, which normally may be hours. \nMalaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms include shaking chills, high fever and sweating. Get The Straits Times \nThe new device, primarily composed of a raised lens and colour camera, does away with the laborious process of manually counting infected blood cells to determine the percentage of the patient's red blood cells that are infected with malaria. \nInstead, it employs image processing and machine-learning algorithms to count these cells digitally. \nIt is also a much cheaper alternative to the cytometers within research facilities that have the same capabilities for malaria detection. \nThe malaria cytometer costs US$600 (S$820), as opposed to any high-end commercial flow cytometer, which would typically have a US$100,000 price tag. \nSaid Dr Ye Ai, one of two assistant professors involved in the research: \"This portable image-based cytometer has great potential as an accurate and cost-effective tool for routine malaria diagnosis in the field or resource-limited regions\". \nAdded Dr Rajesh Chandramohanadas, the second assistant professor: \"With our current portable cytometer, we are able to detect very low levels of infection from laboratory samples.\" \nAccording to a report by the World Health Organisation in 2015, 1.4 million people across South-east Asia alone are at risk of malaria. \nSingapore, despite being malaria- free since 1982, is also vulnerable to the disease, due to the influx of travellers and foreign workers. \nWith the malaria parasites' increasing resistance to current drugs, the device could help detect the disease fast, so that the appropriate medications can be given before complications arise. \nCommenting on the effort, malaria expert Kevin Tan of the National University of Singapore's Department of Microbiology and Immunology said: \"Singapore hospitals may also find this useful in place of human operators who are prone to fatigue and subjective analysis.\" \nThe SUTD team is now looking for additional funding to do a larger trial in the field. Their article was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PLOS One.   'Local team finds speedy test for malaria'.  ",

      "text": "Those poorly produced \"videos\" on your  Facebook   news feed are getting cut off.\nOn Thursday, Facebook announced two updates that will put an end to fake video clickbait. In the next few weeks, trick images and videos are going to be buried in your news feed, as Facebook's algorithm moves to demote them.  \nFacebook is cracking down on \"clickbait\" posts with fake video play buttons.\nFacebook For a while, Facebook's algorithm had been pushing videos to the top of news feeds,  in an effort to expand its platform . Thirsty spammers took notice and flooded pages with hordes of low-quality videos. The majority of them were really just still images with a song in the background, sometimes it was silent audio.\nBasically, they disguised the same pictures and memes you'd seen before as videos, prompting Facebook's algorithm to promote them on your news feed. The videos were able to rake in the extra views and ad money. \nAnother trick was to add a fake \"play\" button to the images, which people would click, sending them to another website.\n\"Spammers often use fake play buttons to trick people into click links to low quality websites,\" Facebook engineers Baraa Hamodi, Zahir Bokhari and Yun Zhang said  in a blog post . \"These deceptive spammers also use static images disguised as videos to trick eople into clicking on a low quality experience.\"\nA Facebook spokesman said those clickbait videos and pictures won't be removed, but they will be severely pushed down in priority on news feeds.\nIt will be using machine learning to automatically track play buttons on any images, the company said. \nTo hunt down videos that are really just images in disguise, Facebook is using a process it calls \"motion scoring,\" that tracks movement in video. If the video doesn't have that much movement, it could be flagged as spam. \n\"While the prevalence is statistically low, the frustration expressed by people who use Facebook who encounter these deceptive practices is high,\" a spokesman said.\nFacebook expects the shift to cut off a massive amount of traffic heading to these phony pages. \nThis article originally appeared on CNET .",

      "text": " Photo Credit Minh Uong/The New York Times A pathbreaking new study of online conversations among economists describes and quantifies a workplace culture that appears to amount to outright hostility toward women in parts of the economics profession.\nAlice H. Wu, who will start her doctoral studies at Harvard next year, completed the research in an award-winning senior thesis at the University of California, Berkeley. Her paper has been making the rounds among leading economists this summer, and prompting urgent conversations.\nDavid Card, an eminent economist at Berkeley who was Ms. Wu’s thesis adviser, told me that she had produced “a very disturbing report.”\nThe underrepresentation of women in top university economics departments is already well documented , but it has been difficult to evaluate claims about workplace culture because objectionable conversations rarely occur in the open. Whispered asides at the water cooler are hard to observe, much less measure.\nContinue But the intersection of two technological shifts has opened up new avenues for research. First, many “water cooler” conversations have migrated online, leaving behind a computerized archive. In addition, machine-learning techniques have been adapted to explore patterns in large bodies of text, and as a result, it’s now possible to quantify the tenor of that kind of gossip.\nThis is what Ms. Wu did in her paper , “Gender Stereotyping in Academia: Evidence From Economics Job Market Rumors Forum.”\nMs. Wu mined more than a million posts from an anonymous online message board frequented by many economists. The site, commonly known as econjobrumors.com (its full name is Economics Job Market Rumors ), began as a place for economists to exchange gossip about who is hiring and being hired in the profession. Over time, it evolved into a virtual water cooler frequented by economics faculty members, graduate students and others.\nIt now constitutes a useful, if imperfect, archive for studying what economists talk about when they talk among themselves. Because all posts are anonymous, it is impossible to know whether the authors are men or women, or how representative they are of the broader profession. Indeed, some may not even be economists. But it is clearly an active and closely followed forum, particularly among younger members of the field.\nMs. Wu set up her computer to identify whether the subject of each post is a man or a woman. The simplest version involves looking for references to “she,” “her,” “herself” or “he,” “him,” “his” or “himself.”\n She then adapted machine-learning techniques to ferret out the terms most uniquely associated with posts about men and about women.\nThe 30 words most uniquely associated with discussions of women make for uncomfortable reading.\nIn order, that list is: hotter, lesbian, bb (internet speak for “baby”), sexism, tits, anal, marrying, feminazi, slut, hot, vagina, boobs, pregnant, pregnancy, cute, marry, levy, gorgeous, horny, crush, beautiful, secretary, dump, shopping, date, nonprofit, intentions, sexy, dated and prostitute.\nThe parallel list of words associated with discussions about men reveals no similarly singular or hostile theme. It includes words that are relevant to economics, such as adviser, Austrian (a school of thought in economics) mathematician, pricing, textbook and Wharton (the University of Pennsylvania business school that is President Trump’s alma mater). More of the words associated with discussions about men have a positive tone, including terms like goals, greatest and Nobel. And to the extent that there is a clearly gendered theme, it is a schoolyard battle for status: The list includes words like bully, burning and fought.\nIn her paper, Ms. Wu says the anonymity of these online posts “eliminates any social pressure participants may feel to edit their speech” and so perhaps allowed her “to capture what people believe but would not openly say.”\nIn order to more systematically evaluate the underlying themes of these discussions, Ms. Wu moved beyond analyzing specific words to exploring the broad topics under discussion.\nThis part of her analysis reveals that discussions about men are more likely to be confined to topics like economics itself and professional advice (with terms including career, interview or placement).\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

But anonymously sourced falsehoods can spread like wildfire, harming people’s careers.\nSilvana Tenreyro, a professor at the London School of Economics and a former chairwoman of the European Economics Association’s women’s committee, told me that “every year a crisis or two arose” from rumors started on the forum, “with the typical target being a female student.”\nSome economists say they find the discourse on econjobrumors.com to be a breath of fresh air. George Borjas, an economics professor at Harvard, wrote on his blog last summer that he found the forum “refreshing.”\nProfessor Borjas said: “There’s still hope for mankind when many of the posts written by a bunch of over-educated young social scientists illustrate a throwing off of the shackles of political correctness and reflect mundane concerns that more normal human beings share: prestige, sex, money, landing a job, sex, professional misconduct, gossip, sex. …”\nAfter receiving a copy of Ms. Wu’s paper, Mr. Borjas said: “While there is some value in that forum, there is also a great deal that is offensive and disturbing. The problem is I’m not sure exactly where to draw line.”\nProfessor Currie warned Ms. Wu that writing about these issues was likely to make her the focus of online harassment. Ms. Wu said she was undeterred.\nIf there’s an optimistic story to be told about the future of economics, Ms. Wu may well represent it. It’s unusual for a senior thesis to have this sort of impact, but she is no ordinary young economist. At only 22, she also defies the stereotype that women are reluctant mathematicians and coders, as her analysis shows her to be adept at both. Professor Card described her as “an extraordinary student.”\nShe is also tenacious, and when I asked Ms. Wu whether the sexism she documented had led her to reconsider pursuing a career in economics, she said that it had not. “You see those bad things happen and you want to prove yourself,” she said.\n Indeed, she told me that her research suggests “that more women should be in this field changing the landscape.”\nCorrection: August 27, 2017\nAn article last Sunday about hostility toward women in economics misstated the current views of George Borjas, a Harvard professor, about Economics Job Market Rumors, an online forum, after he received a copy of a paper by Alice H. Wu, who will be starting doctoral studies at Harvard next year, about the forum. Mr. Borjas said, “While there is some value in that forum, there is also a great deal that is offensive and disturbing. The problem is I’m not sure exactly where to draw line.” He did not say that all his views about the forum were unchanged.",

      "text": "Elon Musk Claims Smart Robots Worse Threat than North Korea The Associated Press by Chriss W. Street 14 Aug 2017 Newport Beach, CA 0 \n14 Aug, 2017 14 Aug, 2017 SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is trying to crank up support for his $120 billion escape mission to Mars by claiming robots with artificial intelligence are a bigger threat than North Korea. Musk took advantage of the military sabre-rattling last week to tweet on August 11: “If you’re not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea.” Musk tweeted a follow-up warning that an OpenAI machine, where Musk is a partner, just won the Dota 2 eSports Championship against the best human competitors in the world.\nadvertisement Musk knows a lot about artificial intelligence, as an initial venture capital investor in Demis Hassabis’s Deep Mind in 2010. Hassabiss promised his company could move the state of robotics to fully utilize artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Deep Mind described the relationship between the 3 as a series of concentric circles, with AI as the macro field, ML as a subtopic of AI, and DL as the ultimate refinement of ML. Musk cashed out to the tune of $400 million in a 2014 acquisition by Google.\nFears of artificial intelligence have been around since Czech science fiction writer Karel Čapek’s 1921 play ‘ R. U. R. ’, which coined the word “robot” for a mechanical man. Hollywood filmmakers mastered evil machines such as HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey ; Skynet in Terminator ; the AI called B.R.A.I.N. in the film 9 ; and many others.\nBreitbart News has reported that in the three years since he cashed out of Deep Mind, Musk has used a TED Talk forum, numerous media interviews, and even a governors’ conference to warn that the rapid improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will eventually create robots that will turn on their human masters.\nMusk’s solution is for the U.S. federal government to spend trillions of dollars funding his SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) 49-million-mile trip to Mars as a precautionary escape route if machines become cranky and decide to eliminate lazy humans.\nMusk told Recode that sending the first 12 astronauts to Mars in a proposed 380 foot-by-38 foot ITS vehicle by 2024 will cost the U.S. government about $10 billion per person. But Musk stated that the $120 billion price tag should not be a show-stopper, because the price will drop to $200,000 if 1 million earthlings sign up to colonize the Red Planet.\nBasic artificial intelligence is making machines smarter and allowing standardized tools to be relied upon to make decisions in the corporate world. Rudimentary machine language is already allowing for facile recognition, voice commands, and language translations. Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa chatbots will increasingly allow for voice interaction with humans and other machines.\nDeep learning will eventually take artificial intelligence to the level that machines will be capable of mimicking how the human brain works through the use of artificial neural networks . A deep learning machine will operate a system of artificial neurons that can be charged to provide binary, yes/no, responses to basic questions about a piece of data.\nMusk knows that it could take decades before layering thousands and then millions of these artificial neural networks becomes possible to allow a deep learning machine to generate reliable recommendations and/or interactions as outputs, without changing the underlying coding.\nSpaceX may receive hundreds of billions in federal government cash for Musk to start his escape colony on Mars. But why would the machines not follow him there?\n  Breitbart California , National Security , Tech , Alexa , Amazon , Apple , chatbots , Cortana , deep learning , Dota 2 eSports Championship , Elon Musk , ITS , machine intelligence , Mars , Microsoft , OpenAI , paceX Interplanetary Transport System , Siri , SpaceX",

      "text": "print \nThe AI predicted some fan theories would come true concerning Daenerys and Jon. HBO \nIf you're hanging out feverishly to find out what happens after this weeks' drama-filled season seven finale of Game of Thrones , you're not alone. \nWith the TV show now firmly ahead of the books, fans might have to wait until 2019 to see how George R.R. Martin's epic saga wraps up. \nSo to give us some much-needed new material to over-analyze in the meantime, an algorithm has started to write the sixth book for us, and its predictions back up some long-held fan theories. \nAfter feeding a type of AI known as a recurrent neural network the roughly 5,000 pages of Martin's five previous books, software engineer Zack Thoutt has used the algorithm to predict what will happen next. \nAnd it might be the best we get for a while, because, let's face it, most of us are so sick of waiting that we've pretty much given up on Martin delivering The Winds of Winter anytime soon... even Martin himself . \nGeorge R.R. Martin and the much awaited \"Winds of Winter.\" Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty \nWarning: fan theories and season seven spoilers ahead. \nAccording to the AI's predictions, some long-held fan theories do play out - in the five chapters generated by the algorithm so far, Jaime ends up killing Cersei , Jon rides a dragon , and Varys poisons Daenerys . \n\"Jaime killed Cersei and was cold and full of words, and Jon thought he was the wolf now, and white harbor...\" begins chapter five . \nYou can read all the chapters in full on the GitHub page for the project . Each chapter starts with a character's name, just like Martin's actual books. \nBut in addition to backing up what many of us already suspect will happen, the AI also introduces some fairly unexpected plot turns that we're pretty sure aren't going to be mirrored in either the TV show or Martin's books, so we wouldn't get too excited just yet. \nFor example, in the algorithm's first chapter , written from Tyrion's perspective, Sansa turns out to be a Baratheon: \n\"I feared Master Sansa, Ser,\" Ser Jaime reminded her. \"She Baratheon is one of the crossing. The second sons of your onion concubine.\" \nThere's also the introduction of a strange, pirate-like new character called Greenbeard . \n\"It's obviously not perfect,\" Thoutt told Sam Hill over at Motherboard . \"It isn't building a long-term story and the grammar isn't perfect. But the network is able to learn the basics of the English language and structure of George R.R. Martin's style on its own.\" \nNeural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that are inspired by the human brain's ability to not just memorize and follow instructions, but actually learn from past experiences. \nA recurrent neural network is a specific subclass, which works best when it comes to processing long sequences of data, such as lengthy text from five previous books. \nIn theory, Thoutt's algorithm should be able to create a true sequel to Martin's existing work, based off things that have already happened in the novels. \nBut in practice, the writing is clumsy and, most of the time, nonsensical. And it also references characters that have already died : \nIt made Ned better stop until the fire was falling, standing beneath the arch of a shattered still distant field where the shadow tower paid the camp behind. \nStill, some of the lines sound fairly prophetic: \n\"Arya saw Jon holding spears. \"Your grace,\" he said to an urgent maid, afraid. \"The crow's eye would join you. \n\"A perfect model would take everything that has happened in the books into account and not write about characters being alive when they died two books ago,\" Thoutt told Motherboard . \n\"The reality, though, is that the model isn't good enough to do that. If the model were that good authors might be in trouble ... but it makes a lot of mistakes because the technology to train a perfect text generator that can remember complex plots over millions of words doesn't exist yet.\" \nOne of the main limitations here is the fact that the books just don't contain enough data for an algorithm. \nAlthough anyone who's read them will testify that they're pretty damn long, they actually represent quite a small data set for a neural network to learn from. \nBut at the same time they contain a whole lot of unique words, nouns, and adjectives which aren't reused, which makes it very hard for the neural network to learn patterns. \nThoutt told Hill that a better source would be a book 100 times longer, but with the level of vocabulary of a children's book. Of course, though, that would defeat the purpose of the series we all know and love. \nStill, these five, clumsy chapters are the best we've got while we sit around waiting for Martin to finally finish The Winds of Winter , or HBO to release the final season (our money's on the latter happening first). \nSo for now we're going to pore over them for any clues as to what's going to happen next - who knows, maybe the algorithm has some ideas about how to take down an ice dragon...

      "title": "13 everyone is going to love about iOS 11 |",
      "text": "Apple's newest operating system for iPhones and iPads, iOS 11, finally launches this month. We'll learn the official release date for iOS 11 at Apple's big event on September 12; Apple calls its newest iOS \"a giant step for iPhone\" and \"a monumental leap for iPad.\"\nHere are 13 things everyone will love in the next big iPhone and iPad update:\n1. Live Photos will be much better. \nNow you can make your live photos into GIFs, which you can make bounce back and forth. Also, you can finally choose which still frame of the Live Photo is the main image, making it easier to find the perfect moment to share on social media.\n2. You’ll be able to store way more photos and videos on your phone. \nApple is changing the compression formats in iOS 11, which will allow you to store more photos and videos on your phone. Apple says you'll be able to save twice as many photos and videos on your device than in iOS 10.\n3. The App Store is getting a much-needed face-lift. \n\nApple is finally bringing the design language it established for newer apps like Music and News to the App Store itself.\nNot only did Apple make the App Store look cleaner, with better, bolder text, it also changed its organization. Now everyone will have a personalized \"Today\" tab to highlight unique apps and games.\nAnd speaking of games, Apple has finally dedicated a full tab of the App Store to games, making new or notable ones much easier to find.\n4. The Messages app is getting cleaned up. \nIt felt like mayhem when Apple added the app drawer to its Messages app. Suddenly, you could add stickers and GIFs and all sorts of buttons and visuals to your messages, but all the new options weren't easy to find and were somewhat overwhelming. Apple redesigned the app drawer in Messages for iOS 11, making it much easier to browse all the various stickers and emojis at your disposal.\n5. Siri sounds more natural and can translate for you. \n\nApple says Siri is going to get much more advanced through machine learning and artificial intelligence — it's unclear whether these changes would make Siri better to use, but at the very least, Apple has made Siri sound a bit less robotic and more natural, a bit like Amazon's Alexa assistant.\nAnd Apple is also testing a cool translation feature for Siri, where if you ask the assistant to say a certain phrase in a different language, like Chinese or Italian, it will speak on your behalf in the desired language.\n6. The iPhone keyboard is getting smarter. \nA signature feature of Google Now is finally coming to the iOS ecosystem: When you type in iOS 11, the keyboard will suggest words you may have recently viewed on your phone — from your Messages app, for example, or Safari. So when your friend texts you the name of a restaurant, it may be one of the first suggestions when you start searching for that restaurant on the web.\nAlso, you'll be able to use the keyboard with one hand — just hold the emoji key and select one-handed typing to move all the keys closer to your thumb.\n7. Apple is finally letting you manage your Control Center. \nThe Control Center was perhaps the most useful feature of iOS 7, released in 2013. By swiping up from the bottom of your screen, you could access a variety of shortcuts and buttons. Four years later, you'll finally be able to choose what those shortcuts and buttons are.\n8. Notifications are getting simplified. \n\nIn iOS 11, all your notifications — both recent and missed — are in one place, with no separate tabs. Just pull down from the top of the screen to see everything at once.\n9. There's a new feature that could actually save your life. \nDistracted driving is a real, deadly problem. Apple has added a clever feature that triggers Do Not Disturb mode when the iPhone is in the car to hide notifications for texts, calls, and other apps while you're driving. The feature can even notify people that you're driving and will contact them soon.\n10. Apple Maps are better, indoors and out. \nApple is adding indoor maps for hundreds of airports and shopping centers around the world, making it much easier to navigate your local mall.\nAnd speaking of navigation, Apple has finally added lane guidance to Apple Maps for more precise turn-by-turn directions.\n11. Setting up a new iPhone or iPad is much easier. \nIf you just bought a new iPhone or iPad, you can hold it close to an iOS device you already own to magically import all your settings, preferences and iCloud Keychain passwords. It helps you start using that brand-new device much more quickly than before.\n12. The volume box is moving out of your way. \nWhen you change the volume on your iPhone or iPad, a translucent box pops up in the middle of the screen. It's a bit annoying, so Apple is redesigning the volume box in iOS 11. Here's how it'll look:\n\nMuch better.\n13. You can instantly share Wi-Fi passwords. \nSoon, you'll no longer need to save your Wi-Fi password on a wrinkled piece of paper in a drawer somewhere. In iOS 11, if you need a Wi-Fi password for a given network, just find someone who is already using it and hold your device near theirs to transfer the password instantly.\nRead more: \n• This chart is easy to interpret: It says we're screwed \n• How Uber became the world's most valuable startup \n• These 4 things could trigger the next crisis in Europe \nRead the original article on Business Insider UK . © 2016.

      "text": "Customers shop for produce during the grand opening of a Whole Foods Market 365 location in Santa Monica, Calif., earlier this month. (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg) Amazon announced Thursday that its acquisition of Whole Foods will be completed on Monday — and customers will see changes immediately.\nFirst: There will be an immediate price slash on certain products, which the news release lists in weirdly specific detail, “like whole trade bananas, organic avocados, organic large brown eggs, organic responsibly-farmed salmon and tilapia, organic baby kale and baby lettuce, animal-welfare-rated 85 percent lean ground beef, creamy and crunchy almond butter, organic gala and Fuji apples, organic rotisserie chicken, 365 Everyday Value organic butter, and much more.” The lower prices will begin on Aug. 28. (Disclosure: The Washington Post and Amazon share an owner, Jeffrey P. Bezos, but no, we don’t get an employee discount on avocados.)\n“We’re determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone. Everybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality — we will lower prices without compromising Whole Foods Market’s long-held commitment to the highest standards,” said Jeff Wilke, chief executive of AmazonWorldwide Consumer, in a news release detailing the changes. \n[ Drone-delivered kale and 5 more things we might see at Amazon-owned Whole Foods ] \nThat means the days of “Whole Paycheck” are over. Whole Foods was maligned for years for its high prices — this reporter recalls once arriving at the cash register shocked to discover that three apples would cost her nearly $7 — which it has tried to address over its history. It introduced its own generic brand, distributed digital coupons, and launched lower-price spinoff stores in select markets. But still, it could never shake its reputation as a grocery store for rich people who are willing to shell out precious dollars for asparagus water and ornamental kale .\nThe Amazon acquisition could do more to eliminate that old nickname more than any of the store’s previous measures. It’s also a move that many — including The Post — predicted would come swiftly . And it’s just the first step: Soon after that, Amazon will integrate Amazon Prime as a customer rewards program for Whole Foods shoppers, and Prime members will get extra discounts and offers. Whole Foods’s private-label brands will soon be available for purchase online through Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry.\nAnd eventually, mirroring another prediction of Amazon-watchers, Whole Foods will offer Amazon Lockers in stores for customers to stop by and pick up Amazon purchases — and probably buy some groceries while they’re at it. As online grocery shopping grows, it’s an immediate answer to Amazon’s “ last mile ” delivery problem — shorthand for the idea that, the closer you get to a product’s final destination, the more challenges you have in delivering it. Whole Foods stores give Amazon refrigerated distribution centers close to where people live, which “adds to Amazon’s cachet and eases concerns of customers that their perishable food comes from two to three miles from their homes where a Whole Foods is located, instead of an Amazon distribution center that could be farther afield,” wrote Michelle Lodge for the Street. “Freshness counts.”\n[ Alice Waters wants Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to ‘make a difference’ with Whole Foods ] \nThe Amazon news release teased at other changes to come, once the companies “integrate logistics and point-of-sale and merchandising systems.” Future changes could include eliminating checkout lines, which Amazon has already done at its cashless Amazon Go store in Seattle (going cashless, while convenient for middle class customers, would also inhibit access to fresh groceries for unbanked households , which would affect more than 15 million American adults ). At that store, a combination of technology including sensors, machine learning and computer vision can detect what customers are purchasing. As long as they have the Amazon Go app, they can just walk out of the store, and their Amazon account will automatically be charged. Other Amazon innovations, such as the Amazon Dash Wand , a home bar code scanner, are likely to make their way into Whole Foods stores somehow, too.\nUntil then: Stock up on avocados. You probably couldn’t afford the Whole Foods ones until now, anyway.\nMore from Food : \nAmazon’s takeover of Whole Foods begins Monday — and you’ll see lower prices right away \nCorn on the cob is simple food. Why are there so many gadgets to help us eat it? \nA billionaire-owned restaurant charged a ‘minimum wage’ fee. Outrage ensued. \nMillennial pink took over your Instagram feed. Now it’s coming for your food.",

      "text": "Russia Sees Artificial Intelligence as Key to World Domination share See comments Print \nThe digital arms race between the United States and Russia appears to be accelerating, fueled in part by new comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nPutin, speaking to a group of Russian students Friday, called artificial intelligence \"not only Russia's future\" but \"the future of the whole of mankind.\" \n\"The one who becomes the leader in this sphere will be the ruler of the world,\" he said. \"There are colossal opportunities and threats that are difficult to predict now.\" \nDigital domain \nTop U.S. intelligence officials have been warning of a \"perpetual contest\" between the United States and Russia, with much of it playing out in the digital domain. \nThe Defense Intelligence Agency in particular has sought to maximize its ability to make use of artificial intelligence, or AI, reaching out to private industry and academia to help maintain the U.S. advantage. \nRussia and China are seen as key competitors in the digital space and have been working on how to apply technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, to their war-fighting doctrines. FILE - Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart discusses artificial intelligence and machine learning at the DIA Industry Day presentations, Aug. 2, 2017, at DIA headquarters in Washington. (Courtesy DIA) \n\"They've got their heads wrapped around the idea that 21st century warfare is as much cognitive as it is kinetic,\" outgoing DIA Director Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart told a small group of reporters from VOA and other organizations last month. \nTop officials, both in government and in the private sector, have long been willing to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence and other technological advances. \nBut some analysts see Putin's willingness to address the issue publicly as telling. \n\"[It's] rare that you have a head of state discussing these issues,\" said Frank Cilluffo, director of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University. \"He is sending a message.\" \nAnd Cilluffo hopes the U.S. is paying attention. \n\"A big space race is on, and it's a race we can't afford to lose,\" he said. \nUS maintains advantage \nMany experts say the U.S. still maintains an advantage over Russia in artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Still, as Russia, China and other countries seek additional breakthroughs in how to apply such technology, the stakes are high. \n\"It completely changes the game of warfare,\" said David Kennedy, who served with the U.S. National Security Agency and with the Marine Corps' electronic warfare unit. \n\"It's no longer going to be about who has the most bombs or who has the better bombs,\" he said. \"It's going to be who can apply these principles to respond faster to fight a war and win a war.\" \nAnd Kennedy, now chief executive officer at TrustedSec, an information technology security consulting firm, sees Russia gaining. Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with students in Yaroslavl, Russia, Sept. 1, 2017. Putin said the development of artificial intelligence raises \"colossal opportunities and threats that are difficult to predict now.\" \n\"They explore all options, and they have a substantial budget for it,\" he said, noting that Moscow may have an advantage in how to apply the technology since it is willing to sidestep privacy and ethical concerns that the U.S. and even China have tried to address. \nChina, too, is making significant gains. But unlike Russia, China has focused more on quantum computing, launching a quantum satellite into space last year. \nQuantum computing uses a quirk of physics that allows subatomic particles to simultaneously exist in two different states. As a result, a computer is then able to skip through much of the elaborate mathematical computations necessary to solve complex problems. \nIt is seen as a potentially game-changing tool for intelligence agencies, enabling them to hack encrypted messages from their adversaries while their own communications would be \"hackproof,\" if the technology can be perfected. \n\"The Chinese have one of the most powerful quantum encryption capabilities in the world,\" DIA's Stewart cautioned last month. \"Whoever wins this space wins the game.\" ",

      "text": " A takedown notice issued by YouTube on a video of the Syrian conflict. Credit YouTube In an effort to purge extremist propaganda from its platform, YouTube has inadvertently removed thousands of videos that could be used to document atrocities in Syria, potentially jeopardizing future war crimes prosecutions, observers and rights advocates say.\n“When the conflict in Syria started, independent media broke down and Syrians themselves have taken to YouTube to post news of the conflict,” said Chris Woods, the director of Airwars , a London-based organization that tracks international airstrikes and their effect on civilians. “What’s disappearing in front of our eyes is the history of this terrible war.”\nAn unspecified number of individual videos and some YouTube channels were deleted in recent weeks after the company put in place new technology to automatically flag and remove content that potentially breached its guidelines. Some videos were reinstated after their creators alerted YouTube.\nThe company previously relied on its users and a network of trusted monitors to report inappropriate material, which was then prioritized by an algorithm before being subjected to human review.\n The new technology applies “machine learning” to identify and prioritize extremist videos for review. While most still undergo a human review before being removed, a YouTube spokeswoman said the technology might automatically remove videos and issue warnings to the content’s creators.\n The system was designed to identify videos posted by extremists groups, especially the Islamic State and its sympathizers, but any content from Syria and conflict zones where extremists operate risks being caught in YouTube’s net.\n“There are probably 200 or so civil-society organizations working on Syria alone,” said Keith Hiatt, a vice president of Benetech, which provides tools for human rights investigations, and a board member of the International Criminal Court’s technology advisory group. “Some have risked their lives, others have given their lives to document the atrocities and document human rights violations.”\nIf YouTube takes these videos down, Mr. Hiatt said, the platform risks losing “the richest source of information about human rights violations in closed societies.”\nOrganizations that use such videos in their research regularly download copies and share them among themselves, but journalists and smaller groups do not have the same technical resources and therefore rely on YouTube to host the videos.\nOne group that monitors these videos is the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, a legal team established by th e United Nations to collect and preserve evidence of crimes for use by courts and international tribunals.\n“The I.I.I.M. will need to draw on social media and open source information when it’s building cases that it will pass to prosecutorial teams,” Mr. Hiatt said. “Things just got a lot harder now the videos that were on YouTube are no longer around.”\nMore than 6,000 videos documenting the Syrian conflict since 2014 were temporarily removed when YouTube shuttered the channel of the Qasioun News Agency , an activist media group with dozens of correspondents in Syria.\n “Around one month ago we received strikes against all our channels — English, Kurdish and Arabic,” Talal Kharrat, a manager with the agency, said in an interview. “The Arabic channel had our most subscribers and was deleted completely.”\nResidents of Khan Sheikhon in Idlib province, Syria, respond to chemical attacks by the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Video by Qasioun News Agency Airwars also had around a dozen of its videos temporarily removed, and at least five other channels belonging to Syrian opposition groups and the Syrian Ministry of Defense were deleted.\n“Out of nowhere we received emails in quick succession that said that individual archived videos had been deemed to breach terms and conditions,” Mr. Woods of Airwars said. “We were issued a formal warning and told if we had two more strikes our channel would be taken down.”\nYouTube’s community guidelines stipulate that a channel can be removed for three violations of the platform’s guidelines in a three-month period. The speed at which the new system is analyzing and issuing warnings on previously posted videos appears to be one reason some channels are being taken down without advance notice.\n“From a warning to a channel being shut down happens in a short journey,” Mr. Woods said.\nWhile the new system appears to be correctly identifying graphic content like execution videos and Islamic State propaganda, it is mislabeling some videos. Three of the Airwars videos removed from its YouTube channel were aerial videos of airstrikes released by the Pentagon showing no graphic content.\nAn Aug. 19, 2015, airstrike near Ar-Rutbah, Iraq, by the American-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants. Video by CENTCOM and hosted by Airwars.org Mr. Kharrat of the Qasioun News Agency said one of its videos had been cited for “spreading violence,” even though it simply documented clashes between Syrian government forces and opposition groups.\nEliot Higgins, a journalist who founded the investigative website Bellingcat, said he had received an email warning about a video he uploaded in 2013, and a second notice for an edited video of the Islamic State’s killing of the journalist James Foley that was not available publicly.\nWith 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, a spokeswoman for the company said the new filtering technology was designed for scale and would improve with time. When it is brought to the site’s attention that a video or channel has been removed mistakenly, she said, YouTube acts quickly to reinstate it.\nOrganizations worried that their content might be taken down are advised to provide context about the events in the online summary and metadata tags, and to be explicit about their intent in publishing these videos.",

      "text": "AI uses bitcoin trail to find and help sex-trafficking victims Follow the money APA-PictureDesk GmbH/REX/Shutterstock By Timothy Revell \nAfter Kubiiki Pride’s 13-year-old daughter disappeared , it took 270 days for her mother to find her. When she did, it was as an escort available to be rented out on an online classified web site. Her daughter had been drugged and beaten into compliance by a sex trafficker. \nTo find her, Pride had to trawl through hundreds of advertisements on Backpage.com, a site that in 2012, the last date for which stats are available, was hosting more than 70 per cent of the US market for online sex ads. When it comes to identifying signs of human trafficking in online sex adverts, the task for police is often no easier. Thousands of sex-related classifieds are posted every week. Some are legal posts. Other people, like Pride’s daughter, are forced to do it. Working out which ads involve foul play is a laborious task. \nHowever, the task is being automated using a strange alliance of artificial intelligence and bitcoin . Advertisement Learn about the future of AI: Join DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis at New Scientist Live \n“The internet has facilitated a lot of methods that traffickers can take advantage of. They can easily reach big audiences and generate a lot of content without having to reveal themselves,” says Rebecca Portnoff at the University of California, Berkeley. \nBut a new tool developed by Portnoff and her colleagues can ferret traffickers out. It uses machine learning to spot common patterns in suspicious ads , and then uses publicly available information from the payment method used to pay for them – bitcoin – to help identify who placed them. The digital trail \nThe tool will help not only the investigation and intervention of potential traffickers, “but also to support prosecution efforts in an arena where money moves with rapidity across financial instruments and disappears from the evidence trail”, says Carrie Pemberton Ford at the Cambridge Centre for Applied Research in Human Trafficking . \nThere are about 4.5 million people who have been forced into sexual exploitation . In the US, many of them end up advertised on Backpage, the second biggest classified ad listing site. People list everything from events to furniture there, but it has also become associated with sex ads and sex trafficking – so much so that the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has said that the majority of child sex trafficking cases referred to them involve ads on Backpage. \nNormally, the tell-tale sign that an advert involves trafficking is that the person behind it is responsible for many other adverts across the site. However, this is difficult to spot, as adverts mention the people being trafficked, not the traffickers. \nTo identify the authors of online sex ads, Portnoff’s tool looks at the style in which ads are written. Artificial intelligence trained on thousands of different adverts highlights when similar styles have been used, and clusters together likely candidates for further investigation. \nThe second step comes via the payment method. Credit card companies stopped the use of their services on Backpage in 2015, leaving bitcoin as the only way to paying for adverts. \nEvery transaction made using bitcoin is logged on a publicly available ledger called the blockchain . It doesn’t store identities, but every user has an associated wallet that is recorded alongside the transaction. The AI tool searches the blockchain to identify the wallet that corresponds to each advert. Evidence for the prosecution \nIt is also easy to see when each ad was posted. “We look at cost of the ad and the timestamp, then connect the ad to a specific person or group. This means the police then have a pretty good candidate for further investigation,” says Portnoff. \nOnce the police know which ads are of dubious origin, they can call the numbers on them in the knowledge that they might well be linked to crime. “Narrowing down from the hundreds of thousands of ads online will be very useful for law enforcement officers who have to read through so many ads during an investigation,” says Portnoff. \nDuring a four-week period, the research team tried out their tool on 10,000 adverts. It correctly identified about 90 per cent of adverts that had the same author, with a false positive rate of only 1 per cent. One of the bitcoin wallets they tracked down was responsible for $150,000 worth of sex adverts, possible evidence of an exploitation ring. \nBackpage has not yet responded to New Scientist ’s requests for comment. \nThe team is working with a number of different police forces and NGOs with the hope of using the tool in real investigations soon. The work was presented at the Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining in Canada this month. \nThe trafficker who kidnapped Kubiiki Pride’s daughter was eventually caught and sentenced to five years in prison. Successfully prosecutions like that are rare, but with Portnoff’s new tool that could soon change. \nMore on these topics: ",

      "text": "A prototype \"pen\" technology aims to give cancer surgeons a better sense of whether they've removed all of a tumour while in the operating room.\n\nThe new approach strives to answer a patient's question after surgeons remove a tumour: \"Did you get it all?\"\nTo say yes confidently, doctors often send a sample of the tissue in question to a pathologist to freeze, check and test under a microscope. It's the gold standard for accuracy, but takes at least 30 minutes per sample. As the clock ticks, the patient remains under anesthesia.\nCancer surgeons estimate that in up to 20 per cent of some operations, traces of tumour remain at the margin or edges of where they've cut, which can lead to repeated surgeries or recurrence of cancer.\nIn this week's issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine , U.S. researchers describe an experimental pen-like tool for surgeons that quickly draws samples through a tube to test for traces of cancerous tissue in the OR, with results within 10 seconds.\nThe technology could achieve the goals of more precise, quicker and safer surgery, said study co-author Dr. James Suliburk, chief of endocrine surgery at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\"It allows us in real time to test tissue from the operative field as we actually operate and ensure that we've resected the tumour to appropriate surgical margins,\" Suliburk said.\nIn a series of experiments, investigators in Texas tested the pen-sized prototype tip that's connected to a conventional mass spectrometer, which varies from the size of a laser printer to a fridge.\nIn validation tests on samples taken from 253 people with known lung, ovary, thyroid or breast tumours from a tissue bank, the device was 96 per cent accurate in identifying cancers, the team said. \nGiant leaps forward The researchers also used what they call the \"MasSpec Pen\" to reliably identify breast tumours in mice. They hope to use it in surgery on human patients early in 2018 followed by clinical trials.\n\"Usually we take small step forwards and along the way we take several steps back,\" Suliburk said. \"Because of our multidisciplinary research team … we've been able to take giant leaps forward with only small steps backwards. And that's something that in modern-day medical research seldom happens.\"\nCancer tissue sniffed out with smart surgical knife Needless breast cancer imaging common in Ontario — study Suliburk envisions the technology eliminating the need to send out tissue to be analyzed under the microscope. \nResearchers say the MasSpec Pen can non-destructively analyze human tissue samples to identify cancer. (University of Texas at Austin)\n\nLivia Schiavinato Eberlin, an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin, envisioned the technology. Co-author and campus colleague Thomas Milner, a professor of biomedical engineering, worked with her team to put together a prototype that could be held against a patient's tissue.\nIt's biocompatible, since it just takes water deposits from the surface of the tissue. Then samples are transported through special tubing to the mass spectrometer, said Milner.\nDeciphering tumour fingerprints Next, machine learning software analyzes the \"fingerprint\" of metabolites from the sample to find predictably higher concentrations within a tumour. In seconds, the surgical team sees the final result on a screen displaying \"cancer\" or \"normal.\" \n\"Because the imaging and tools are so good, these treatments can be done predictably and reliably,\" Milner said.\nThere's a whole fleet of similar  technologies coming to the operating room. For instance, the iKnife and its accompanying mass spectrometer samples the sharp-smelling smoke that rises when surgeons heat tissue as they cut. Other experimental modes are based on ultrasound or light.\nConventional pathology will remain paramount until it's proven that the molecular fingerprint from samples taken from next to a tumour are truly a cancerous cell, cautioned Dr. John Rudan, head of surgery at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. He was not involved in the study.\n'A lot of promise' for nanorobots to treat breast cancer, says Montreal doctor New laser method could help neurosurgeons get at hard-to-reach tumours \"How does the clinician react to that area that happens to light up in the tissue adjacent to where you think the tumour is? We don't know what the answer is going to be yet. It's going to take a while for us to actually understand that.\"\nRudan sees how the MasSpec Pen could help surgeons to determine if surgical margins are clear. He's also aware of limitations on what it could accomplish. For instance, tumours are three-dimensional and need to be scanned all over, yet the tool itself lacks depth perception.\n\"I see this as a very interesting type of technology that will probably have a place in surgical oncology,\" said Rudan, who holds the university's Britton Smith Chair in surgery.\nAt Queen's, Rudan and his colleagues are using an image-guided tool  on frozen breast cancer specimens. Part of the challenge is that breast tissue moves between the time when it's sampled, removed and analyzed. Without tracking technologies, surgeons can be working blind when they return to a particular spot.\nThe MasSpec Pen prototype hasn't been used in a real surgery. It could take years to determine if it's valid, cost-effective and ultimately improves survival rates.",

      "text": "Shutterstock\nApple's newest operating system for iPhones and iPads, iOS 11, finally launches this month. We'll learn the official release date for iOS 11 at Apple's big event on September 12; Apple calls its newest iOS \"a giant step for iPhone\" and \"a monumental leap for iPad.\"\nHere are 13 things everyone will love in the next big iPhone and iPad update:\n 1. Live Photos will be much better. Apple Now you can make your live photos into GIFs, which you can make bounce back and forth. Also, you can finally choose which still frame of the Live Photo is the main image, making it easier to find the perfect moment to share on social media.\n2. You’ll be able to store way more photos and videos on your phone. Apple Apple is changing the compression formats in iOS 11, which will allow you to store more photos and videos on your phone. Apple says you'll be able to save twice as many photos and videos on your device than in iOS 10.\n3. The App Store is getting a much-needed face-lift. Business Insider Apple is finally bringing the design language it established for newer apps like Music and News to the App Store itself.\nNot only did Apple make the App Store look cleaner, with better, bolder text, it also changed its organization. Now everyone will have a personalized \"Today\" tab to highlight unique apps and games.\nAnd speaking of games, Apple has finally dedicated a full tab of the App Store to games, making new or notable ones much easier to find.\n4. The Messages app is getting cleaned up. Apple It felt like mayhem when Apple added the app drawer to its Messages app. Suddenly, you could add stickers and GIFs and all sorts of buttons and visuals to your messages, but all the new options weren't easy to find and were somewhat overwhelming. Apple redesigned the app drawer in Messages for iOS 11, making it much easier to browse all the various stickers and emojis at your disposal.\n5. Siri sounds more natural and can translate for you. Screenshot Apple says Siri is going to get much more advanced through machine learning and artificial intelligence — it's unclear whether these changes would make Siri better to use, but at the very least, Apple has made Siri sound a bit less robotic and more natural, a bit like Amazon's Alexa assistant.\nAnd Apple is also testing a cool translation feature for Siri, where if you ask the assistant to say a certain phrase in a different language, like Chinese or Italian, it will speak on your behalf in the desired language.\n6. The iPhone keyboard is getting smarter. Apple A signature feature of Google Now is finally coming to the iOS ecosystem: When you type in iOS 11, the keyboard will suggest words you may have recently viewed on your phone — from your Messages app, for example, or Safari. So when your friend texts you the name of a restaurant, it may be one of the first suggestions when you start searching for that restaurant on the web.\nAlso, you'll be able to use the keyboard with one hand — just hold the emoji key and select one-handed typing to move all the keys closer to your thumb.\n7. Apple is finally letting you manage your Control Center. Apple The Control Center was perhaps the most useful feature of iOS 7, released in 2013. By swiping up from the bottom of your screen, you could access a variety of shortcuts and buttons. Four years later, you'll finally be able to choose what those shortcuts and buttons are.\n8. Notifications are getting simplified. Apple In iOS 11, all your notifications — both recent and missed — are in one place, with no separate tabs. Just pull down from the top of the screen to see everything at once.\n9. There's a new feature that could actually save your life. Apple Distracted driving is a real, deadly problem. Apple has added a clever feature that triggers Do Not Disturb mode when the iPhone is in the car to hide notifications for texts, calls, and other apps while you're driving. The feature can even notify people that you're driving and will contact them soon.\n10. Apple Maps are better, indoors and out. Apple Apple is adding indoor maps for hundreds of airports and shopping centers around the world, making it much easier to navigate your local mall.\nAnd speaking of navigation, Apple has finally added lane guidance to Apple Maps for more precise turn-by-turn directions.\n11. Setting up a new iPhone or iPad is much easier. Apple If you just bought a new iPhone or iPad, you can hold it close to an iOS device you already own to magically import all your settings, preferences and iCloud Keychain passwords. It helps you start using that brand-new device much more quickly than before.\n12. The volume box is moving out of your way. Twitter When you change the volume on your iPhone or iPad, a translucent box pops up in the middle of the screen. It's a bit annoying, so Apple is redesigning the volume box in iOS 11. Here's how it'll look:\nMuch better.\n13. You can instantly share Wi-Fi passwords. Chris Maddern Soon, you'll no longer need to save your Wi-Fi password on a wrinkled piece of paper in a drawer somewhere. In iOS 11, if you need a Wi-Fi password for a given network, just find someone who is already using it and hold your device near theirs to transfer the password instantly.\nEXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:\n30 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Musk ‘lines up $100m’ to fund Neuralink brain-computer interface Published time: 27 Aug, 2017 06:50 Edited time: 27 Aug, 2017 12:59 Get short URL Experiment with Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) in neuroscience laboratory © Erik Tham / Getty Images Elon Musk could be preparing to invest $100 million of his own money to fund Neuralink, the start-up the billionaire tycoon hopes will one day produce technology capable of connecting the human brain to a computer, and save us from AI overtake. \nA filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) confirms that Neuralink already has $27 million in funding, and Musk took to Twitter Friday to shoot down suggestions that the company was looking for outside investors. Neuralink is not raising money — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 25, 2017 It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 25, 2017 \nWhile Musk himself has been equivocal about the filing, Bloomberg stated that he “has taken steps to sell as much as $100 million in stock to fund the development.” \nNeuralink remains a mystery to observers of the tech industry. The company’s website simply states that it is “developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers.” \nREAD MORE: Elon Musk’s Neuralink could represent next stage of human evolution \nIn April, the blog ‘Wait But Why’ published a colossal blog post about the venture using stick-figure illustrations to explain Musk’s plan to merge the human brain with AI using brain implants. \nWriter and cartoonist Tim Urban spent six weeks researching the idea, a process that involved meeting and interviewing Musk. It's finally here: the full story on Neuralink. I knew the future would be nuts but this is a whole other level. https://t.co/4I44hFJzFC pic.twitter.com/YVA6dLH8uY — Tim Urban (@waitbutwhy) April 20, 2017 \nThe billionaire investor, who is also the founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, believes the technology is crucial to mankind’s survival in the face of machine-learning. \nLast month, Musk sparked a debate about the future of AI after telling the US National Governors’ Association in Rhode Island that we could be facing a future in which intelligent machines destroy mankind. If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. pic.twitter.com/2z0tiid0lc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2017 \n“AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs or bad food were not. They were harmful to a set of individuals in society of course, but they were not harmful to society as a whole,” Musk told Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval.",

      "text": "Climate-Change Research Is Getting a Big Dose of AI \nLocal Motors and IBM started collaborating on Olli in early 2016 and produced a first iteration of the bus in June 2016. That vehicle is currently in trials in Germany and Switzerland. It is the next—second—generation of Olli that will include assistive technologies. That version, which the companies call “Accessible Olli,” will be manufactured starting in 2018, and will retain Watson as a tool for communicating with passengers and add additional Watson features. \nLocal Motors and IBM are still testing technologies, but have already identified some capabilities they are likely to add. Future Ollis, for example, might direct visually impaired passengers to empty seats using machine vision to identify open spots, and audio cues and a mobile app to direct the passenger. Olli could also guide passengers via a special type of haptic feedback that uses ultrasound to project sensations through the air. An array of haptic sensors could be designed into every seat, and when people walk down the aisle they would feel a vibration on their hand or arm to alert them that they were at an empty seat, explains Drew LaHart, the program director for IBM’s accessibility division . \nFor deaf people, the buses could employ machine vision and augmented reality to read and speak sign language via onboard screens or passengers’ smartphones. LaHart says that Olli could be trained to recognize sign language using machine learning and Watson’s image recognition capabilities. If the bus were equipped with AR technology, it might be able to respond via a hologram of a person signing. \nMachine vision could also enable Olli to recognize passengers waiting at bus stops who have walkers and wheelchairs. The bus would then activate an automated ramp to help them board and then deploy equipment that would secure their assistive devices, locking a wheelchair into place, for example. What type of assistive technology would you include in a self-driving bus for disabled people? Tell us in the comments. \nAnother potential Olli technology combines machine vision and sensors to detect when passengers leave items under their seats and issues alerts so the possessions can be retrieved, a feature meant to benefit people with age-related dementia and other cognitive disabilities. \nThis would all be a significant improvement over the typical bus accommodations of today, which are limited to wheelchair ramps and lifts and audible and visual bus route updates. Local Motors, IBM, and the CTA Foundation , the charitable arm of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group for the consumer electronics industry, and a partner in Accessible Olli, have spent the past three months soliciting ideas from disability rights organizations and retirement communities, among others. Manser, who works for IBM Accessibility, has organized a workshop with blindness organizations and public transit agencies and attended an MIT assistive technologies hackathon in March to explain the challenges he encounters on public transportation. \nLocal Motors plans to keep soliciting public input for several more months. In July, it will devise an engineering plan for the new version of Olli, select suppliers, and calculate the cost of fabricating the bus. It aims to sell the vehicle for about $250,000 and will also offer a leasing-subscription service that would cost $10,000 to $12,000 a month and include hardware upgrades. Because Olli is mostly manufactured on-demand, through 3-D printing, its design can be tweaked quickly in response to user feedback, says O’Connell. \nThe company expects public transportation operators will be its main customers and hopes that cities will buy the buses to fill in gaps in their regular transit systems and not just as paratransit vehicles for disabled people. \nFor those with disabilities, though, Olli could be a big improvement over the current options. Door-to-door paratransit service tends to be slow, has to be scheduled ahead of time, and is only available to people who qualify for it, says Henry Claypool, who is the policy director of the Community Living Policy Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and a wheelchair user. “It’s much more reliable to be able to get on and off a bus at the same place and have a predictable schedule, especially if the bus has this type of assistive technology,” he says. \nOlli offers a way to address important limitations of public bus and train systems as well, says Susan Henderson, the executive director of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund . The Americans with Disabilities Act mandates only that “key” train and subway stations be accessible, which means that people with wheelchairs, walkers, and scooters often have to travel several stops out of their way to get home or to a destination, says Henderson. “If I still had 10 blocks to go after getting off at my local station, having an Olli rolling around my neighborhood would make a big difference,” she says.

      "title": "Anti-fake news startup Factmata has raised seed funding from Mark Cuban and others - Business Insider",
      "text": "print \nFactmata CEO Dhruv Ghulati and chief technology officer Robert Stojnic. Factmata Factmata is a British startup trying to tackle the growing problem of fake news and misinformation, with the help of artificial intelligence. It has raised a seed round from high-profile US investors including billionaire Mark Cuban, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and Brightmail founder Sunil Paul. CEO Dhruv Ghulati said there's demand for a service that scores news articles for quality and adds context. \nMost investors won't even consider a startup pitch unless they know the founders or have had a \"warm intro\" to them. \nBut 25-year-old Dhruv Gulati may be the exception to the rule, after he emailed billionaire investor Mark Cuban without any introduction to pitch his anti-fake-news startup Factmata — and persuaded Cuban to invest. \nCuban has now participated in its seed round, along with Zynga founder Mark Pincus and Brightmail founder Sunil Paul. \n\"I had a key list of people I wanted to have on board,\" Ghulati told Business Insider, adding that Cuban was among them. \"Every single investor we have has some element of being extremely strategic and important for the business. It was about making that clear to the investor, as opposed to just, 'Why am I randomly emailing you?'\" \nFactmata wants to use artificial intelligence to tackle the proliferation of fake and misleading news. The startup aims to be a cross between Wikipedia and Quora, with a community of users fact-checking or marking news articles for quality with the help of AI. Those users may include everyday internet users but also journalists. \nThe startup is building its first product for launch next year: a news aggregator designed to show a quality score and offer extra links for context. Eventually, Factmata may offer its underlying technology to public-relations firms, media outlets, and other organisations for a fee. \nGhulati's thesis is that journalism's prevalent ad-funded model has encouraged news outlets to pursue eyeballs through sensationalism and misinformation. The rise of that model online coincides with the decline of the subeditor in newsrooms , the people who rigorously check articles before they are published. \nAll of this, he said, has helped contribute to waning trust in the news media — which in turn may have led to the rise of fake news. \nA journalist may be skeptical that any kind of quality-checking on articles can be outsourced to machine learning. But Ghulati said it was about building tools to assist, not replace, the fact-checking process. \nHe said: \"Not all of it can be done with machine learning. Hopefully there'll also be input gathered from a big community of users, the Wikipedia model. That's what we're aiming for, a credibility score on information.\" \nThe team has a strong pedigree. Its chief technology officer, Robert Stojnic, was formerly a developer at Wikipedia, building out the platform's search function. And Ghulati's cofounders are two machine-learning specialists: UCL researcher Sebastian Riedel and UCL research associate Andreas Vlachos. \n\"I was impressed by the team's pedigree, technical talent, and sheer drive to solve this problem,\" Cuban said in a statement. \n\"If we want to solve fake news, thinking about it at web scale via artificial intelligence and automation is the only way. And being outside the media or fact checking world allows them to see the problem in a different way. Factmata is a group of entrepreneurs trying to solve a challenging problem with an amazing mission.\" \nFactmata isn't the only project trying to tackle fake news. Facebook has added features designed to alert people to misinformation , while Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales launched the community-powered news outlet Wikitribune earlier this year . \nGhulati is sceptical that Facebook can solve the fake-news problem by itself. \n\"We're a platform fully focused on quality of information,\" he said. \"With Facebook, it's not in their model, it's not what they think about. And they're ads-incentivised. Clearly there's a demand from the public to solve these problems, and whether platforms can do that to an adequate level — who knows? But we're 100% focused on it.\" ",

      "text": "Todd Bishop/ GeekWire Photo Google has bought Senosis Health, a startup that turns smartphones into medical devices and collects various health stats, reports GeekWire . TheSenosis apps can monitor lung health and hemoglobin counts, among other things, using functions on a smartphone including its accelerometer, microphone, flash and camera. For example, to measure the hemoglobin, Senosis’ app uses the phone’s flash to illuminate a user’s finger. Shwetak Patel founded the company with four others from the University of Washington and it’s not the first time his ventures have been acquired. In 2015, Sears bought Patel’s WallyHome sensor technology that detects changes in moisture, temperature, and humidity. The acquisition comes at a time when Google is investing heavily into health care technology. Last year, it launched DeepMind Health, an initiative to create a suite of apps that can help doctors identify patients at risk of complications. Google is using AI and machine learning to create tools for medical providers, and at the moment, it says most progress is being made in ophthalmology and digital pathology. The acquisition is in line with Google’s plans for its health technology arm , which aims to “dramatically improve the availability and accuracy of medical services.” Next Up In Science ",

      "text": "There is no shortage of AI and machine learning startups being born today. But one of the biggest opportunities remains in turning AI into some kind of platform that others can leverage, especially businesses.\nIn recent years a new area has been developed in relation what’s know in the tech industry as knowledge graphs, a concept which been around for quite some time, especially in relation to the semantic web. But until recently there has not been much of an attempt to democratizing the development and management of knowledge graphs.\nNow a new company, GraphPath hopes the change that. A startup created by parent company Aunken Labs, GraphPath already has a long history in AI. It’s founder, Demian Bellumio, has been building tech companies with a machine learning component for over a decade. If anyone should know how to execute this idea, he should.\nGraphPath officially comes out of the gate today with two main announcements. The first is that it’s acquiring Socialmetrix .\nThis is described as a “leader in the multi-language social analytics and listening space. GraphPath is going to use it to accelerate its deployment into enterprises across the US and Latin America. Socialmetrix received a minority investment from UK-based DMGT in 2011.\nSecondly, although the GraphPath is not disclosing how much money is has raised since its inception, it lists some globally-recognized advisors and investors on its website. Chris Boos and Antoine Blondeau, from Arago and Sentient Technologies, respectively, are two of the most well-known AI experts from Europe and the US. Also listed is Martin Varsavsky, from Prelude Fertility, Fon, Jazztel; Andrew McLaughlin, from Higher Ground Labs, betaworks and Google; and Babak Razi, from Ingenu, Ostendo and Broadcom.\nGoogle popularized knowledge graphs, with the term often discussed by Alphabet’s CEO Sundar Pichai during the investor calls, and even at the I/O Conference this past May, where he used it as an example that differentiates Google Lens, their new visual search tool.\nBut until recently, there was no attempt to have an agreed upon definition of it, so late last year, researchers at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria decided to come up with a formal definition: “A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.”\nGraphPath actually borrows this definition in its site to describe the term. But it goes a step further and presents their concept as a “Knowledge Graph-as-a-Service”, which includes a number of building blocks, including Graph Computing Framework; Web and API Access; Machine Learning Workflows; and Cloud or on Premise Deployment.\nBellumio says they developed this approach based on the team’s collective expertise on deploying large-scale graph databases, machine learning and graph analytics projects.\nGraphPath’s claims that as it is delivered as a SaaS, it enables a faster and reliable implementation when compared with in-house solutions, and clients of the platform will also have the ability to pick between cloud or on-premise solution based on compliance requirements.\nGraphPath will aim at large enterprises using big data. So for example, it could be applied to the data from cell towers and the data generated by the system when phones connect to it. From the users’ perspective, it may include their billing history, app usage, call log, roaming charges, etc. And lastly, it may also include sentiment data collected from social media networks that is generated around geo-fenced areas, such as a high-value cell tower clusters around the downtown area of a city, to compare against the network data and the user data.\nThat means you could get a list of cell towers in a region with the highest percentage of drop calls where the user sentiment is 20% worse than competitors, for instance.\n0\nSHARES Advertisement",

      "text": "‘Brains linked to computers will kill our inner freedom’ - Zizek to RT on biohacking & identity loss Published time: 15 Aug, 2017 06:24 Edited time: 15 Aug, 2017 06:39 Get short URL Slavoj Zizek © Chinafotopress / Global Look Press Humans are losing their freedoms, self-identity and free will, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek has told RT, noting that a recent biohacking experiment by a team from the University of Washington is just another sign of the dawn of a post human era. \nA team of scientists from the University of Washington successfully managed to hack into a computer using custom synthesized strands of DNA. \nIn their study , which is to be presented at 2017 USENIX Security Symposium Thursday, researchers said that it is potentially possible for a molecular code to take over machinery by exploiting weaknesses of gene sequencing software. “We designed and created a synthetic DNA strand that contained malicious computer code encoded in the bases of the DNA strand,” researchers from the Paul G Allen school of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington said ahead of their presentation. More coverage of Ney et al.'s paper, which'll be presented on Thur afternoon at #usesec17 . https://t.co/8w4fTQKl84 https://t.co/o3H1GkGIek — USENIX Security (@USENIXSecurity) August 14, 2017 \n“When this physical strand was sequenced and processed by the vulnerable program it gave remote control of the computer doing the processing. That is, we were able to remotely exploit and gain full control over a computer using adversarial synthetic DNA.” \nWhile the researchers led by Tadayoshi Kohno and Luis Ceze admit that at this point, the threat is only theoretical, Zizek noted the sinister side of this experiment. \n“The fact that is what possible to break into, to hack a computer through a DNA, means that our identity, determined by DNA is nothing more than just another computer formula,” Zizek said. Read more ‘Who will control merged human-AI digital space?’ Slavoj Zizek on Musk’s brain implant venture \n“Our life, human life, our identity is reduced to a series of formulas. So we are effectively entering some kind of post human universe where everything, our inner most identity can be reduced to a formula.” \n“I would not be afraid of this [particular experiment], that’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Zizek said, emphasizing that there are a lot of much more disturbing scientific achievements \n“What I'm afraid of is a possibility of a direct contact-link between our brain, what we are thinking, and a computer network, because there we lose our autonomy.” \nHe warned that soon computers will be able to control the human mind, misleading the individual to believe they are still in control of their thoughts and reality. Under this arrangement, Zizek argues, humans will lose their autonomy and will become indistinguishable from the machines. \n“What is much more dangerous is... if our brains will be directly linked to computers so we will lose our inner freedom. Even in the worst of Nazism… those in power could not control what you are thinking. You can have your inner thoughts... Now with a direct link between our brain and the digital network, we lose our inner freedom,” the philosopher said. \nIn order to avoid machines potentially taking over the human identity, Zizek argues that all research into artificial intelligence has to be made public so that people can decide on the discourse of machine learning. \n“Make all these procedures, and what is going on, these results as public as possible. No agency which is not transpiring to the public, neither state nor a public corporation should do this outside public knowledge and public control,” Zizek told RT. \nCorbyn’s paradoxical victory over May’s politics of scaremongering gives hope – Slavoj Zizek to RT \nOverall, the philosopher argues that humankind has entered an era of technological domination. \n“Biology as science is totally integrated into a project of technological domination, manipulation and so on. And this technological use is inscribed into how biology functions today... life itself becomes just a technological process,” Zizek said. \nBut there is still a deeper philosophic problem, which nowadays has growing practical implications, Zizek said. “Is our identity fully determined by DNA? Or are we are not just biological automats? Do we have some spiritual freedom and so on?” \n“I think if we are just our DNA. If the interaction of our DNA with environment determines us completely, then yes we should worry. But in a way, we just discovered that we never were free. We were automats [machines] also now but we did not know it. Our freedom was an illusion… So are we automats which just can be controlled or is there hope for our freedom?”",

      "text": "Android Wear 2.0 updates and latest news Update: The Moto 360 Sport is receiving the Android Wear 2.0 update now. 2017-08-21T11:00:00Z 2 days ago \nAndroid Wear 2.0 was showcased at Google I/O in May 2016 and it started rolling out to smartwatches in February. Below you will find out all you need to know about the second version of the Android Wear operating system, including when to expect the update for each manufacturer. The latest news is that the Moto 360 Sport is receiving the update now . There are 10 sorts of people: those who understand binary and those who don’t. What do you think? Android Wear 2.0 unveiled \nThe biggest release for Android Wear yet, version 2.0, brings a more refined approach from Google, narrowing down its aspirations for the technology. An Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview is available already, and in its fifth version since January 2017. Find out how you can get the Developer Preview up and running over at the Google Android Wear Developers page . \nWe gave Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview a test run with the futuristic Huawei Watch. Check out the video below to hear our thoughts and see the new version of the OS in action. \nMost notably, Android Wear 2.0 can run standalone apps, meaning the watch doesn't need to be in range of a smartphone for an app to work. This makes Android Wear more independent, striking out from the impression people have of smartwatches being expensive and unnecessary smartphone accessories. \nWith cellular support, Android Wear 2.0 lets you make calls, use OK Google, and more without relying on your phone being nearby. Not only that, the latest update to smartwatches brings support for Google Assistant, which we first saw with the release of its Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL , in addition to Android Pay. Complications, features showing data from apps, can now be shown on any watch face. / © Google \nMessaging saw an improvement through handwriting recognition, smart reply, and a swipe-enabled keyboard. Google placed many of its products at I/O under the umbrella of its machine learning expertise, and here things are no different. All three of these input methods are held up by Google's AI. And, although a keyboard may seem a poor choice of input on a screen so small, Google hopes that its machine learning algorithms are powerful enough to predict the words you want based on just the first letter or two that you enter. The three messaging input methods on Android Wear 2.0. / © Google \nWhen it comes to fitness, Google is providing interaction between fitness apps through the Google Fit API. This effectively allows apps to exchange information, such as calories burned and consumed, creating a more holistic experience. There's also activity recognition, so when you begin running, this can automatically be detected by a running app, which can begin timing your run, or counting your calories burned, for example. \nThere's also a Material Design overhaul of the Android Wear interface. This can be seen immediately in how notifications appear. Android Wear 2.0 sees a Material Design visual overhaul. / © Google When is my smartwatch getting the Android Wear 2.0 update? \nNewer smartwatches like the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style and the Huawei Watch 2 are shipping with Android Wear 2.0, but many older smartwatches will get the update as well. \nAccording to the Android Wear support forum community manager , seven more smartwatches will be receiving the update between the end of April and late May. These devices include the Moto 360 Gen 2, Moto 360 Sport, LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, Huawei Watch, Huawei Watch Ladies, Asus ZenWatch 2 and Asus ZenWatch 3. For more details, check out the respective manufacturer sections below. \nGoogle has indicated that it's the manufacturers who are deciding on when devices receive the upgrade, so the blame for delays can be squarely placed on the companies. \nAndroid Wear 2.0's features will breathe new life into older smartwatches starting in February 2017 when the roll out begins. The OTA updates will happen gradually throughout the year. You can find out if and when your watch is being updated below: Asus Android Wear Update",

      "text": "Last Published: Thu, Aug 17 2017. 07 37 PM IST Three Indians make it to MIT TR Innovators Under 35 list The three are: Radha Boya, researcher, University of Manchester; Suchi Saria, researcher, Johns Hopkins University; and Neha Narkhede, co-founder, Confluent Inc Radha Boya got the Innovators Under 35 award under the ‘Inventors’ category for developing the world’s narrowest fluid channel. Latest News » Slew of buyouts in education technology space signal consolidation \nMumbai : Three Indians have made it to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Review’s Innovators Under 35 list this year. The three women are: Radha Boya, a researcher from the University of Manchester’s Graphene Research Institute; Suchi Saria, a researcher from the Johns Hopkins University; and Neha Narkhede, co-founder of a Palo-Alto start-up, Confluent Inc. \nRadha Boya (32) \nBoya is a Leverhulme Fellow at the University of Manchester (UoM) in England where she is establishing a research group exploring the fundamentals and applications of atomic scale nanocapillaries. Her current work at Manchester is related to atomic scale capillaries with 2D materials. She got the Innovators Under 35 award under the ‘Inventors’ category for developing the world’s narrowest fluid channel, which could transform filtration of water and gases. She used graphene to create the nano fluidic channels. \nNanofluidics is the study and manipulation of fluids confined within nanostructures. The fluid dynamics of substances on the nanoscale differs significantly from the fluid dynamics of substances on longer scales. Nanofluidics have had a significant impact in biotechnology, medicine and clinical diagnostics with the development of lab-on-a-chip devices for PCR and related techniques. Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is a technique used to amplify, or make many copies of, a specific target region of DNA. \nBoya completed her PhD in 2012 at the Bengaluru-based Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) where she was recognised for her “Best Thesis”, following which she got funding through a series of highly competitive and prestigious international fellowships including the European Union’s Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowships. She has published 37 papers including those in Nature and Science journals, and holds 3 patents. In 2017, she also received the L’Oreal-UNESCO fellowship for women in science. Neha Narkhede got the Innovators Under 35 award under the ‘Visionaries’ category. \nNeha Narkhede (32) \nNarkhede is the co-founder and chief technology officer (CTO) of Confluent Inc., a Palo-Alto based start-up that builds Apache Kafka tools to help companies make sense of data. As an engineer at LinkedIn, Narkhede helped invent an open-source software platform called Apache Kafka to quickly process data from things like user clicks and profile updates. This prompted her to co-found Confluent and build Apache Kafka tools for companies in 2014. \nApache Kafka, as described on the company’s website, is a distributed streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Since being created and open sourced by LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka has quickly evolved from a messaging queue (a queue of messages sent between applications) to a full-fledged streaming platform. Narkhede’s interests include building and scaling large scale distributed systems. \nNarkhede did a BE in Computer Science from the University of Pune and an MS in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, US. She got the Innovators Under 35 award under the ‘Visionaries’ category. Suchi Saria got the Innovators Under 35 award under the ‘Humanitarians’ category. \nSuchi Saria (34) \nDarjeeling-born Saria, a professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Whiting School of Engineering and Bloomberg School of Public Health, got the Innovators Under 35 award under the ‘Humanitarians’ category for “putting existing medical data to work to predict sepsis risk”. Sepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. \nSaria was recognised for her efforts to write algorithms to analyze patient data and correctly predict septic shock in 85% of cases--a 60% improvement over existing screening tests. \nPrior to joining Johns Hopkins, she earned her PhD and Masters in Computer Science from Stanford University. Her interests span machine learning, computational statistics, and its applications to domains where one has to draw inferences from observing a complex, real-world system evolve over time. \nOrganized by MIT Technology Review since 1999, the prestigious Innovators Under 35 competition has honoured some of the world’s most brilliant minds such as Mark Zuckerberg, JB Straubel, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Closer home, MIT Technology Review and Mint have been organising a two-day EMTECH INDIA Conference for the last two years. The next event will be held in New Delhi at Pullman Hotel on 8-9 March, 2018. The conference is a place where technology, business, and culture converge. \nEMTECH INDIA 2018 , too, will feature 10 Top Innovators in India who are under 35 years of age when receiving the award. For the past two years, EMTECH INDIA has chosen 10 candidates from among hundreds of applicants spanning across areas such as biomedicine, computing, communications, health, education, digital, energy, materials, cybersecurity, fintech, wearables, robotics, education and transportation.

      "text": "Sunday 3 September 2017 12:20 BST Click to followThe Independent Tech \nApple's newest operating system for iPhones and iPads, iOS 11, finally launches this month. We'll learn the official release date for iOS 11 at Apple's big event on September 12; Apple calls its newest iOS \"a giant step for iPhone\" and \"a monumental leap for iPad.\" \nHere are 13 things everyone will love in the next big iPhone and iPad update: \n1. Live Photos will be much better. \nNow you can make your live photos into GIFs, which you can make bounce back and forth. Also, you can finally choose which still frame of the Live Photo is the main image, making it easier to find the perfect moment to share on social media. \n2. You’ll be able to store way more photos and videos on your phone. \nApple is changing the compression formats in iOS 11, which will allow you to store more photos and videos on your phone. Apple says you'll be able to save twice as many photos and videos on your device than in iOS 10. \n3. The App Store is getting a much-needed face-lift. \nApple is finally bringing the design language it established for newer apps like Music and News to the App Store itself. \nNot only did Apple make the App Store look cleaner, with better, bolder text, it also changed its organization. Now everyone will have a personalized \"Today\" tab to highlight unique apps and games. \nAnd speaking of games, Apple has finally dedicated a full tab of the App Store to games, making new or notable ones much easier to find. \n4. The Messages app is getting cleaned up. \nIt felt like mayhem when Apple added the app drawer to its Messages app. Suddenly, you could add stickers and GIFs and all sorts of buttons and visuals to your messages, but all the new options weren't easy to find and were somewhat overwhelming. Apple redesigned the app drawer in Messages for iOS 11, making it much easier to browse all the various stickers and emojis at your disposal. \n5. Siri sounds more natural and can translate for you. \nApple says Siri is going to get much more advanced through machine learning and artificial intelligence — it's unclear whether these changes would make Siri better to use, but at the very least, Apple has made Siri sound a bit less robotic and more natural, a bit like Amazon's Alexa assistant. \nAnd Apple is also testing a cool translation feature for Siri, where if you ask the assistant to say a certain phrase in a different language, like Chinese or Italian, it will speak on your behalf in the desired language. \n6. The iPhone keyboard is getting smarter. \nA signature feature of Google Now is finally coming to the iOS ecosystem: When you type in iOS 11, the keyboard will suggest words you may have recently viewed on your phone — from your Messages app, for example, or Safari. So when your friend texts you the name of a restaurant, it may be one of the first suggestions when you start searching for that restaurant on the web. \nAlso, you'll be able to use the keyboard with one hand — just hold the emoji key and select one-handed typing to move all the keys closer to your thumb. \n7. Apple is finally letting you manage your Control Center. \nThe Control Center was perhaps the most useful feature of iOS 7, released in 2013. By swiping up from the bottom of your screen, you could access a variety of shortcuts and buttons. Four years later, you'll finally be able to choose what those shortcuts and buttons are. \n8. Notifications are getting simplified. \nIn iOS 11, all your notifications — both recent and missed — are in one place, with no separate tabs. Just pull down from the top of the screen to see everything at once. \n9. There's a new feature that could actually save your life. \nDistracted driving is a real, deadly problem. Apple has added a clever feature that triggers Do Not Disturb mode when the iPhone is in the car to hide notifications for texts, calls, and other apps while you're driving. The feature can even notify people that you're driving and will contact them soon. \n10. Apple Maps are better, indoors and out. \nApple is adding indoor maps for hundreds of airports and shopping centers around the world, making it much easier to navigate your local mall. \nAnd speaking of navigation, Apple has finally added lane guidance to Apple Maps for more precise turn-by-turn directions. \n11. Setting up a new iPhone or iPad is much easier. \nIf you just bought a new iPhone or iPad, you can hold it close to an iOS device you already own to magically import all your settings, preferences and iCloud Keychain passwords. It helps you start using that brand-new device much more quickly than before. \n12. The volume box is moving out of your way. \nWhen you change the volume on your iPhone or iPad, a translucent box pops up in the middle of the screen. It's a bit annoying, so Apple is redesigning the volume box in iOS 11. Here's how it'll look: \nMuch better. \n13. You can instantly share Wi-Fi passwords. \nSoon, you'll no longer need to save your Wi-Fi password on a wrinkled piece of paper in a drawer somewhere. In iOS 11, if you need a Wi-Fi password for a given network, just find someone who is already using it and hold your device near theirs to transfer the password instantly. \nRead more: ",

      "title": "LiftIgniter raises $6.4M to bring website personalization to the rest of the Internet",
      "text": "You’ve probably had the experience of going to a website and seeing a lot of content that’s not really relevant. For the most part, a lot of this is organized in a way that’s either pre-defined or based on a limited number of signals that aims to sort of personalize the experience for a normal user.\nBut as time goes on and the competition for eyeballs continues to heat up, that light level of personalization probably won’t be enough. Instead, users can go to Facebook or Amazon, which have an enormous amount of data on its users, to get a much more personalized experience. Every other site that wants the attention of users needs to have a better-curated experience, and that’s what LiftIgniter is hoping to help those sites achieve. The company is raising $6.4 million in a round led by Storm Ventures. LiftIgniter has raised $8.25 million to date and was a finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016 .\nThe goal is that the software will help customize the content on any given page for a specific user, which, hopefully, makes their experience more enjoyable. Those users may then end up either coming back over and over or eventually converting to customers and buying products. It’s all designed to create a more engaging experience, which in the end will help drive additional business to these sites through either more customer conversions or simply more unique visits and page views. LiftIgniter services more than 5 billion page views a month, co-founder Adam Spector said.\n“Our view is that there should be a personalization API, just like there’s an API for text messages with Twilio or payments with Stripe,” Spector said. “Every digital property should have personalization built in. Media, e-commerce, enterprise, business-to-business SaaS, it doesn’t matter. If you create an experience for users, you should want to give them something they want. The only way to do that at scale is with machine learning.”\nEmphasized by co-founder Indraneel Mukherjee and Spector, “machine learning” part is important because the signals that users give to various websites are going to constantly be changing. As more and more users feed more and more data to the internet, having a truly engaging and personalized experience is table stakes to keep someone’s attention. A lot of companies will claim to be AI companies, but Spector says LiftIgniter has its own flavor that looks at a ton of signals that help define a profile of a user. Each signal is dependent on the last, and it’s the sum of those signals — all closely intertwined — that determines the user’s experience.\n“Our customers’ websites are living and breathing things, and the connections between every piece of content is changing,” Spector said. “The articles you write today could be super relevant to an article that’s five years old. The relevance may change over time. The world is constantly in flux, the idea of having a hard-coded, static list of connections doesn’t make sense.”\nA product like LiftIgniter certainly makes sense: you probably won’t be able to manually update your site fast enough to suit your specific visitors’ needs — especially for each individual user. But the sum of all those individual users is what will drive business, whether that’s through advertising views or purchases. Instead of manually curating a site or a shopping experience and hoping for the best, LiftIgniter tries to convince companies that it can do it at a technical level and drive results immediately.\nAnd that’s one of the core elements of the company. LiftIgniter aims to ensure that the companies are able to get some meaningful metrics of success within 30 days of deploying it. That’s key for many companies, which are looking for some kind of return on any services they employ but may not necessarily get them right away. If you’re going to A/B test and try to personalize your site in order to get users to engage with it more, you’ll want to figure out if the service is actually going to be successful. That means that the companies can, early on, define various objectives and LiftIgniter will try to determine whether it’s able to hit those kinds of targets.\nIt’s going to be a crowded space — with plenty of competition from companies like Google — as companies race to build these kinds of products for companies. They’re going to become mission-critical tools for the rest of the world going forward as Facebook and other services train users to become completely accustomed to very personalized content. LiftIgniter hopes that creating a sort of blanket tool that any site can employ, as well as very quickly demonstrating some success, will give it a competitive edge to survive.\n“We’re literally diverging from ourselves in every moment,” Spector said. “Humans adjust to a changing environment well. Our goals are going to be able to adjust for that and give users what they want. There’s no way I could consume every article. I should find the article I care about with a minimal amount of effort. Without that, they bounce back to Google, or Facebook, and then we outsource their discovery to Facebook and Google.”\n ",

      "text": "\nDonald Trump Gage Skidmore/Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0) Trump’s first list of science priorities ignores climate—and departs from his own budget request By Jeffrey Mervis Aug. 17, 2017 , 1:40 PM \nPresident Donald Trump has translated his campaign promise to “make America great again” into his administration’s first blueprint for federal investment in science and technology. \nThe White House today issued a four-page memo telling federal agencies that their research dollars should be focused on delivering short-term dividends in strengthening national defense and border security, the economy, and “energy dominance,” as well as improving public health. It says achieving those goals should not require additional spending, and that agencies should focus primarily on basic science, and then step aside as quickly as possible to let industry pursue any results that show commercial promise. \nThe memo, written jointly by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), is an annual reminder of the administration’s research priorities sent to agencies before they submit their next budget request. Those requests are due next month for the 2019 fiscal year that starts in October 2018. (Congress has yet to act on the budget for the 2018 fiscal year, which begins 1 October; most observers expect lawmakers to extend current spending levels well into the new fiscal year.) \nThe memos typically don’t change much from year to year. But this is the first one from the new Trump administration. And it comes even as the White House lacks a presidential science adviser and OSTP director. It’s co-signed by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and Michael Kratsios, a deputy assistant to the president, who since March has also been acting as OSTP's head. \nThe memo lists five priority areas (in this order): military superiority, security, prosperity, energy dominance, and health. Each is prefaced by the word “American” in keeping with the administration’s approach to branding issues. \nThe phrase “basic research” appears only in connection with prosperity, the third target area. Agencies are told to “continue, and expand where necessary, efforts to focus on basic research” to promote “emerging technologies such as autonomous systems, biometrics, energy storage, gene editing, machine learning, and quantum computing.” Even then, however, agencies are directed to “reduce funding overlaps with industry in later-stage research, development, and deployment of [these] technologies.” \nIn the health arena, the memo says “agencies should prioritize research focused on solutions for an aging population, as well as on combating drug addiction and other public health crises.” It also lists research “that will lead to more efficient and effective healthcare.” \nBeyond the obvious differences with Obama’s approach, this guidance also doesn’t have a lot of similarities with President Trump’s own 2018 budget request. Matthew Hourihan, AAAS \nThe guidance on energy says the goal of federal research investments should be “a consistent, long-term supply of lower-cost American energy.” That goal, it asserts, can be achieved through “a clean energy portfolio composed of fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy sources.” \nIt should be no surprise that Trump’s list differs markedly from previous memos from the Barack Obama administration. Obama’s top five multiagency research priorities for his 2017 budget, for example, were global climate change, clean energy, Earth observations, advanced manufacturing, and innovation in the life sciences, biology, and neuroscience. Three items on that list—climate research, Earth observations, and advanced manufacturing—are completely absent from Trump’s priorities. So are biology-based initiatives pushed by Obama, including the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. Reaction \nThe initial reaction from some veteran federal budget watchers is bemusement. “Beyond the obvious differences with Obama’s approach, this guidance also doesn’t have a lot of similarities with President Trump’s own 2018 budget request,” says Matthew Hourihan, who analyzes federal research spending for AAAS in Washington, D.C. (which publishes Science Insider). Hourihan contrasted the memo’s focus on support for breakthrough military technologies, technology to prevent terror attacks, and helping older Americans remain healthy with the large cuts for those same areas that Trump has proposed. \nHourihan says the budget guidance’s support for so-called “precommercial technology” in energy would suggest the administration would support for the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, whose mission is to explore promising ideas too risky for industry. Yet Trump has asked Congress to shut down the $300 million agency, launched in 2009. (The Senate has balked at that idea.) \nKei Koizumi, who headed OSTP’s research analysis shop during the Obama administration and is now at AAAS, says the memo is consistent with Trump’s emphasis in his 2018 budget on “defense first, security second, with the economy, energy, and health after that.” But he notes that it is silent on many important activities, including support for international collaborations and for training the next generation of scientists apart from improving the technical skills of the overall U.S. workforce. “There’s also no mention of space,” he notes, despite the recent relaunching of the National Space Council. In his view, “the memo shows that the administration doesn't have science and technology priorities as such.” Posted in: ",

      "text": " Photo Credit Stephen Lam/Getty Images CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — On Wednesday, Facebook revealed that hundreds of Russia-based accounts had run anti-Hillary Clinton ads precisely aimed at Facebook users whose demographic profiles implied a vulnerability to political propaganda. It will take time to prove whether the account owners had any relationship with the Russian government, but one thing is clear: Facebook has contributed to, and profited from, the erosion of democratic norms in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe audacity of a hostile foreign power trying to influence American voters rightly troubles us. But it should trouble us more that Facebook makes such manipulation so easy, and renders political ads exempt from the basic accountability and transparency that healthy democracy demands.\nThe majority of the Facebook ads did not directly mention a presidential candidate, according to Alex Stamos, head of security at Facebook, but “appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.”\nThe ads — about 3,000 placed by 470 accounts and pages spending about $100,000 — were what the advertising industry calls “dark posts,” seen only by a very specific audience, obscured by the flow of posts within a Facebook News Feed and ephemeral. Facebook calls its “dark post” service “unpublished page post ads.”\nAdvertisement\n This should not surprise us. Anyone can deploy Facebook ads. They are affordable and easy. That’s one reason that Facebook has grown so quickly, taking in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, virtually all of it from advertisers, by serving up the attention of two billion Facebook users across the globe.\n Advertisement\n The service is popular among advertisers for its efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness. Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more. There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it’s being used for commerce instead of politics. What’s alarming is that Facebook executives don’t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.\nA core principle in political advertising is transparency — political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from. And it’s expensive to run even one version of an ad in traditional outlets, let alone a dozen different versions. Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.\nNewsletter Sign Up Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime None of that transparency matters to Facebook. Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing. The potential for abuse is vast. An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened. Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.\nUnfortunately, the range of potential responses to this problem is limited. The First Amendment grants broad protections to publishers like Facebook. Diplomacy, even the harsh kind, has failed to dissuade Russia from meddling. And it’s even less likely to under the current administration.\nDaniel Kreiss, a communication scholar at the University of North Carolina, proposes that sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a repository of campaign ads so that regulators, scholars, journalists and the public can examine and expose them. But the companies have no impetus to concur and coordinate. And Congress is unlikely to reform a system that campaigns are just learning to master.\nFacebook has no incentive to change its ways. The money is too great. The issue is too nebulous to alienate more than a few Facebook users. The more that Facebook saturates our lives, families and communities, the harder it is to live without it.\nFacebook has pledged to install better filtering systems using artificial intelligence and machine-learning to flag accounts that are run by automated “bots” or violate the site’s terms of service. But these are just new versions of the technologies that have caused the problem in the first place. And there would be no accountability beyond Facebook’s word. The fact remains that in the arms race to keep propaganda flowing, human beings review troublesome accounts only long after the damage has been done.\nAdvertisement\n Our best hopes sit in Brussels and London. European regulators have been watching Facebook and Google for years. They have taken strong actions against both companies for violating European consumer data protection standards and business competition laws. The British government is investigating the role Facebook and its use of citizens’ data played in the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 national elections.\nWe are in the midst of a worldwide, internet-based assault on democracy. Scholars at the Oxford Internet Institute have tracked armies of volunteers and bots as they move propaganda across Facebook and Twitter in efforts to undermine trust in democracy or to elect their preferred candidates in the Philippines, India, France, the Netherlands, Britain and elsewhere. We now know that agents in Russia are exploiting the powerful Facebook advertising system directly.\nIn the 21st-century social media information war, faith in democracy is the first casualty.",

      "text": "Delingpole: Global Warming Is Almost Entirely Natural, Study Confirms AP Photo/Heribert Proepper by James Delingpole 22 Aug 2017 0 \n22 Aug, 2017 22 Aug, 2017 Most global warming is natural and even if there had been no Industrial Revolution current global temperatures would be almost exactly the same as they are now, a study has found. The paper , by Australian scientists John Abbot and Jennifer Marohasy, published in GeoResJ uses the latest big data technique to analyse six 2,000 year-long proxy temperature series from different geographic regions. “Proxies” are the markers scientists use – tree rings, sediments, pollen, etc – to try assess global temperature trends in the days before the existence of thermometers. All the evidence suggests that the planet was about a degree warmer during the Medieval Warming Period than it is now; and that there is nothing unnatural or unprecedented about late 20th century and early 21st century “climate change”.\nadvertisement This contradicts the claims of alarmist scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that “man made” global warming is a worrying and dangerous phenomenon.\nTime-series profiles derived from temperature proxies such as tree rings can provide information about past climate. Signal analysis was undertaken of six such datasets, and the resulting component sine waves used as input to an artificial neural network (ANN), a form of machine learning. By optimizing spectral features of the component sine waves, such as periodicity, amplitude and phase, the original temperature profiles were approximately simulated for the late Holocene period to 1830 CE. The ANN models were then used to generate projections of temperatures through the 20th century. The largest deviation between the ANN projections and measured temperatures for six geographically distinct regions was approximately 0.2 °C, and from this an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of approximately 0.6 °C was estimated. This is considerably less than estimates from the General Circulation Models (GCMs) used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and similar to estimates from spectroscopic methods.\nIn fact as the chart shows, recent warming is well within the planet’s natural historic climate boundaries:\n\nAccording to co-author Jennifer Mahorasy – who was behind the recent exposure of the scandal in which Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology was found to be erasing record-breaking low temperatures from its records – global temperature has moved up and down quite naturally for the last 2000 years.\nWe began by deconstructing the six-proxy series from different geographic regions – series already published in the mainstream climate science literature. One of these, the Northern Hemisphere composite series begins in 50 AD, ends in the year 2000, and is derived from studies of pollen, lake sediments, stalagmites and boreholes.\nTypical of most such temperature series, it zigzags up and down while showing two rising trends: the first peaks about 1200 AD and corresponds with a period known as the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), while the second peaks in 1980 and then shows decline. In between, is the Little Ice Age (LIA), which according to the Northern Hemisphere composite bottomed-out in 1650 AD. (Of course, the MWP corresponded with a period of generally good harvests in England – when men dressed in tunics and built grand cathedrals with tall spires. It preceded the LIA when there was famine and the Great Plague of London.)\nUp until the 1990s, this was widely accepted by the climate science community. But then came a concerted effort led by alarmists including Michael “Hockey Stick” Mann to erase the Medieval Warming Period from the records. Scientists who argued otherwise – among them Willie Soon and Sallie Balliunas – were harassed for their “incorrect” thinking.\nHowever, the new study would appear to confirm that t he skeptics were right all along – and that it’s the alarmists who have some apologizing to do.\nTo be clear, while mainstream climate science is replete with published proxy temperature studies showing that temperatures have cycled up and down over the last 2,000 years – spiking during the Medieval Warm Period and then again recently to about 1980 as shown in Figure 12 – the official IPCC reconstructions (which underpin the Paris Accord) deny such cycles. Through this denial, leaders from within this much-revered community can claim that there is something unusual about current temperatures: that we have catastrophic global warming from industrialisation.\nIn our new paper in GeoResJ, we not only use the latest techniques in big data to show that there would very likely have been significant warming to at least 1980 in the absence of industrialisation, we also calculate an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of 0.6°C. This is the temperature increase expected from a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. This is an order of magnitude less than estimates from General Circulation Models, but in accordance from values generated from experimental spectroscopic studies, and other approaches reported in the scientific literature [9,10,11,12,13,14].\nThe science is far from settled. In reality, some of the data is ‘problematic’, the underlying physical mechanisms are complex and poorly understood, the literature voluminous, and new alternative techniques (such as our method using ANNs) can give very different answers to those derived from General Circulation Models and remodelled proxy-temperature series.\nRead More Stories About: Big Government , Environment , Australia's Bureau of Meteorology , Climate Change , global temperature trends , Global Warming , Industrial Revolution , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , Jennifer Marohasy , John Abbot , Medieval Warm Period",

      "text": "China Is Using America’s Own Plan to Dominate the Future of Artificial Intelligence The Chinese are massively investing in AI research and tech, while the Trump administration is cutting federal programs wholesale. By Gregory Allen Gregory C. Allen is an adjunct fellow in the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. In July 2017, his report “Artificial Intelligence and National Security” was published by the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. , Elsa B. Kania Elsa B. Kania is an independent analyst focused on the Chinese military, emerging technologies, and defense innovation. She is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and contributed to the English translation of China’s new AI plan released through New America. September 8, 2017 \nIn late 2016, the Obama administration published three reports that shared an extraordinary conclusion: advances in machine learning, a technology that allows systems to learn and improve without explicit programming, are enabling a revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI). As AI systems become increasingly capable of not only routine tasks like driving a car, but also complicated ones like designing car engines , AI technology will be the driving force behind transformations across both the economy and national security . \nIf imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the authors of the Obama administration reports have received a heartfelt compliment from their Chinese counterparts. With China’s July 2017 Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan , the country has announced that it, too, sees AI as the transformative technology that will underpin future economic and military power. China’s plan calls for exceeding all other nations in AI by 2030, but the checklist for China’s ambitious agenda is strikingly similar to the policies prescribed by the Obama administration’s reports. Greatly increase long-term investment in AI research and development (R&D)? Check. Promote collaboration on AI between the private tech sector and the government? Check. Develop a pipeline of top AI talent? Check. Invest to mitigate AI’s potential risks and societal disruptions? Check. The similarities go beyond such high-level objectives, even including many specific policy details and recommendations. \nA reader of both documents would be forgiven for concluding that the Chinese strategy’s authors had copies of the White House reports on their desks as they wrote. Unlike a college term paper, however, there are no extra points for originality in governance. All that matters is to have the right policies and to implement them effectively. Unfortunately, there is plenty of reason to worry that China may have an edge in implementing policies practically cribbed from the United States. \nThe Obama administration sought to increase support for AI R&D, since annual federal funding for all computer science and mathematics R&D is less than half of what Google alone spends. Rather than boosting those levels, the Trump administration’s budget calls for cutting AI research at the National Science Foundation by 10 percent, to a mere $175 million. China, meanwhile, has demonstrated a willingness to spend jaw-dropping sums on technology when there are strategic national interests at play. For instance, in 2014, the Chinese government announced a 1 trillion RMB ($150 billion) investment fund to turn the Chinese semiconductor industry into a global powerhouse. Those figures are not merely hype. By 2017, the government had already made a third of that sum available. Similarly, China’s new plan foreshadows massive increases in funding for AI R&D. \nOne might think that U.S. government support for AI R&D is not terribly important, so long as U.S. companies lead the way. Perhaps that’s true in sectors like health care , but the U.S. companies with the best AI technology are often considerably less willing to invest in national security applications. When Google acquired DeepMind, arguably the world’s leading AI R&D organization, DeepMind required Google to prohibit the use of their research for military and government surveillance purposes. When Google acquired a leading military robotics developer, Google announced that the firm would no longer accept military contracts. And Google is far more cooperative with the national security community than most tech companies. \nChinese firms are less reluctant to make these distinctions. As China pursues a strategy of “military-civil fusion” in AI, it wields a range of policy mechanisms to incentivize industry cooperation. This summer, Tsinghua University — considered “China’s MIT”— announced plans to establish a Military-Civil Fusion lab that will provide a platform for dual-use advances in AI. Also this year, China established its first national deep-learning laboratory under the leadership of Baidu — often called “China’s Google” – and in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Beihang University. (Beihang University also happens to be a leader in the development of Chinese military aerospace technologies, including autonomous systems and robotics.) \nNo Chinese company has more enthusiastically embraced AI technology than Baidu. Despite lagging its U.S. and Chinese competitors in the mobile era, Baidu is reinventing itself around AI. Under the leadership of AI pioneer Andrew Ng, who until this March served as Baidu’s chief scientist and head of AI R&D, Baidu’s 1,300-person AI team achieved impressive results, developing better-than-human speech recognition software a year before Western companies and building out Baidu’s well-respected machine-learning cloud-infrastructure team. Ng’s departure was a significant setback, but Baidu remains focused on AI. Qi Lu, a former Microsoft executive and a leading AI specialist, has joined Baidu as chief operating officer. \nOverall, Chinese tech companies are not as far behind as many in the West assume. This year, nearly all of the top-performing teams in the ImageNet Challenge, an influential AI competition, were from China . iFLYTEK, a Chinese AI startup, currently ranks second in the reading comprehension tasks measured by the Stanford Question Answering Dataset leaderboard, besting teams from Microsoft and Google, among others. While not yet the overall leaders in AI technology, Chinese researchers have proven their ability to catch up quickly and produce genuine innovation. \nAs China and other nations increasingly with the U.S. in key military technologies such as precision guided munitions and stealth aircraft, the Department of Defense that AI will enable it to maintain military technological supremacy well into the 21st century. That’s a worthwhile goal, but achieving it will require that the United States not merely have a strategy, but also implement it better and faster than other countries. The Defense Department has sought to deepen ties with Silicon Valley to bring cutting-edge AI tech to the Pentagon, but even Defense Secretary James Mattis acknowledges that thus far the Pentagon has been challenged in these efforts. \nHere too, China is embracing and implementing America’s strategy. Ng led Baidu’s AI efforts from the firm’s Silicon Valley campus. Since his departure, Baidu has announced plans to add a second site in the area. Tencent, the Chinese social media giant that both Facebook and Snapchat have confessed to imitating, has also moved in . \nChinese companies believe that by rotating Chinese staff to Silicon Valley and American staff to Chinese campuses, they can accelerate the timeline for reaching parity with the United States in AI technology and depth of talent. At present, however, the size and experience of China’s AI workforce remains dwarfed by that of the United States. Half of the top 10 employers of AI talent in China are U.S. firms, including IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, who may thus be integral to the development of China’s human capital in AI. \nChina’s copying of America’s homework could be a positive development if it deepens our understanding of the risks brought about by the rise of AI and how to mitigate them. The 2016 White House report addressed the workforce challenges of AI head on. Larry Summers, who served as Obama’s first director of the National Economic Council, predicts that the rise of AI in the economy could bring about “a third of men between the ages of 25 and 54 not working by the end of this half century.” Such an unemployment rate would be higher than that endured by Germany during the Great Depression when the Nazi Party came to power. \nChina’s AI plan likewise shows a clear understanding that increased automation is likely to reduce demand for labor across many sectors, putting societal stability (and perhaps the legitimacy and survival of the Communist Party) at risk. That why China’s strategy includes a call for a new regulatory focus on the ethical, security, and governance challenges of AI, including workforce displacement. Like the Obama plan, the Chinese plan also calls for government action to mitigate the economic pain and social instability of worker displacement. China’s government-led transition of hundreds of millions of laborers from agriculture to manufacturing shows that it has experience in this area, but for now its AI-related efforts remain at the planning stage. With official GDP growth rates still above 6 percent, China’s near-term problem is actually a labor shortage. \nUnfortunately, the United States is no longer attempting to plan for these challenges. The current U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, has stated that AI workforce issues are “not even on our radar screen.” The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which was instrumental in leading AI policy work during the Obama administration, has been essentially depleted of staff , with more than 70 out of 100 positions unfilled. The current administration has effectively deprived itself of critical expertise and insights on AI. \nWithout a recognition of the historic challenges of artificial intelligence — or a focus on preparing workers, soldiers, and diplomats for the future — will the United States be able to withstand AI’s disruptions or maintain competitiveness? Though China’s success in implementing its highly ambitious AI strategy remains to be seen, China’s actions are a clear indication of governmental commitment to this agenda at the highest levels. At this point, the United States is failing to implement the sensible and ambitious AI policy that the Obama administration left behind. Meanwhile, China is using the Obama playbook to stride boldly forward into the AI revolution. \nPhoto Credit: ISAAC LAWRENCE/AFP/Getty Images Share + ",

      "text": "THE human face is a remarkable piece of work. The astonishing variety of facial features helps people recognise each other and is crucial to the formation of complex societies. So is the face’s ability to send emotional signals, whether through an involuntary blush or the artifice of a false smile. People spend much of their waking lives, in the office and the courtroom as well as the bar and the bedroom, reading faces, for signs of attraction, hostility, trust and deceit. They also spend plenty of time trying to dissimulate.\nTechnology is rapidly catching up with the human ability to read faces. In America facial recognition is used by churches to track worshippers’ attendance; in Britain, by retailers to spot past shoplifters. This year Welsh police used it to arrest a suspect outside a football game. In China it verifies the identities of ride-hailing drivers, permits tourists to enter attractions and lets people pay for things with a smile. Apple’s new iPhone is expected to use it to unlock the homescreen (see article ).\n  5   5   16   21   21 hours ago Retail   Set against human skills, such applications might seem incremental. Some breakthroughs, such as flight or the internet, obviously transform human abilities; facial recognition seems merely to encode them. Although faces are peculiar to individuals, they are also public, so technology does not, at first sight, intrude on something that is private. And yet the ability to record, store and analyse images of faces cheaply, quickly and on a vast scale promises one day to bring about fundamental changes to notions of privacy, fairness and trust.\nThe final frontier\nStart with privacy. One big difference between faces and other biometric data, such as fingerprints, is that they work at a distance. Anyone with a phone can take a picture for facial-recognition programs to use. FindFace, an app in Russia, compares snaps of strangers with pictures on VKontakte, a social network, and can identify people with a 70% accuracy rate. Facebook’s bank of facial images cannot be scraped by others, but the Silicon Valley giant could obtain pictures of visitors to a car showroom, say, and later use facial recognition to serve them ads for cars. Even if private firms are unable to join the dots between images and identity, the state often can. China’s government keeps a record of its citizens’ faces; photographs of half of America’s adult population are stored in databases that can be used by the FBI. Law-enforcement agencies now have a powerful weapon in their ability to track criminals, but at enormous potential cost to citizens’ privacy.\nThe face is not just a name-tag. It displays a lot of other information—and machines can read that, too. Again, that promises benefits. Some firms are analysing faces to provide automated diagnoses of rare genetic conditions, such as Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, far earlier than would otherwise be possible. Systems that measure emotion may give autistic people a grasp of social signals they find elusive. But the technology also threatens. Researchers at Stanford University have demonstrated that, when shown pictures of one gay man, and one straight man, the algorithm could attribute their sexuality correctly 81% of the time. Humans managed only 61% (see article ). In countries where homosexuality is a crime, software which promises to infer sexuality from a face is an alarming prospect.\nKeys, wallet, balaclava\nLess violent forms of discrimination could also become common. Employers can already act on their prejudices to deny people a job. But facial recognition could make such bias routine, enabling firms to filter all job applications for ethnicity and signs of intelligence and sexuality. Nightclubs and sports grounds may face pressure to protect people by scanning entrants’ faces for the threat of violence—even though, owing to the nature of machine-learning, all facial-recognition systems inevitably deal in probabilities. Moreover, such systems may be biased against those who do not have white skin, since algorithms trained on data sets of mostly white faces do not work well with different ethnicities. Such biases have cropped up in automated assessments used to inform courts’ decisions about bail and sentencing.\nEventually, continuous facial recording and gadgets that paint computerised data onto the real world might change the texture of social interactions. Dissembling helps grease the wheels of daily life. If your partner can spot every suppressed yawn, and your boss every grimace of irritation, marriages and working relationships will be more truthful, but less harmonious. The basis of social interactions might change, too, from a set of commitments founded on trust to calculations of risk and reward derived from the information a computer attaches to someone’s face. Relationships might become more rational, but also more transactional.\nIn democracies, at least, legislation can help alter the balance of good and bad outcomes. European regulators have embedded a set of principles in forthcoming data-protection regulation, decreeing that biometric information, which would include “faceprints”, belongs to its owner and that its use requires consent—so that, in Europe, unlike America, Facebook could not just sell ads to those car-showroom visitors. Laws against discrimination can be applied to an employer screening candidates’ images. Suppliers of commercial face-recognition systems might submit to audits, to demonstrate that their systems are not propagating bias unintentionally. Firms that use such technologies should be held accountable.\nSuch rules cannot alter the direction of travel, however. Cameras will only become more common with the spread of wearable devices. Efforts to bamboozle facial-recognition systems, from sunglasses to make-up, are already being overtaken; research from the University of Cambridge shows that artificial intelligence can reconstruct the facial structures of people in disguise. Google has explicitly turned its back on matching faces to identities, for fear of its misuse by undemocratic regimes. Other tech firms seem less picky. Amazon and Microsoft are both using their cloud services to offer face recognition; it is central to Facebook’s plans. Governments will not want to forgo its benefits. Change is coming. Face up to it.\nDig deeper Science and technology (1): Advances in AI are used to spot signs of sexuality Science and technology (2): Researchers produce images of people’s faces from their genomes Business: Ever better and cheaper, face-recognition technology is spreading \nThis article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline \"Nowhere to hide\"",
