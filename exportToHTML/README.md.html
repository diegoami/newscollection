<span class="s0"># TECH NEWS AGGREGATOR 
 
## Background 
 
### General purpose 
 
The general idea is to build a technology news portal aggregating tech news from several sources and draw conclusions from them 
 
* find articles discussing the same news item as a provided text, but from a different source 
* get a different angle about a specific news item or topic from a different source 
* find controversial news in a period of time, that have been treated seperately from several sources. 
 
## Possible development 
 
I am also considering following developments 
 
* Work as a recommender system - find articles whose topics is related to the one you have selected 
  * at first these recommendations would be stateless, but it can be extended to remember previous user choices 
 
* Categorize articles / texts based on tags and authors of articles in the database, to try and help to get recommendations 
 
* Implement a real smart search engine over the database of technical articles 
 
## Dataset 
 
 
Currently the dataset includes all technical articles that have been published between 01/01/2017 and 04/10/2017 on following tech sources 
 
* Techcrunch (http://www.techcrunch.com) 
* The Verge  (http://www.theverge.com) 
* The next web (http://www.thenextweb.com 
* Venture beat (http://www.venturebeat.com) 
 
I am planning to update models with articles as they are published and add the following sources 
 
* Ars Technica (http://www.arstechnica.com) 
* Wired (http://www.wired.com) 
So far it is about 30.000 articles - my target is having a database of about 100.000 articles and keep it updated. 
I have already built a scraper and a database for that. 
 
## Currently deployed 
 
### Prototype 
 
A prototype is currently accessible at http://ec2-35-156-126-138.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080 
 
 
### Finding Related articles 
 
The idea behind this is that after you find an article on the web, you would want to find another article talking about the same topic from a different source. 
 
This works also as a recommandation system, because it should find articles talking about related topics. 
 
You can copy the text of a technical article into this text page : http://ec2-35-156-126-138.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/search  and find similar articles in the dataset, possibly limiting the search in a date interval. From there you can copy the URL of an article in the database and see related articles in http://ec2-35-156-126-138.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/search_url 
 
Alternatively, you can see how articles in the database related to each other entering the url of an article in 
 
### Similar articles and conteroversial topics 
 
The second application is finding &quot;controversial&quot; topics in a date range. From the page http://ec2-35-156-126-138.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/duplicates/0' you can browse through the articles that have been paired because the system considers it likely that they are talking  about the same topic, possibly under a different slant - each with a score. 
 
You can help validate this pairings using the tool at http://ec2-35-156-126-138.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080 
 
## Technologys used 
 
I am still in the exploring phase as to what technology I should use. So far I built the prototype using Gensim in connection with Tfidf / BoW (first approach) and Doc2Vec. The results are already decent but it seems that there is great room for improvement. In particular: 
 
* Tfidf/BoW seems to be very slow but it comes probably also from a suboptimal implementation of my part 
* Doc2vec's results are very misleading for short sentences and short articles, as the length of an article seems to be one of the main features to decide whether articles are similar 
 
## Issues 
 
* I am looking for ways to include other features to improve the score of similarity between two articles, apart from the text itself. In particular 
 
  * Articles published around the same date are more likely to be related 
  * So are articles having similar tags and from the same author and source 
 
* On the other hand, when wishing to show articles about the same topic from different sources, I would want to penalize articles from the same source or author, as I am looking for a different angle. 
 
* I am also striving to be able to limit search only on a subset of the dataset, (especially date) even after having trained the models on all of the articles. 
 
* The update of articles in the database is still not automatized
